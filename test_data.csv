It will take place between April 2020 and March 2021. An electronic data collection notebook (REDCap) will be designed where the data will be entered anonymously. Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be included, microbiological samples from the mother and the newborn will be collected and processed (PCR-SARS-CoV-2 in a delayed manner) and clinical data related to the patient, the infection, its treatment and complications. , pregnancy and complications, childbirth and the newborn. The results will be disclosed to the scientific community, society and health authorities.",4,4b
C06368,"Diagnosis and monitoring of mutations in SARS-CoV-2, other viruses and opportunistic microorganisms that cause respiratory diseases in humans","The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, as of December 2019 and has spread rapidly to an increasing number of countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared SARS-CoV-2 infection as a pandemic. Efforts to contain the virus are underway; however, given the many uncertainties regarding the transmissibility and virulence of the virus, the effectiveness of these efforts is still unknown. Many molecular biology methods are being used for the diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. The detection methodology most used today is the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR). Despite the great sensitivity, it is known that there are cases of false negatives, probably due to the loss or degradation of the viral RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome in the position of the primers and probes used. In addition, the demand for reagents for RT-PCR has increased considerably in the last few months, and there are not enough reagents being produced to meet global demand. The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological feature that modulates the pandemic potential of an emerging respiratory virus. In addition, the test is specific for SARS-CoV-2, and does not test for other possible viruses that cause respiratory diseases, such as influenza. Therefore, the development of alternative methods, with high sensitivity, is essential to accompany the pandemic and the diversity of viruses and circulating strains.Next generation sequencing (NGS) provides a new and effective way to track samples and detect viruses without prior knowledge of the infectious agent. NGS strategies can provide additional confirmation, in addition to diagnosing other viruses, with strain specific discrimination in a single test. The monitoring of recurrent mutations in these viruses, including mutations in proteins responsible for the mechanism of entry into the host cell, has an impact on the understanding of pathogenicity and the composition of vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States annually uses information on genetic changes in influenza viruses to determine whether vaccines and antiviral drugs will work against current influenza viruses. The same monitoring should be used for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, with NGS it is possible to identify the airway microbiota and have a better prognosis for the evolution of the disease. Thus, understanding the associated microbiota can help to predict the outcome and reduce complications. Therefore, it is proposed here to use molecular biology strategies, such as new generation sequencing to diagnose viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory diseases and to monitor the mutational diversity of circulating strains. The evolution and rate of infection observed to date show an urgent need to develop public health activities to better understand the epidemiology of the new virus and characterize its potential impact on public health.",1,"1a, 1b, 1c"
C09498,Learning from the impact of and recovery from COVID-19 within prisons: the effect of COVID-19 management and the environment on wellbeing and harm.,"COVID-19 is a particular challenge within the prison setting given the vulnerable nature of the population (in terms of emotional dysregulation, mental health difficulties, rates of suicide, self harm and violence); the characteristics of individuals (e.g. high rates of BAME) and the physical conditions (e.g. difficulties of introducing social distancing without the potential for exclusion). This research uses a carefully selected subgroup (those accessing the Offender Personality Disorder Pathway across 34 prison sites) as a case study from which to generalise across the prison context. The combination of quantitative methods (using linear mixed modelling to examine extensive and existing data) and qualitative research (based on interviews with a purposive sample) will enable this research to determine a) the impacts of prison restrictions implemented in response to COVID-19 and the subsequent easing of these on psychological and behavioral outcomes and b) to identify key factors associated with differences in response to restrictions / easing. Understanding and learning from the impact of COVID-19 and the resultant management responses within prisons is essential in order to identify how to build resilience in readiness for further restrictive measures which may be needed during subsequent 'outbreak waves'. Such findings will also have long term implications with regard to effective practices in the context of a return to standard operating status which might enhance the existing prison regime. Finally, this research will also allow us to examine whether certain groups (e.g. ethnic groups) experience a disproportionate impact in prison, as occurs in the wider/non-prison community.",10,"10a, 10b"

Another focus of this application is the integration and funding of measures that address the new epidemiological situation caused by the Covid 19 pandemic.  In order to achieve the objectives of the project, the main focus of activities will be on the maintenance of the TB Sequel Cohort. This will be done by continuing the follow-up in 2022 with at least one physical study visit and one additional phone call. At both visits, the most relevant morbidity and mortality data and soc-econ. data with respect to the outcomes studied in TB Sequel to date will be collected. Data will be collected (and clinical samples taken) and either analysed in conjunction with TB Sequel data (2017-2021) or processed and published as part of a stand-alone analysis.  In addition to the continuation of the cohort, the coordinators or various investigators of Research Tasks 1-5 will also conduct new studies and investigations that have a completely new aspect to the research subject (e.g. interaction between TB and Covid-19), but are relevant to specific questions in the new funding period, or serve to directly prepare the further funding period (e.g. review and interviews on local infrastructures regarding the future treatment and therapy of patients with post-TB lung disease).",4,4z

C15135,Mechanisms and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2-induced neutrophil extracellular traps,"Project Summary/Abstract  The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first formally described in 1967, but it has likely been the  predominant cause of death in pandemic viral infections for centuries. Now, the world is at grips with a new  pandemic from SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, which has infected over 100 million people worldwide resulting in  >2 million deaths. Central to the immunopathogenesis of ARDS is the role of neutrophils and neutrophil  activation, including the release of neutrophil chromatin into the extracellular space in a process termed  neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs. Originally described as a form of host defense to inactivate pathogens,  NETs have emerged as a potentially maladaptive response to infections, producing substantial bystander injury  to tissues and serving as a nidus for coagulation. We have shown that NETs are produced in response to both  sterile and pathogen-induced acute lung injury (including Influenza A), and when neutralized, lung injury is  reduced without compromising microbial containment. We have also shown that NETs are increased in the  plasma of patients with ARDS and associate with more severe ARDS and ARDS mortality. Emerging reports  indicate that NETs are also present in the blood and lungs of COVID-19 patients. We are now positioned to  rapidly test the role of NETs in response to SARS-CoV-2 in this application, and to develop novel approaches to  neutralize NETs for therapeutic purposes. In Aim 1, we will challenge neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2 virus or  spike protein to determine the production of NETs and NET-induction molecular pathways. We hypothesize that  secreted neutrophil proteases and NETs themselves will cleave spike protein to prime for enhanced viral  pathogenesis. We will also embark on unbiased studies of neutrophil proteins using mass spectrometry to  determine novel pathways of neutrophil activation resulting from SARS-CoV-2, including from neutrophils  isolated from COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will turn our attention to a mouse model of COVID-19 in which  mouse strains expressing human ACE2 will be challenged with SARS-CoV-2 and lung injury, NETs, and  systemic effects measured. We hypothesize that NETs will be produced and predominantly localize to the  alveolar spaces. We will use mice with gain and loss of function mutations in NET pathways (PAD4-/-, DNase1-  /-, DNase1L3-/-) to test for their pathogenicity in this model. In these studies, we will also test a novel DNase to  neutralize NETs into non-toxic mononucleosomes, which could be rapidly deployed to COVID-19 patients.  Finally, we will test for the role of NET-associated platelet activation, complement activation, and coagulation  responses, and therapeutic strategies to mitigate these systemic effects. In summary, these studies will establish  new knowledge on neutrophil activation and the definitive role of NETs in COVID-19 and identify therapeutic  approaches to target NETs in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.","1, 6","1b, 1d, 6a"
C09949,"Downloading a new normal - privacy, exclusion, and information behaviour in public library digital services use during COVID","The necessity to switch from analogue to digital in so much day-to-day living has been the overarching experience of the COVID lockdown for many of the UK population. This project explores ""the digital turn"" and how compelled use of digital services during COVID lockdown and beyond has impacted one specific sector, namely public libraries across the UK. In doing so it considers issues that have been faced in other public and private organisations across society because of the lockdown, such as (1)privacy and ethical issues in the utilisation of digital in the spaces that were previously overtly analogue in nature, (2)linked issues of digital exclusion and ensuring equity of access, and (3)how information behaviours have adapted and/or been impacted across age groups and other societal demographics.    The example of the borrowing of a book brings home the issues; this universally-understood activity of visiting a library building, browsing shelves, and leaving with a physical book has been replaced with (1)visiting library website (2)downloading an app (3)logging into a third party vendor's service (4)agreeing their privacy policy, and (5)navigating their interface to download your content. This is a significant departure from the traditional experience, and raises important issues around privacy, digital equity, and information behaviour that we need to understand. By utilising FoI queries, readability and content analysis of library websites and 3rd party privacy policies, a nationwide survey of library users, and eight UK-wide focus groups, we will gain important insights into how compelled use of digital has impacted society.",10,10d

C14333,"GCRF_NF362 Socio-economic, wellbeing and human rights related experiences of people with disabilities in Covid-19 times in South Africa","People with disabilities (PWD) are recognised globally as a large but often excluded and disadvantaged minority. The South African White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (WPRD) (DSD 2016) estimates 12% of South Africans live with a disability. The South African (SA) government has ratified various international and regional disability treaties, but has no specific legislation for disability rights, these being dealt with in general antidiscrimination legislation. Thus, SA does not have the necessary frameworks to monitor, intervene, enable and provide justice for PWD (Sibanda 2015). This has become more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in SA in March 2020. Much information has been gathered on how South Africans generally are experiencing the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, but this does not gather the experiences and circumstances of PWD. Some COVID-19 studies relating to this population focus on specific impairments, on selected locations, or on particular challenges such as communication or mobility, but there is no countrywide data. A current international survey has recruited less than 50 PWDs in SA (Global Disability Rights Monitor 2020). Uniquely, we will do a national survey with people with all types of impairment, aiming to identify experiences and challenges PWD face during COVID-19. We will explore whether the SA National Disaster Management Act is seen to be compliant with the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2017) and South Africa's WPRD. We will produce new comprehensive data revealing impacts of COVID-19 on PWDs and thus provide the Ministry of Women, Youth and PWD (MWYPD) with evidence to inform the development of a monitoring framework for the inclusion of PWD in mitigations during and after pandemics, shocks and crises.  This study will investigate the experiences of people with diverse impairments (PWD) during COVID-19 and hear their perspectives on what could be improved, revealing whether they feel their human rights have been upheld or denied during this time of uncertainty. These findings will then be used to mobilise/influence the SA government to address any rights-based concerns and exclusionary oversights across sectors. It will provide evidence and recommendations to inform the development of a framework (already recognised and documented as needed by MWYPD) to ensure the realisation of the rights of people with disabilities during future national disasters, shocks and crises such as pandemics and similar. After initially reviewing relevant literature, we will refine our survey tool and conduct the first national disability survey asking PWD for their views, with a sample size of approximately 4000 PWDs in South Africa. Mobile phone and online platforms (ICT) will be used to administer remotely, an electronic quantitative and qualitative survey, adhering to COVID-19 lockdown regulations. IDS and HSRC will work in partnership with member organisations, affiliates and partners of the National Council of and for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) to design the survey and recruit participants. We will ensure that a wide cross-section of this subpopulation is reached (balancing disability type, race, class, gender, age), respondents being adults with disabilities (or parents and caregivers) who volunteer to participate. Personal information will be protected as per the Protection of Personal Information Act (2013). The 9-month study is unique in focussing specifically on the perceptions of South African PWDs and their concerns during COVID-19  and related events and then lobbying for their recommendations to inform a new framework to guide improved disability inclusive practices generally and in future crises. Findings will be shared nationally, regionally and globally to a range of formats (verbal and written), for various including disability interested audiences, activists, academics, service planners and policymakers","9, 10","9b, 10a"

C15304,The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at The Jackson Laboratory,"Abstract  To date, most of the research using mouse models for COVID-19 has been done using a transgenic  mouse model expressing high levels of the human ACE2gene driven by the Keratin-18(K18) promoter.  While this model has been extremely useful, it has some notable limitations: disease progression is  rapid and invariably fatal within one week, with an uncharacteristically high infection rate in the brain.  These features restrict its use to study the biology related to the acute phase of the infection, leaving a  gap in models that more accurately reflect the expression patterns and levels of the ACE2 receptor, and  that extend the disease course beyond the acute phase of infection.  We will employ a refined genetic strategy utilizing a recently published knock-in model of the human  ACE2 cDNA into the mouse Ace2 locus. By crossing these hACE2 knock-in mice with inbred  Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains, and by characterizing the response of resulting humanized  F1 progeny to live SARS-CoV-2 infection through an established partnership with researchers at the  Trudeau Institute, we will test the hypothesis that clinical variation in COVID-19 patient response can  be more accurately modelled and phenotypically characterized in mice with naturally regulated ACE2  expression on variable genetic backgrounds.  Consistent with the aims of MMRRC parent grant to identify and distribute mouse models to the  biomedical community, this proposal aims to rapidly provide the research community with an urgently  needed resource for linking the variability in COVID-19 disease outcome with underlying host genetic  features, and for developing precision models for post infection sequelae.","1, 4","1e, 4d"
P23401,"Endemicity, care and gender: towards developing resilience in Malaysia'Äôs essential care workforce and infrastructure","The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control it have threatened livelihoods, introduced new workplace risks and made unstable work relationships even more precarious, especially for women. This project will study the experience of women performing paid and unpaid work during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the effectiveness and relevance of policies that govern their working conditions during the pandemic.     It will examine the burden of care work (both formal and informal, paid and unpaid) across Malaysia and consider social identifiers using an intersectional lens. These identifiers include ethnicity, gender and class across a spectrum of essential care workers residing in various household and familial configurations. The data generated will be participatory, guided by feminist research principles and collected through in-depth interviews, quantitative surveys, focus group discussions and policy assessments. This work will enhance the capacity of community-based researchers in conducting, analyzing and interpreting research for use in policy processes. In addition, engagement with key government stakeholders will increase their understanding of the gendered impact of COVID-19 on the care sector and equip them with evidence-based policy options on how to ensure resilience and sustainability of the care sector in times of crisis.

C20454,RiseTx: A distance-based intervention for reducing sedentary behaviour among prostate cancer survivors,"Mounting evidence also suggests that extended bouts of sitting has deleterious associations with health outcomes in cancer survivors independent of physical activity. Cancer and its treatment together with the threat of COVID-19, has contributed to additional stress levels experienced by prostate cancer survivors. Therefore, supportive care interventions adapted to the pandemic among prostate cancer survivors are needed. Building on our successful pilot study, we will evaluate the effects of a 12-week intervention using wearable technology + behavioural counselling vs. wearable technology alone (control group) in reducing sitting time and increasing physical activity in prostate cancer survivors. We now propose an efficacy trial of RiseTx with some modifications to address the maintenance of the behaviour change we observed in the initial pilot. Maintenance of behaviour change was not a focus in the previous trial. As such, all components of the previous intervention including the RiseTx application and wearable activity tracker will be retained and we will provide additional behavioural support through videoconferencing to maintain behaviour change, which is an extension of our prior work. The intervention will consist of five phases consisting of behavioural counselling (e.g., goal setting, action planning) and daily step goals of 3000 (i.e., using an activity monitor; Fitbits) over the average of their baseline week at the end of 12 weeks. Prostate cancer survivors in the control group will receive Fitbits only with no further resources. This intervention has high potential for broad reach as it can ultimately be delivered through internet- and mobile-based applications. With internet usage growing fastest among older Canadians, our study will create a unique distance-based platform that could be scaled for use by clinical and community-based organizations as a low-cost, supportive care tool to improve quality of life for all cancer survivors.",10,10a

P21170,Serologic and Molecular Studies of human anti-hCoV antibody cross-immunity and protective responses among endemic HCoVs and SARS-CoV2,"Project Summary The emergence of the novel human betacoronavirus SARS-CoV2 in Wuhan, China in 2019 has rapidly evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Over a 100 million people have been infected and there have been several million deaths. There is also great disparity in the manner in which COVID-19 illness presents, from asymptomatic infection to death. COVID-19 illness in children is overall more mild or asymptomatic compared to adults. One hypothesis that may explain this disparity is that children have cross-immunity to SARS-CoV2 due to frequent early exposure to globally circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cause a milder respiratory illness. Whether there is some level of cross-immunity between the endemic HCoVs and SARS-CoV2 that carries into adulthood and can provide some level of protection from COVID-19 disease is the subject of this R01 application. Our primary goal is to provide serologic and molecular evidence of anti-HCoV/SARS-CoV2 spike (S) cross- reactive and neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against SARS-CoV2 in vivo. We have an IRB- approved protocol to collect blood samples on 250 COVID-19 individuals. Our COVID cohort is comprised of 5 groups that includes adult and pediatric cancer patients, adult and pediatric healthcare providers and adults without COVID patient contact. In addition, we will study our pre-pandemic seasonal influenza cohort for evidence of pre-existing anti-SARS-CoV2 S Abs. In Aim 1 we will quantify the present of anti-S HCoV antibodies and quantitate their cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV2 S. The studies in subaim 1A will include FACS staining of S expressing cells and ELISAs of S subdomains for epitope mapping. In subaim 1B, selected plasma samples within each study group will be used for affinity column purification of plasma IgGs that will be passaged over and eluted from one of 4 HCoV or SARS-CoV2 spike columns and tested for cross-binding, cross-Fc effector activity and cross-neutralization activity. In subaim 1C, these purified IgGs will be tested in vivo in hACE2 mice for cross-protection against SARS-CoV2 challenge. In Aim 2 we will establish the molecular basis by which bi- directional immunity to among CoVs could provide cross immunity to HCoVs and SARS-CoV2 through common spike epitope recognition. In subaim 2A, we will perform memory B (mB) cell screening for presence of S cross- binding. Single mB cells that bind at least one hCoV S protein and SARS-CoV2 S will be isolated by FACS, their cognate VH/VL genes cloned, expressed as whole IgG1 mAbs and tested for cross-binding, virus neutralization and Fc effector activity against the different HoCoVs, SARS and SARS-CoV2. In subaim 2B, mAbs with cross- CoV activity will be tested in mouse and hamster models for protection against SARS-CoV2 challenge. In subaim 2C, we will adapt the novel LibraSeq technique to capture the single or multi-spike binding specificity, BCR repertoires and transcriptomes of selected Bm cells to study the potential different evolutionary origins that may exist between mono-spike and multi-spike binding cells. This R01 grant will provide proof-of-principle molecular studies of HCoV/SARS-CoV2 Ab cross-immunity that may aid in COVID-19 vaccine design.","1, 3","1d, 1e, 3d"

In Maryland, where 60% of the population is white and 30% is black, the rate ofcoronavirus infections is higher among African Americans (AA) at 49.4% compared to 36.9%among whites, and 13.7% among Asians and among other races (MD Department of Health,2020). Likewise, AAs account for 53% of COVID-19 deaths within Baltimore's Northeastcommunity (i.e. zip code 21215), and, in one of Baltimore's Health Enterprise Zones (HEZ) (i.e.,21216, 21217, 21223, and 21229) four of five infected residents are black (David, P., 2020). Low-income underinsured/uninsured AAs with COVID-19 symptoms often experience transportationbarriers. Even when they are able to arrive at an emergency room (ER) they often are turned away(Shamus, K., 2020). Other members of this population elect not to go to the ER and instead dealwith the painful COVID-19 symptoms at home. To make matters worse, the long history ofsegregation nationwide has forced many AAs into housing areas with limited access to local healthclinics, healthy food options, clean air, and green space, all of which contribute to higherincidences of pre-existing illnesses, which increases the risk of experiencing more severe COVID-19 symptoms.To address the aforementioned problems, the Morgan State University (MSU) School ofArchitecture and Planning (MSU-SAP), MSU Department of Psychology, MSU Department ofGeography, AA biomedical company Juxtopia, University of Maryland, and engineeringconsulting company Contronic LLC, will investigate an innovative concept of rapidly renovatingBaltimore's vacant/underused houses/buildings, located in lower-income Baltimore HEZcommunities and zip code 21215, into temporary clinics. The goal of the project is to provide targetresidents with easier accessibility to culturally aware and competent healthcare services (i.e.,local/community healthcare facilities and resources (i.e., healthcare providers)) to measurablydecrease the health disparity in COVID-19 related infections and mortality rates inBaltimore. The MSU-SAP team hypothesis is that IF some Baltimore City-ownedvacant/underused properties in HEZ and 21215 communities are renovated into hybrid clinics,THEN residents in those communities will have access to efficient and more culturallycompetent healthcare services compared to traditional healthcare facilities (e.g., ERs). Toaccomplish this research, the investigators will address the following specific aims:Aim 1: Assess the impact of the clinic-desert phenomenon on the COVID-19 outbreak inBaltimoreAim 2: Develop a methodology to identify optimal locations for potential temporary communityclinics for testing, vaccination and other related healthcare services during outbreaks andpandemics such as COVID-19Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of converting a vacant or underused building into a temporarycommunity health clinic during times of public health crisis, such as COVID-19",11,11a

However, the major challenge of this technology is the extreme sensitivity and the very low cellular uptake of the gene material that triggers the hosts' immune response, which hampers their potential. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a synthetic platform for the rapid screening of peptide amphiphiles with potential as gene delivery vehicles.  approach allowed the identification of a candidate with a remarkable (one order of magnitude in vitro) improvement in delivery efficiency and cellular toxicity compared to typical commercial reagents. Remarkably, this candidate has also recently proven highly active for in vivo delivery of mRNA in mice, which suggests that it can be an excellent non-viral vector for the formulation of mRNA vaccines with a boosted potency, due to the uptake enhancement provided by this conceptually-new delivery vector.",7,7a
C02346,A mixed methods evaluation of remote home monitoring models during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK,"Delays in the escalation of patient cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the admittance of patients with advanced course of the disease, requiring invasive treatment and potential admission to ICU. Remote home monitoring models (sometimes referred to as 'virtual wards') seek to remotely monitor patients considered high-risk of deterioration at home to: 1) avoid unnecessary hospital admissions (appropriate care at the appropriate place), and 2) escalate cases of deterioration at an earlier stage to avoid invasive ventilation and ICU admission. Remote home monitoring models have been implemented in the US, Australia, Greece and UK, with some variation in the frequency of patient monitoring, modality (telephone or video calls and use of applications or online portals), patient criteria and use of pulse oximetry (Margolius et al. 2020; Karampela et al. 2020; Thornton 2020; Hutchings et al. 2020; Kricke et al. 2020; Annis et al. 2020; O'Keefe et al. 2020; Ford et al. 2020). In the UK, at least 10 remote home monitoring models have been documented with the aim outlined above (this does not include models operating as a step-down service following hospital inpatient stay). These models have mainly involved the following processes: 1) patient triage through 111, GP practice, hot hub (or ED for those pilots in secondary care), 2) patient provided with pulse oximeter, patient information (including escalation warning signs and what to do) and mechanism for recording observations regularly (app or paper diary) (potential observations being symptoms, pulse, heart rate, temperature, O2)., 3) patient receives regular monitoring calls from staff (either primary or secondary care depending on pilot). Symptoms and trends of O2 saturations are monitored. Modality/frequency of surveillance at clinician discretion. Calls are used to identify cases of deterioration and inform patient of next steps, and 4) Patients expected to 'check out' around 14 days mark (when recovery expected) - follow up to check symptoms and have oximeter and diary returned. Despite previous research on the use of remote home monitoring models for other conditions, there is a lack of studies on the implementation of these models for remote home monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. This mixed-methods evaluation of remote home monitoring models in the UK will seek to address this gap in two phases: (i) by capturing the lessons learnt during the implementation of these models during wave 1 of the pandemic and (ii) evaluating the implementation of the models during wave 2. The protocol has been developed during a four-week scoping exercise which has included initial scope of the literature (see appendix 2), discussions with each of the proposed sites (n=11), documentary analysis, and discussions with colleagues at PHE and NHSE. From discussions with a team from Imperial, our understanding is that they will be analysing retrospective data from sites operating during wave 1 of the pandemic provided to them by NHS Digital; therefore we are not proposing a quantitative analysis of outcomes in phase 1.",4,4c
P23503,Quartz On-chip for Virus Detection,"The global-scale pandemic crisis of COVID-19 requires precise and immediate technological solutions for virological and serological  diagnosis tests. These tests must be accurate, rapid, intelligent, and cost-efficient to prevent future rebounds of infections and help  control the pandemic. In this context, the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) industry, especially piezoelectric resonators of all  shapes and sizes, is a promising strategy to revolutionize the biological detection market. Ultrahigh sensitive nanomechanical  resonators showed the potential of this technology for mass loading. Unfortunately, applying MEMS to the biomedical sector requires  challenging qualities, making it often unattainable to material scientists and engineers. QOVID offers a solution to fill this gap  between MEMS and biomedicine by developing a commercialization solution for piezoelectric Œ±-quartz resonating devices to detect  the mass response of SARS-CoV-2 spike molecular interactions as an original readout of viral loads. QOVID builds on the technology  developed during the ERC Starting Grant SENSiSOFT to provide a user-friendly versatile Bio-MEMS sensor prototype that will give  researchers in the life sciences and biomedical sector without an engineering or electronic training a reliable diagnostic tool to detect  SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.  QOVID will scale up a new generation of On-chip epitaxial piezoelectric Œ±-quartz/Si MEMS manufactured exclusively by soft-chemistry  with CMOS-compatible processes offering cost-efficient single-chip solutions not only for biomedical applications but also for many  other fields. These Œ±-quartz bioMEMS will have thicknesses between 200 nm and 1 ¬µm, this is between 10 to 50 times thinner and 10  to 100 times more sensitive than those obtained by traditional top-down technologies on bulk crystals.  QOVID will pursue commercialization and market solutions both within academia and the biotechnology and biomedical among other sectors.",1,1a

C00239,Development of a test to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteases  (Cov2-PIs project),"SARS-CoV-2 proteases are essential to the life cycle of the virus and are highly conserved in the beta-coronavirus family. This is how the Cov2-Pls-project researchers will develop a high-throughput screening system to identify inhibitors that can effectively block the action of SARS-CoV-2 proteases, and thus stop the proliferation of the virus. The molecules identified could help develop, ultimately, effective drugs to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and limit its impact on public health and the global economy.",6,6a
C06893,"Molecular Basis of Cancer Virus Replication, Transformation, and Innate Defense","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its causative agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are currently a most pressing health concern. Much more needs to be learned about the pathology of the virus, as well as the host response to viral infection. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the final state of severe COVID-19, is caused by the uncontrollable immune response of the host, so called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). What predisposes some patients to progress to severe COVID-19 is not known, but certain populations - such as the elderly and cancer patients - are at higher risk. Therefore, we are investigating whether host microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis. Since miRNAs regulate virtually every cellular process, and are often dysregulated during disease, including viral infections, it is highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts miRNA levels. Aberrant miRNA profiles during viral infection are known to be caused both by host responses to counteract the infecting agent and by deliberate actions of the virus, usually to dampen the immune system Our group has contributed significantly to the realization that some herpesviral transcripts selectively bind host miRNAs and induce their degradation in a process known as target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD). Such selective miRNA degradation is beneficial for the virus, as exemplified by decreased levels of host miR 27a causing prolonged T cell activation that aids oncogenic transformation by herpesvirus saimiri. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 selectively affects the miRNAs that regulate crucial cytokines, as many miRNAs are known to regulate immune factors involved in antiviral defense. One of these is a key player during severe COVID19: interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is regulated by miR-146a, miR-142-3p and let-7. Documenting the dysregulation of particular miRNAs during infection by SARS-CoV-2 can therefore have therapeutic potential, as well as providing biomarkers for COVID progression. We will use state-of-the art small RNA sequencing, as well as RNA detection by TaqMan reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to investigate miRNA populations at various times after infection of several lung cell lines with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we are employing custom bioinformatic predictions to search for viral transcripts that could selectively regulate host miRNAs and have already identified several potential candidates. Providing fundamental insights into the biology of SARS-CoV-2 as regards these important host noncoding RNAs will be important for mankind's ability to manage both the current and future pandemics.","1, 4","1b, 4a"
C19739,Laying the groundwork for improved psychological preparedness and adaptation of Canadian nurses working during healthcare crises:  Simulated training to improve resiliency of nursing groups (STRONG),"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on Canadian nurses. Succeeding waves have led to increased levels of depression, anxiety, traumatic symptoms, and burnout among nurses. Staff shortages are now being reported as nurses change units, change workplaces or leave the profession. However, anecdotal reports suggest that enrollment in Canadian nursing programs is higher than it was pre-pandemic. Previous research has shown that new nursing graduates are especially vulnerable to leaving the profession within the first two years following graduation; being thrust into the pandemic working conditions may exacerbate an exodus of these novice nurses. Interviews conducted by our team in the spring of 2020 and 2021 suggest that nurses working in hospitals did not feel prepared to face the mental, social, and physical challenges of working under pandemic conditions. The goal of this project is to create and pilot a training program that will prepare nursing students to work during this pandemic and/or other extreme healthcare crises. The program will consist of 10 training modules combining online content and in-person practice; topics may include trauma, burnout, moral distress, self-care and resiliency, working with racialized patients during COVID, and stigma. Content will be reviewed both by mental health experts, nursing students, and nurses currently working in the field to ensure that it is appropriate to the needs of nurses working under extreme healthcare crises. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to determine the impact of the program on self-efficacy, resiliency, confidence, and knowledge of mental health/coping strategies. The program will also be piloted at partner sites to ensure its utility and applicability across nursing programs. The goal will be to make training materials available to other nursing programs across Canada, and eventually develop online modules for nurses who did not receive this training while in university.","10, 11","10a, 11f"
C10685,Strengthening Pandemic Preparedness in Long-Term Care,"Our Implementation Science Team is partnering with six long-term care and retirement home units in Saskatchewan, Ontario, and New Brunswick to support the reintegration of family caregivers. Furthermore, our team is also supporting the reintegration of other informal caregivers who play an important social role for residents who have no or less involved family caregivers. Using a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial, we will compare outcomes from three of the units that will focus on the reintegration of family caregivers alone and outcomes from the remaining three units that will focus on the reintegration of both family and other informal caregivers. Components of the intervention will include the identification of caregivers and a point of contact for caregivers, development of a consistent screening process and safety protocols for caregivers, establishment of a rapid appeals process, pre-entry preparation of caregivers through supportive education, and staff education to understand the essential roles of caregivers. Resident, caregiver, and staff outcomes related to loneliness, social support, resilience, and burnout will be measured before, during, and after the implementation of the interventions.",10,10b
C03821,In vivo PET imaging of novel engineered AAVs informs capsid design,"Abstract of: Proposed COVID-19-related supplement to In vivo PET imaging of novel engineered AAVs informs capsid designThere is an urgent need to develop tools to assess viral pathogenesis and the efficacy of potential therapeuticsfor novel viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. While organoid and cell-based assays have been broadly used toassess the candidate receptor of such viruses, these assays cannot answer key questions as to: 1) whethermultiple receptors for the virus exist, 2) the in vivo receptor affinity of the virus and accumulation within theupper respiratory tract, 3) transport of the virus into the vascular system and ultimately to the heart andkidneys, and 4) the resulting transfection of these various sites. Our laboratory has previous developedmethods to label adeno-associated viruses and track their transport following systemic injection. We foundthat these engineered viruses carry cargo attached to the capsid across the blood brain barrier and the cargoaccumulates deep within the brain. Combined optical and PET studies have suggested that binding of thevirus to its receptor results in transcytosis of the intact capsid. We hypothesize that coronaviruses maypossess similar capabilities to be transported across the lung epithelium. We plan to address key issues byassessing receptor binding and transduction using PET and optical imaging. Our resulting specific aims are thefollowing: 1) development and validation of tagging strategies to image pseudotype viral particles at BSL2, 2)development and validation of reporter gene strategies to image transduction of engineered viruses, and 3)application and dissemination of these dual strategies to assess viral transport, transduction and susceptibilityto available therapies including a) antibodies, b) protease inhibitors, and c) fusion inhibitors. We propose to develop and image engineered viruses expressing the spike protein and a reporter gene and track theseviruses within a model of lung fibrosis and a mouse model with a humanized ACE2 receptor. We will leveragethe capabilities to label and track viral capsids and transduction developed within this R01 and key capabilitiesof Stanford University. Pseudotype viruses based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and lentivirus have beendeveloped with spike proteins corresponding to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV2. Further, replicons with intact viralproteases have been engineered. We propose to collaborate with those developing and testing engineeredviruses and therapeutics at Stanford, including Jan Carette and Catherine Blish in addition to the key personnelon our parent project. At the conclusion of each phase of this project, we will disseminate strategies for theincorporation of a PET tag, a reporter gene, and dual PET imaging protocols. We hypothesize that these toolscan be disseminated and rapidly modified to assess both SARS-CoV-2 and future viruses. We will make ourtechnology available through commercial and scientific partners.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
P22396,Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),"Project Summary  In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses  (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses  within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction  and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great  concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas.  Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species  harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown.  Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and  global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health  structures in Venezuela.   The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-  NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling  approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known  arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics,  map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within  these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other  vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these  samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine  learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on  prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing  human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a  particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity.  We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human  and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.   Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health  agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence  into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity  to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential  to avert full-blown emergence.","1, 2, 3","1d, 2a, 3a, 3d"
C19755,Mental Health of Black Youth after the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has killed many people in Canada and around the world. To stop the spread of the disease, the Government of Canada implemented several preventative measures, including physical distancing. While these measures helped contain the spread of the disease months after its outbreak, the pandemic will have a long-lasting effect on  mental health of the youth. The pandemic poses a ""double whammy"" for Black youth, as they are at increased risk of mental health problems and Black Canadians are at an increased risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. However, race-based data on the mental health of Black youth in Canada during or after the COVID-19 pandemic are not readily available. Our proposed work seeks to examine the mental health of Black youth after the COVID-19 pandemic and offer interventions to address mental health risks in this demographic. This project will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will involve up to 30 interviews with Black youths to determine how the pandemic has affected their mental health. Phase 2 will involve a survey of Black youths in Canada. We will develop documentary videos, policy briefs, and webinars based on our findings. Our research will provide much-needed data on reducing the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black youth. Our team has complementary expertise in Black people's health, youth mental health, quantitative methods, qualitative, and participatory action research. Members of the team and partners are well engaged with the Black community.",10,10a
C00113,LabAnywhere: Technology for Detection of Coronavirus in Remote Settings,"The COVID-19 disease is caused by a virus. Since the symptoms of the COVID-19 disease are similar to many other illnesses, accurate detection and correct identification of the virus in a patient is important to know whether or not the patient is suffering from COVID-19 versus another disease. The current gold-standard detection uses sophisticated molecular biology that must be done in a laboratory by trained technicians. Our research team has developed LabAnywhere, a system intended for rugged use in agriculture. Its called LabAnywhere because it is designed for use in a barn or farm field where there may not be any clean enclosed space to do complex sample handling. The viruses are different in veterinary medicine, but with some modifications, the technology can be applied to human diseases in remote settings.   The proposed research will piggyback upon existing projects. The research team; a design engineer, along with experts in medical biophysics, protein chemistry, and veterinary diseases have been testing a pen-side system for the livestock industries. The design is a simple, easy to deploy handheld system for a molecular biologic assay where there is no laboratory available, such as on a ship at sea or in a remote community many days travel from a laboratory. The project will use easily handled, safe viruses from the animal world for initial testing to validate the methods, then move to tests using human viruses once initial trials are complete.",1,"1a, 1c"
C20540,SARS-CoV-2 Spike conformation: impact on Fc-mediated effector functions,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of the ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is highly contagious and has infected more than 125 million people worldwide and caused over 2.75 million deaths since its discovery. The type, dynamics and persistence of protective immune responses in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is currently under scrupulous investigation. The viral target of this response is the highly immunogenic trimeric Spike (S) glycoprotein, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The antiviral activities of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies goes beyond their neutralizing activities and include Fc-mediated effector functions. Unfortunately, these antibody functions remain relatively understudied compared to their neutralizing activities. Why is it important to better understand Fc-mediated effector functions? The main reason is that they represent attractive targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccine development. The work proposed here will provide a better understanding of the S glycoprotein conformation and its impact in Fc-mediated effector functions. Improved knowledge of these responses will be critical to expand our current understanding of the conformational landscape of the S glycoprotein and thus has the potential to identify new vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. ",1,1b
C07359,The impact of COVID-19 related school closures on foundation skills in reception children.,"When primary school children return in the Autumn, they will have missed more than a term of usual school provision. The disruption may exacerbate existing inequalities in academic attainment, and potentially create new ones. This project focuses on the impact of school closures on pupils who are at the important transition point between reception and Year 1. In reception, through adult-led instruction, children learn literacy, maths, and language skills that provide the foundation for later academic success. Instruction during the school closure period has varied considerably and inequalities in children's learning experiences during the COVID-19 school closures are evident. These include disparities in the support and resources provided by schools (more active forms of support in advantaged areas), access to technology and study space (more limited for disadvantaged families), and the extent to which parents have been able to support their children. Teachers have reported IT problems, difficulty providing usual standards of teaching remotely, and lower engagement in less advantaged children. As a consequence children are now likely to be on different developmental pathways. For some, progress may have maintained or even accelerated, but for others, progress may have stalled and previously learned skills may have been lost.  We urgently need to be able to identify those children whose learning has been most affected by school closures and to better understand the factors that predict poor rates of progress. The usual end of reception EYFS profile has not been completed for this cohort, leaving Year 1 practitioners with limited information to inform support decisions. It is vital that these data are collected as soon as possible. If pupils are unable to recover their rates of learning and secure the foundation skills needed for accessing the school curriculum, then the consequences for their long-term educational outcomes are potentially very serious. In order to provide more differentiated forms of support remotely, in the event of future closures, schools need knowledge of who is likely to be at risk of experiencing the greatest disruption to their learning.  Using data collected by schools before closures, at the start of the Autumn term and later in the spring term, we will investigate the factors that have moderated and mediated pupil progress in the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP) goals and reading levels. A large, superdiverse city will serve as the research site to ensure that findings can be generalised to the national context. The data will immediately benefit schools in deciding how to allocate catch-up support. We will convey project findings to policy makers and third sector organisations to inform national strategies aimed at remediating the negative impacts of lockdown post-COVID-19 and addressing inequalities in the event of future school closures.",10,10b
C13778,Evaluating the durability and cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 immunity elicited by COVID-19 vaccines,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has advanced rapidly from initial clinical observations in late 2019 to a global pandemic.  Safe and effective vaccines offer our best opportunity to control spread of infection, but limited availability of vaccine doses and rapid emergence of viral variants of concern that may evade vaccine-elicited immunity are major concerns in Canada and globally.  ""Partial"" immunity elicited by one dose of vaccine may not protect some individuals, such as elderly adults, from infection by these new viral strains; however, we have an incomplete understanding of immune factors that may help to identify individuals or populations that remain at higher risk despite receiving the vaccine.  Our project will compare the immune response in younger and older adults following one and two doses of COVID-19 vaccine.  We will characterize the diversity of antibody-producing B cells generated following vaccination and link genetic features of these cells to each individual's ability to neutralize viral variants of concern.  Our results will provide new information about vaccine-elicited immune responses and inform ongoing efforts to protect the most vulnerable members of our population.","1, 7","1d, 7l"
C15156,Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future infectious agents,"PROJECT SUMMARY  An overarching goal of the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU-  MMRRC) is to optimize and refine mouse models so that biomedical research using these models can proceed  rapidly and effectively. The MU-MMRRC also conducts resource-related research, often collaboratively, to  further refine and develop mutant mice and capitalize on the power of mouse genetics and associated microbiota  for biomedical research. This proposal enhances the capacity of the MU MMRRC to further characterize and  refine mouse models through characterization of biological material and enhance our capability to examine the  role of infectious disease and the gut microbiome. In the immediate future this equipment will enhance our  ongoing and proposed studies of COVID-19. As part of previous supplemental funding, the MU-MMRRC has  succeeded in advancing this mouse strain as a model for human COVID-19, characterizing viral growth and the  development of acute disease following intranasal and aerosol infection of mice with variations in gut microbiota and  prior infection, recapitulating the disease in humans. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge from human samples  the K18-hACE2 mouse will play a key role in evaluating pathogenesis and escape of immunity. As of May of 2021,  there have been nearly 32 million survivors of COVID-19 in the United States. As an acute local and systemic  inflammatory response is known to cause long-term post-infectious diseases such as chronic pulmonary and  neurological diseases, the equipment requested for supplement funding will permit the MU-MMRRC an ability to  further characterize and refine the mouse model for the benefit of short- and long-term biomedical research. In  addition, this equipment will help the MU-MMRRC expand its ability to phenotype other mouse models in line with its  long-term research goals of characterizing and optimizing mouse models by examining the effects of differing  microbiota. Current equipment available for use in the BSL3 and ABSL3 laboratories is limited across the nation,  effectively slowing COVID-19 research during this pandemic. Expanding the capacity of the BSL3 equipment  resources available to analyze infected samples will allow the MU-MMRRC to continue to play a critical role in the  biomedical research community and promote studies of pathogenesis for COVID-19. The objective of this proposal is  therefore to provide several key pieces of equipment that are expected to be of use not only to COVID-19 researchers,  but also provide flexibility to other researchers in the region and nation for studying disease pathogenesis in mouse  BSL3 models. The resulting expansion of capabilities will be critical to research on these devastating diseases and  on mouse models in general. Crucially, this equipment has use far beyond the pandemic and has been specifically  chosen to enhance the parent grant's research goals during this funding cycle and into future funding cycles.  .",1,1e
C04305,"Portable, Low-cost Hardware for De-centralized COVID-19 Diagnostics for Canada, Colombia and Ecuador","Here we propose to develop and demonstrate the hardware and molecular tools needed for high-capacity de-centralized COVID-19 diagnostics in Canada, Colombia and Ecuador.     We will do this by adapting our portable plate reader, called PLUM, for distributed deployment of two key diagnostic modalities using our patient validated tests.   1) A rapid molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic (RT-LAMP, 15 min) to prevent a resurgence of infection as our communities begin to reduce lockdown restrictions.   2) Serological testing to determine population antibody-levels and allow for strategic use of precious, future vaccine stocks.     To bring these diagnostics assays (96 or 384 well plate) out of the laboratory setting and to the point-of-need, we will adapt the PLUM reader to provide the high-temperature incubation (65 C) needed for RT-LAMP. PLUM will also be augmented with purpose-built software and training materials to enable the use of diagnostics by users in the field (e.g. health care workers). This will include automated software for guidance on sample collection, running the assays, data analysis and secure data sharing to public health networks. The RT-LAMP assay, which has already been extensively tested with SARS-CoV-2 patient samples, will be augmented with new safeguard features to prevent false negative results and adapted to allow for RNA extraction-free use.     The COVID-19 serological assay has also already been extensively validated with SARS-CoV-2 patient samples and here will be optimized for use in PLUM. Implementation and testing of this de-centralized diagnostic capacity will be performed at small businesses in Canada, and with hospital workers and remote populations in Colombia and Ecuador. Taken together, this proposed project combines a strong technical solutions with patient trials outside of conventional laboratory settings and will enable the development of the crucial de-centralized COVID-19 testing capacity needed for recovery from the pandemic.",1,1a
P23317,Strengthening access to sexual and reproductive health services for internally displaced people during COVID-19 in Burkina Faso,"Refugee and displaced populations, and the vulnerable communities with whom they share space, are at high risk for acquiring COVID-19 because their living conditions make it impossible to practice physical distancing and isolation or to access quality healthcare. Refugee women are particularly vulnerable because their limited access to sexual and reproductive health services and products is further interrupted and their duties as caretakers, especially in under-resourced refugee settings, are increased.     This project is part of an initiative that will provide evidence and strengthen capacity for bridging the knowledge gap in responding to the growing COVID-19 health crisis in the short-term and the longer term. The initiative will support research on resilience building and preparedness to serve the needs of refugees and other populations on the move by promoting inter-sectoral approaches, including building bridges between humanitarian and development responses to reduce and control health risks for displaced populations. It will also leverage existing local opportunities to strengthen the overall initiative.    This project will assess and respond to the needs of an internally displaced population in the fragile context of Burkina Faso, where growing conflict and terrorism may turn into a chronic development crisis. It focuses on increasing access to sexual and reproductive health services and related rights of internally displaced adolescents and women in the context of COVID-19. Firstly, it will identify the needs, constraints, and facilitating factors for using such services before developing and implementing an intervention to improve access to and awareness of sexual and reproductive health services and rights.

C03619,CovidNor - Experiences of patients and primary health care professionals during the COVID-19 epidemic in Norway,"Current research on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have been mainly based on hospitalized patients. However, most infections are not severe and a majority of COVID-19 patients are diagnosed and handled in primary care.  The overall project objective is to understand the clinical picture of early, mild to moderate forms of the disease and  fears and experience of safeguarding among people personally affected by COVID-19 outside hospitals, as well as the response of the local medical teams in primary health care and the supporting health care system response including infection prevention and control.    Through a web-based survey, we will invite people in isolation/quarantine at home to report symptoms and personal experiences and emotions throughout the course of the illness and/or period in isolation/quarantine. The survey results will be linked to registry follow-up to detect complications and long-term effects of COVID-19. We will invite general practitioners (GPs) to record case information of patients with respiratory tract infections during six weeks of the epidemic to provide clinical information of patients presenting to primary care. In-depth interview studies from a primary care perspective of GPs, leaders of municipal out-of-hours units and municipality chief medical officers will provide  insight into how health care workers in Norwegian and Swedish primary care handle the epidemic. We want to focus in particular on their experiences of the local health care system responses including infection control.    The clinical observational data of cases outside hospitals, both self-reported data and reported by GPs, will provide knowledge of the natural history of mild to moderate COVID-19 cases. This may help clinicians and health authorities in better identifying patients with COVID-19. The interview studies will provide valuable information regarding the infection control response during the epidemic as experienced from primary care and municipalities.","4, 5, 10, 11","4b, 4c, 4d, 5b, 10a, 11a"
C17944,Using data to improve public health: COVID-19 secondment,"Patients' willingness to seek timely medical treatment is instrumental in delivering adequate care. It is one of the National Health Service's (NHS) core missions to improve public health and well-being. Delayed treatment has been associated with higher overall healthcare costs and poor health outcomes. The COVID-19 (C19) pandemic had a profound impact on both the healthcare system as well as on patients. However, the impact of C19 on public willingness to seek timely treatment remains critically understudied. The secondment will be used to shed light on this aspect by analysing fully anonymised patient data within OpenSAFELY. Given the heavily redacted nature of the data, a combination of code lists from OpenCodelists need to be used to illustrate healthcare seeking behaviour. Specifically, healthcare seeking behaviour from patients who suffer from acute pain, as identified by all relevant CTV3 codes, are observed between the time the first national lockdown was introduced and after all restrictions had been lifted. It is hypothesized that medical treatment to alleviate pain was delayed during all national lockdown episodes due to public health interventions that aimed to protect the NHS from collapsing. Similarly, it is assumed that, on average, delayed medical treatment for acute pain patients continue to persist even after all protective public health measures had been lifted. In other words, it is hypothesized that some patients do not seek treatment for pain relief as fast as they would have prior to the pandemic. Mixed method time series modelling is used to estimate the hypothesised increase in delayed treatment. Competing explanations for delayed treatment are tested. Specifically, generalised linear models are used to derive odds ratios for competing explanations (e.g., C19 status). The aim is to identify relevant sociodemographic groups that would benefit from targeted campaigns to increase their tendency to seek timely treatment.",10,10a
C15110,Blocking TMPRSS2 expression for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Summary/Abstract  SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 51 million and is responsible for the death of over 1.27 million people  globally. Interventions to address both prevention and treatment are urgently needed. Infection of SARS-CoV-  2 requires the host serine protease TMPRSS2 to activate the virus spike protein for interaction with the host  ACE2 receptor and entry into host cells. TMPRSS2 levels are significantly regulated by androgen receptor  signaling in prostate cancer cells, but unknown in respiratory epithelial cells. Numerous inhibitors have been  developed to target AR signaling. The toxicity, effective dosage, and side effects of these inhibitors have been  well-documented. We hypothesize that reducing TMPRSS2 levels by blocking AR signaling will block activation  of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory epithelial cells, thereby preventing its entry into host cells in  the respiratory system. Our preliminary data indicate that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of AR signaling  suppresses TMPRSS2 levels, and an AR signaling inhibitor significantly inhibits pseudotype virus infection in  prostate cancer cells. In this proposal, we will examine whether AR signaling inhibitors will suppress TMPRSS2  levels in respiratory epithelial cells leading to inhibition of TMPRSS2-catalyzed proteolysis of the SARS-CoV-2  spike protein in vitro, subsequently mitigating its infection efficiency. Next, we will investigate if targeting  TMPRSS2 levels will inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection through the respiratory route in vivo. In particular, we will  examine the SARS-CoV-2 infection efficiency in mice deficient in TMPRSS2 or androgen production. We will  investigate if AR signaling inhibitors will reduce TMPRSS2 levels in vivo, and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in  respiratory system. The goal of this proposal is to examine TMPRSS2 as a target and identify an effective drug  from currently known AR signaling inhibitors to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is  under development and might be effective, this study will provide a therapeutic treatment option of suppressing  SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host, thus reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and ultimately preventing  deaths from COVID-19.",6,6a

C06216,Development and pilot testing of an m-health intervention to reduce COVID-19 associated psychosocial distress among Nigerian healthcare workers,"The advent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) across the globe has brought severe disproportionate distress on individuals, communities, health resources, and nations. The distress is increasingly eroding the mental health and wellbeing of patients and caregivers in contexts with precariously fragile health resources. Nigeria with all health parameters below the WHO standard is no exception. COVID-19 related distress in Nigeria is rapidly jeopardising the mental health and wellbeing of health workers, especially doctors and nurses who spend relatively more time with patients. Doctors and nurses, hereafter referred to as healthcare workers (HWs), are brutally besieged by long working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, and occupational burnout. Also, the HWs' exposure to the virus is exponentially increasing while some of the control measures, like social distancing, imposed by the government are depleting their social capital and social connectedness, further undermining their mental health and wellbeing. However, m-health intervention is increasingly seen by some experts as a game-changer in the context of solutions to mental health and wellbeing challenges. Therefore, this project investigates COVID-19 associated psychosocial distress and evaluate the feasibility and pilot-testing of a guided m-health intervention among Nigeria's HWs. The study will use mixed-method to collect data for pilot-testing a guided m-health intervention to reduce Covid-19 associated psychosocial distress among the HWs in selected tertiary hospitals, Southwest Nigeria. The findings of this project would provide useful information on the feasibility of using such intervention for improving the psychosocial health of Nigerian HWs.",10,10a
P22644,Optimizing a Universal Influenza Subunit Nano/Microparticulate Vaccine,"ABSTRACT  The WHO estimates there are approximately 5 million cases of influenza infections annually, with approximately  500,000 deaths occurring globally. The most cost-effective protection against influenza is vaccination.  Unfortunately, due to yearly antigenic shifts and drifts, current seasonal vaccines are ineffective. There is a need  for a better flu vaccine. In order to design a better flu vaccine, we plan on optimizing the immune synapse using  nano/microparticles (MPs) fabricated from the polymer acetalated dextran (Ac-DEX). Our previous data has  shown a dependence of particle degradation and optimal immune response against an influenza antigen. Not  only does the release of the antigen effect the immune response, the release of the adjuvant is also important.  The optimized degradation of both adjuvant and antigen has a drastic change in survival compared to non-  optimized formulations. Our particle system is unique because it relies on the highly tunable polymer Ac-DEX.  Ac-DEX is ideal for delivery of agents to phagocytic cells because it is acid-sensitive and has significantly  increased degradation in the low acid (~pH 5) of the phagosome. In addition to this it has tunable degradation  rates that can range from hours to months, which is a unique range from commonly used polyesters (e.g.  poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)) that have degradation on the order of months. Moreover, Ac-DEX is unique  from polyesters because its degradation products are pH neutral, and do not have the potential to shift the local  pH or damage sensitive payloads. We have three specific aims exploring various optimizations of our particle  system. Aim 1 is focused on formulation of the polymer and particles. The release rate of the adjuvant will be  explored. Ac-DEX polymer with various cyclic acetal coverages will be fabricated to degrade over a broad range  of times. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the effect of loading of a novel influenza antigen either on the surface or  encapsulated into the MPs. We will explore degradation rates on antigen release as well as delivery routes in  determining the optimal delivery of influenza antigens that provide a broad range of protection. In Aim 3 we will  explore our optimized system in protecting ferrets. Ferrets are the ideal large animal model for influenza infection.  Using this model, we will evaluate the vaccine efficacy of our formulation, in comparison to a commercially  available flu vaccine.",7,7i
C19616,Data and equity needed to drive post-pandemic recovery in Canada: a Saskatchewan contribution,"During the first weeks days of the global pandemic, people in Saskatchewan watched COVID-19 make its way to the province. In March 2020, residents watched for daily updates on new infections, cases that required hospitalization-and, ultimately death rates-as we sheltered in place under lockdown, experiencing relatively low rates of infection. As of November 2021, during the Delta-driven fourth wave, Saskatchewan is experiencing the highest cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per capita, the health care system pushed beyond capacity. What explains the COVID-19 trajectory in this region? How will residents remember and recover from this global pandemic and apply its lessons to local circumstances, now and in the future? In particular, how did the pandemic-including policies and practices implemented throughout-impact the province's most vulnerable and how do we build better systems to cushion them in the future?  Co-led by epidemiologist Nazeem Muhajarine and historian of medicine and T1 Canada Research Chair Erika Dyck, this interdisciplinary, bi-university, community-engaged team aims to document, preserve, understand, and communicate the wider impacts of the pandemic on social issues and public health, focusing on four interrelated areas: mental health, substance use, housing precarity, and food insecurity. Through a justice lens, we will examine how the pandemic has affected health disparities in equity-seeking groups and use that knowledge to recommend strategies to 'build back better,' in Saskatchewan and nationally.  This research has immense potential to compel decision-makers to act on their own evidence and apply lessons from the pandemic in rebuilding our systems, programs and services, and community resiliency.

P22966,A Microphysiological Mimicry of Human Lung-Bone Marrow Organ-Organ Crosstalk On-a-Chip,"PROJECT SUMMARY.   Several new viral respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential that threaten global health security  have emerged in the past 20 years. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) comprise 50% of the emerging respiratory viruses and can  cause substantial morbidity and mortality. IAVs can infect a diversity of avian and mammalian species, including  humans, and have the remarkable capacity to evolve and adapt to new hosts. Despite the tremendous progress made in  virology and epidemiology, which subtype or strain of IAV will cause the next outbreak remains unpredictable.  Importantly, there is no clinically simulating, pathophysiologically relevant, and readily available in vitro  multi-organ system for predicting the pathogenicity of emerging and re-emerging influenza viruses in humans.  Recent compelling evidence have revealed opposing roles for two major classes of bone marrow (BM)-produced innate  immune cells in shaping the outcome of IAV infection, with neutrophils offering protection and increase in circulating  monocytes being associated with increased pathology. Thus, selective mobilization of either of these two distinct cell  types in response to pulmonary infection with IAV can indirectly reveal potential pathogenicity of a given viral  strain. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a highly innovative, reductionist, yet advanced and complex,  physiologically relevant in vitro model of influenza infection in humans utilizing Organ-on-Chip technology in order to  predict virulence and infectivity of different IAV strains, by reproducing clinically and in vivo-observed immunological  correlates of infection severity. More specifically, we will engineer a first-in-kind fluidically integrated multi-  organ system that recreates BM-lung axis, using primary human-derived cells, for real-time analysis of  inflammation and leukocyte mobilization in response to influenza challenge. Our central hypothesis is that this  dynamic living microsystem can recapitulate differential immune cell mobilization and tissue pathology in  response to high-pathogenicity vs. low-pathogenicity IAV infections in vitro. To address the hypothesis, we  propose the following specific aims: (1) to engineer a living and hematopoietically active human BM-on-a-Chip and  microfluidically link it to a human Lung Small Airway-on-a-Chip that our team has previously developed and  characterize homeostatic physiology and organ-organ crosstalk; and (3) to challenge the BM-Lung microsystem with  airborne IAVs under rhythmic breathing and reproduce differential leukocyte mobilization and tissue damage in  response to distinctly pathogenic viral strains. Such a novel platform holds great potential in emulating and predicting  pathogenicity of IAVs (e.g., during outbreaks, pandemics or when presence of a highly virulent strain is speculated),  utilizing human cells isolated from desired donor/patient populations, and without needing to adapt the virus for host  (as required for some animal studies). In addition, it can considerably accelerate drug development studies by enabling  personalized drug efficacy testing and identification of new therapeutic targets.",1,"1b, 1e"

P22167,Validating the Flavivirus Envelope Protein as an Antiviral Target,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Dengue virus (DENV) and other flaviviruses are major human pathogens that cause significant disease.  Transmitted by widespread mosquito species, many of these viruses spread rapidly and can have a  devastating impact on public health where prior immunity does not exist. There is thus a significant need for  countermeasures to combat both current and future flavivirus threats. Major limitations in current antivirals  development are the relatively small number of validated antiviral targets, most of which are viral enzymes  (e.g., polymerases, proteases); the low barrier to resistance when direct-acting antivirals are used as  monotherapies; and the narrow spectrum activity of most of these agents (Ã¢Â€Âœone bug, one drugÃ¢Â€Â). New classes  of targets that can mediate broad-spectrum activity against related viruses and that have high barriers to  resistance are particularly needed to combat emerging viruses since we generally lack sufficient time and  resources to develop new drugs on a useful time scale once these viruses pose significant threats.   Small molecules targeting the flavivirus envelope protein, E, have the potential to mimic the humoral  immune response by engaging their target extracellularly and blocking viral entry early in the replication cycle.  We have identified multiple small molecule inhibitor series that bind to the DENV envelope protein, E, and  inhibit E-mediated membrane fusion during viral entry even when only a minority of copies of E on the particle  are inhibitor-bound. These compounds bind in a pocket between domains I and II and inhibit West Nile, Zika,  and Japanese encephalitis viruses due to at least partial conservation of this site. We recently established a  target-based assay and validated its use in the identification of new inhibitors of DENV and Zika E proteins  that bind in the conserved pocket and that have more drug-like properties than our original inhibitors. Building  on this work, we now propose a comprehensive plan to rationally optimize small molecule inhibitors of the  DENV E protein as a potential anti-viral strategy. Towards this end, we will combine modeling and structure-  guided drug design with an efficient screening cascade using complementary target-based biochemical,  cellular and mechanistic assays to enable efficient optimization of two chemically distinct lead series. Our  primary goal in this work is to demonstrate antiviral efficacy in a murine model of DENV infection, thus laying  the foundation for first-in-class direct acting antivirals to treat the growing global threat that DENV poses.","1, 6","1b, 1c, 6a"

P22994,Assessing Flu-specific Humoral Immunity in Human Lung after Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Broadly reactive humoral immune responses to flu protect against viral variants. Murine  data shows that the flu-specific memory B cells (Bmem) in the lung are cross-protective across a number of  influenza strains and are functionally distinct from circulating and lymphoid counterparts. As yet we do not know  if flu-specific Bmem in the human lung are cross-protective and bridging this knowledge gap is important to  design the appropriate vaccine regimens that are universally protective against flu. Flu-specific Bmem in ex vivo  lung tissues are rare and this represents a significant technical hurdle in assaying the flu-specific Bmem response  in human lung tissues. In order to address this technical hurdle, this application seeks to establish a model  system wherein human lung tissue is challenged with influenza virus and maintained viable after this challenge  on an advanced cardiopulmonary modality called Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion or EVLP. We anticipate this model will  allow us to enumerate and analyze the flu-specific Bmem response at scale in ex vivo human lung tissues. We  also anticipate that this model system will allow us to compare binding reactivity to viral variants between flu-  specific Bmem located in lung versus mediastinal lymph node tissues to define where cross-protective immunity  exists in the respiratory tract.","1, ","1b, 1d, 1e"
C06868,"Rural Southern Contexts, COVID-19, and Black Men'Âs Alcohol Misuse","Project Summary/Abstract: The young Black men who are the focus of the proposed Urgent Competitive Revision to R01AA026623 arefrom small towns and rural communities in Georgia, an area of persistent poverty for Black residents thatcoincides with the nation's worst educational, economic, and health disparities by race. Black residentsaccount for more than 50% of Georgia's COVID-19 deaths, despite comprising less than 1/3 of the state'spopulation; the state's rural areas have a death rate 1.5 times that of its large cities. NIAAA reports that alcoholuse has increased since pandemic precautions (e.g., shelter in home, social distancing) have beenimplemented. Among rural Black men, we hypothesize that alcohol use may accelerate the spread of SARSCoV-2. In addition to effects on immune function, alcohol misuse undermines the judgement, self-regulation,and motivation to practice recommended disease mitigation behaviors (e.g., physical distancing, self-quarantine, hand washing). Alcohol misuse also encourages young adults' presence in settings andinteractions in which they may be likely to become infected or to infect others. We also propose to examine thepredictors of alcohol use. Many low-income Black men live below or near the federal poverty level and havefew financial resources, including economic assets to use during a protracted pandemic. Economic hardship isexacerbated by racial discrimination, family stress and conflict, fears of exposure to unsafe working conditionswhen work is available, and the greater likelihood that they, their families, or their friends will be affecteddirectly by SARS Cov-2 infection. Pandemic-related stressors are expected to foster the onset of alcohol useproblems and the amplification of existing problems. Importantly, many men will cope well, avoiding alcoholmisuse by drawing on both personal and social coping resources to deal with stress without alcohol use. Wepropose to conduct 3 remote surveys at 3-month intervals with a subsample (N = 242) of rural Black men froman ongoing study who provided past year, pre-pandemic data for the parent study.

P25385,Placebo-controlled randomised trial of tecovirimat  in non-hospitalised Monkeypox patients (PLATINUM),"This protocol describes a scalable, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial among non-hospitalised adults and children with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox virus disease in the United Kingdom.     Eligibility and randomisation: Patients will be identified following clinical assessment and laboratory confirmation of monkeypox infection as part of usual NHS clinical care. All eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive tecovirimat or matching placebo for 14 days, each to be given in addition to the usual NHS care.    Efficacy outcomes: The primary clinical efficacy endpoint is the time to resolution of active lesions. Secondary efficacy endpoints are time to complete lesion resolution, and the time to negative cultures for monkeypox virus in throat and lesion swabs. For the main analyses, follow-up will be censored at 28 days after randomisation. Additional information on longer term outcomes may be collected through review of medical records or linkage to medical databases such as those managed by NHS Digital and other health care organisations across the UK. Additional assessments may be conducted following the end of the main assessment period of the study (28 days) to assess complete resolution of monkeypox symptoms and other relevant adverse events.    Safety: Serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events of special interest, and reasons for stopping study treatment will be recorded and will be reviewed by medical staff at the Central Coordinating Office. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) to study medication (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis, aplastic anaemia, etc.) will be reported in an expedited fashion.     Data collection: To facilitate patient isolation and infection control, and participation by clinicians and patients, data collection and all other trial procedures are streamlined and focused on those aspects critical to participant safety and the reliability of the study results. Informed consent, randomisation and follow up will be conducted remotely by telephone or video and data will be recorded by electronic methods by participants and trial staff.    Numbers to be randomised:  The rates of clinical and microbiological resolution are uncertain for monkeypox in general, and in particular for the current epidemiological context. Sample size estimates using data on the natural history of Congo Basin clade monkeypox indicate that randomisation of 500 individuals would provide at least 85% power and a two-sided a of 0.05 to detect a 40% improvement in the rate of lesion resolution at day 28 (account for one interim analysis and approximately 10% losses to follow-up).

C07419,Rapid Decontamination System of PPE and Medical Equipment for Reuse using Flexible Non-thermal Plasma Generator,"This project aims to develop a method and procedure for decontaminating mask/respirators using non-thermal plasma for safely reuse. As a respirator is a basic personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect frontline healthcare workers against COVID-19, the chronic, global shortage of N95/N99 masks is one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives from the coronavirus. The reuse of masks may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability, even though most of the masks are considered one-time use. Moreover, a single-use mask is adding to the glut of plastic pollution threatening the health of oceans and marine life, environmentalists warn.    In this project, we are developing a rapid and safe dry decontamination method through adapting the state-of-art plasma technologies and printed electronics. The proposing approach will use the viricidal capability of non-thermal plasmas to decontaminate masks without using biocidal chemicals and remaining any chemical residues. The project will ensure the safe reuse of masks with maintaining structural and functional integrity with the biological and material assessments.    Specific objectives of the project include (1) preparing and validating coronavirus samples; (2) developing a plasma decontamination system; (3) quantifying concentration and distribution of biological samples before and after plasma treatment; (4) measuring the effect of plasma treatment on mask performance; (5) quantifying viral inactivation efficiency; and (6) collating and interpreting results to assess the efficacy, promise, and potential implementation pathway for the concept.

P22684,Yersinia Outer-Membrane-Vesicle Vaccines Against Pneumonic Plague,"SUMMARY   Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, has been responsible for high mortality in several epidemics  throughout human history. Plague has been classified as a re-emerging disease by the World Health  Organization since there are several thousand reported cases of the disease worldwide annually and  multidrug-resistant Y. pestis strains occur in recent years. The plague bacillus has been used as a biological  weapon recorded in human history and is one of the more likely biological threats to be used by terrorists.  Currently, no licensed plague vaccines are available in Western world. Isolation of virulent F1-negative Y.  pestis strains from natural sources and the existence of lcrV polymorphisms in Yersinia may result in Y. pestis  variants that escape protective immunity induced by LcrV and F1 antigens. Therefore, vaccines solely based  upon LcrV and F1 antigens is insufficient to guarantee long-term defense against plague in humans. In order to  overcome the drawbacks of subunit vaccines composed of LcrV and F1 antigens, we propose to use Y.  pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) OMVs as an acellular vaccine against plague: (1) Construct Yptb strains which  robustly produce highly immunogenic self-adjuvanting OMVs carrying an array of Y. pestis protective antigens;  (2) Evaluate protective immunity of OMVs in rodents (mouse and rat). (3) Carefully decipher mechanisms of  immune protection induced by the Yersinia OMVs to provide fundamentals for rational plague vaccine  development. Finally, the success of this project will provide highly effective and safe plague vaccines for  humans.",7,"7a, 7i"
C19583,COVID-19 Variant Supplement - Neutralizing human-derived single-chain antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that has caused an epidemic of human respiratory disease (COVID-19). It first emerged from the city of Wuhan in Hubei in December 2019 and has since spread widely in China and to more than 24 counties globally. The virus has been declared as a deadly global threat, and accelerated international efforts have been engaged to control the virus. A total of 1,524 deaths been confirmed as of 15th February 2020 (WHO). As a result of the rapid transmission internationally, a global call to control the spread of the virus in affected and non-affected areas has been implemented. Currently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine to control the virus. Symptoms of the infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause respiratory failure, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. The objectives of this application are 1) to develop antibodies that will block the entrance of the virus into the cells, and to test the efficacy of these antibodies in mice.",6, 6a

Yet, there is minimal evidence about how to care for patients with COVID-19 in hospital and how to maintain high quality non-COVID care during the pandemic. Detailed clinical data, such as patient vital signs or medications, are needed to study COVID-19 and its individual- and system-wide effects. These data are available in hospital computer systems but have not been widely collected and shared for research. The General Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) has collected detailed clinical data from >340,000 admissions at 7 hospitals in Ontario, making it the largest inpatient repository about adult medicine in Canada and a valuable data source to study COVID-19. We propose to create the COVID-19 Hospital Analytics Laboratory by extending GEMINI to the 30 largest hospitals in Ontario, representing 70% of acute medical/ICU beds in the province. We will collect detailed clinical data from all medical and ICU admissions, including COVID-19 and other medical illnesses. Data will be linked to ICES longitudinal population datasets and updated every 1-3 months to create a globally unique platform that enables advanced analytics and machine learning and includes a diverse sample of patients, meaning research insights will be widely applicable. This platform will address all 5 CIHR objectives by supporting a breadth of research focused on improving hospital care in the setting of COVID-19. Data will be accessible to global experts in artificial intelligence, operations engineering, population modeling, public health and clinical epidemiology. Our first two research priorities will be to improve understanding and prediction of clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to study how the organization of hospital care in the setting of COVID-19 affects patient outcomes.","4, 11","4b, 4c, 11a"

C06778,Small Molecule Screening to Identify Novel Sars-CoV-2 Therapeutics,"Summary: The current outbreak of the coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly. There are experimental drugswhich will be tested; however, there are no approved therapeutics or vaccines. Indeed, there are tests underway todetermine whether remdesivir, which was developed against filoviruses, can be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2infection. It would be transformative if we could identify additional small molecules that could be repurposed to treatthe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the goal of the parent grant (R01AI150246) is to discoverantivirals active against bunyaviruses, based on findings from cell based screening, and that we have broadexpertise in diverse viruses, we are applying for Supplemental funding (notice number NOT-AI-20-030, PA-18-035)to expand the scope of the existing grant to use the same methods (small molecule screening) to identify antiviraltherapeutics active against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will screen two libraries of known bioactives to potentiallyrepurpose existing therapeutics. First, we will test a library of innate immune agonists (~100 PAMPs) for their abilityto block SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells including airway cells. Second, we will screen another 'actionable'library that I have created as the Director of the High-throughput Screening core at UPENN. We created a library of~3000 drugs that includes ~1500 FDA approved compounds, ~1000 drugs in clinical trials and the remaining drugshave known targets. This library has been used for repurposing (as is being done with the Gilead drug remdesivirthat was originally developed against filoviruses) to more rapidly identify active therapeutics for future testing inhumans. We will also determine if any of our active antivirals act synergistically with remdesivir since this drug iscurrently under development for use against COVID-19.

While the full extent of its impact is not yet known, the disease and the response have disproportionately affected vulnerable populations in a wide range of areas, including access to justice. Some 1.5 billion people cannot access support to resolve their justice problems, such as denial of public services. Over half of the world'Äôs population (4.5 billion people) are affected to some degree by this growing justice gap. This has immediate impacts on individuals, including loss of livelihood, physical assets, and negative effects on mental and physical health. The situation is particularly acute for women and excluded groups 'Äî both a reflection and a driver of structural inequality and exclusion.     In response to these challenges, this project will create a knowledge hub built around a shared learning agenda to determine how legal empowerment can contribute to democratic governance and overcoming the multi-dimensional obstacles to development. Activities will be designed with a view to co-generating comparative research findings through a range of peer-to-peer exchanges, skills support, and larger regional and global convenings of the Legal Empowerment Network.     Those efforts are expected to improve the evidence base, research capacity, and methodologies on scaling up and deepening the impact of legal empowerment interventions. The knowledge hub and comparative lessons will spur greater awareness and action by governments, at both the national and global levels, on the urgency of addressing justice challenges within local and international development efforts.",10,10b

P22106,Control of influenza virus induced type I interferon signaling during pregnancy,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Infectious insults are common during pregnancy; over the nine months of gestation ~60% of pregnant women  self-report at least one illness, with viral upper respiratory tract (URT) infections being the most common.  Although URT-trophic viruses replicate in the respiratory epithelium, the induced inflammatory cytokines like  type I interferon (IFN) circulate systemically and can access the placenta. Recent work has shown that virally  induced type I IFNs can be major drivers of adverse effects on fetal development. URT infections during  pregnancy, however, are not typically linked to birth defects or miscarriage. It was therefore unclear why  maternal infection with a pathogen like an influenza virus, which also induces to fetal IFN exposure, would not  compromise fetal health. We hypothesized that an uncharacterized IFN regulatory pathway was the answer to  this apparent discrepancy. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screen, we identified a G-protein  coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) dependent signaling pathway that protected fetal health from type I IFN  signaling during maternal influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Disruption of this pathway led to fetal phenotypes  as severe as those caused by direct congenital infections. Importantly, the activities of this pathway were  restricted to reproductive and fetal tissues; alterations of its activity had no measurable effect on maternal  health during IAV infection. The major goal of this application is to understand how GPER1-mediated signaling  normally protects fetal health from inflammatory maternal cytokines such as type I IFN. In aim 1, we will define  how GPER1-induced GPCR signaling suppresses IFN-induced JAK/STAT signaling and interferon-stimulated  gene expression. These experiments will define a previously unknown mechanism for control of IFN signaling.  In aim 2, we will characterize where and when GPER1 signaling is required to protect fetal health, as well as  the effects of GPER1 dysregulation on cell physiology both in vivo and in primary human placental organoid  cultures. These experiments will allow basic mechanistic insights into how maternal inflammation compromises  fetal development. Finally, in aim 3, we will explore the consequences of IFN signaling on placental  structure/function when GPER1 is absent and also evaluate the potential of hyper-activating GPER1 signaling  under the inflammatory conditions that normally harm fetal development. Together, these studies will not only  allow for a more complete understanding of IFN regulatory mechanisms and the fetal/maternal immune  response but could also serve as the basis for an eventual first-in-class treatment designed to protect the fetus  from inflammation without compromising maternal immunity.","1, 4","1b, 1c, 1d, 4b"
C06211,"Measuring unanticipated opportunity costs of South Africa's COVID-19 response for children, mothers and people living with non-communicable diseases","Before the COVID-19 epidemic, SA's life expectancy was on an upward trajectory, with gains towards 2030 SDG targets. In response to the epidemic, the government instituted a lockdown to flatten the curve. Though there have been benefits, there are questions about the impact on non-COVID-19 health outcomes. Rapid decision making has also left community perspectives behind. SAMRC Centre for Health Economics and Decision Science-PRICELESS SA & the MRC/Wits Agincourt Unit have partnered to investigate this. Our hypotheses are firstly, that during COVID-19 epidemic there has been and will continue to be a decrease in supply and demand of routine health services which may impact on morbidity and mortality for individuals with HT, Diabetes, pregnant mothers and children under 5. Secondly, the perspective of health workers and community members regarding provision and access to routine health services during the COVID-19 epidemic will differ from that of public policy makers. The proposal aims to quantitatively measure the impact of diverting a workforce who are managing COVID-19, on routine preventive and curative health services. This will include supply and demand side perspectives. We will also qualitatively evaluate the views of the public and of healthcare workers in rural and urban areas. This will be a mixed-method study with a multi-disciplinary approach that will quantify health service opportunity costs due to the COVID-19 response. We will use a time series analysis of health services headcount data, addressing geographical and equity impacts, and qualitative interviews to understand the perspective of the public and health workers. The results will enable policymakers to make evidence-based decisions regarding resource allocation, between maintaining health services and mitigating the epidemic, that are also responsive to community needs and priorities.

Interventions are available to support family and friend caregivers experiencing adverse mental health outcomes such as burden or depression related to their caregiving role (e.g. exercise, psychotherapy, education, respite care); however, many of these interventions have not been directly compared in randomized trials. This makes it challenging for caregivers, clinicians, and policy makers to know which interventions will work the best in reducing these adverse mental health outcomes for family and friend caregivers. We will review the literature and identify all randomized trials describing the efficacy of in person and virtual interventions (e.g. by telephone or videoconference) for improving: symptoms of burden, distress, depression, anxiety, and loneliness; quality of life; and knowledge and caregiving skills of family and friend caregivers of people with dementia. This will be the first study of its kind to understand which interventions for family and friend caregivers of people with dementia will work the best and how these interventions might better support family and friend caregivers. We will identify interventions that will work better for different groups of caregivers (e.g. older women, older men).

C07286,"Museums, Crisis and Covid-19: Vitality and Vulnerabilities","The Covid-19 crisis is having a significant impact on the museum sector, nationally and globally. It is exposing the vulnerability of museums, their staff, projects and collections. Elsewhere, innovative programming is demonstrating the vitality and versatility of an engaged, responsive and participatory museum service, proving that museums are places of relevance even in a crisis.  This research project focuses on how museums can continue to contribute to community resilience and wellbeing in a time of crisis. It addresses sector adaptability as it adjusts audience engagement and collaboration (such as new collecting practices, programming and exhibitions) in response to Covid-19. The differing responses during the Covid-19 crisis - in some museums staff were furloughed yet elsewhere they have been involved in responsive projects - uncovers deeper attitudes to the essential (or otherwise) nature of museum services. Going forward, this project will lead and inform the sector as it adapts to effective community-digital possibilities that still embraces new thinking in participation and engagement. Alongside this, the project evaluates how we adapt our practices to be mindful of audience diversity, digital poverty, and the isolation challenges for vulnerable audiences arising from Covid-19. Rising to that challenge this project:  1. identifies how museum pedagogy and practices must adapt to new audience needs;  2. explores possibilities for co-produced community-digital innovation; and,  3. investigates the offer museums can make to support community resilience during and in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis. The importance of this project lies in the following areas. Firstly, new knowledge about the understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on the museum sector in NI that will both inform the Department for Communities (DfC) and have national relevance. Secondly, by generating new thinking around the community-digital dynamic and leading innovation as museums adapt. Thirdly, understanding the new needs around community resilience and wellbeing, arising from Covid-19. The Museums Association's response to the Covid-19 enquiry described museums as vital in supporting communities, promoting community cohesion, enabling wellbeing, and reflection on significant public issues. Many of our museums work with vulnerable groups, who will remain cautious/shielding post lockdown e.g. the Dementia Friendly Programme (NI Museums Council). This project will investigate the impact of putting such programmes on hold, how they can be effectively adapted/reinstated, and make recommendations for immediate application/future planning.","9, 10","9a, 9b, 10b, 10d"

C09619,Implementing genomic surveillance to support SARS-CoV-2 control and mitigation strategies in the Philippines,"As scientists and public health practitioners battle to understand and control the COVID-19 pandemic, the application of genomic surveillance i.e. tracking changes in the virus' genetic footprint, has become an invaluable tool. Genome sequences provide unique insights into how the virus is evolving and spreading and how it can be more effectively controlled. This information enhances traditional surveillance methods like contact tracing to resolve transmission scenarios e.g. providing evidence to determine the most likely route of transmission if an infected hospital worker has had multiple patient and community contacts, guiding improved infection control. It simultaneously provides a means to monitor the impact of control efforts, such as lockdown, by tracking the local extinction or re-introduction of virus lineages.  We propose to build genomic surveillance and response capacity in the Philippines, where it can inform infection control at local and regional scales, e.g within healthcare settings and between different islands or provinces. We will deploy the latest sequencing and analytical technologies to characterize virus circulation from archived samples and enable rapid interpretation of genomic data from new case investigations to directly inform responses. This approach will provide crucial and transferrable insights into SARS-CoV-2 dynamics across the island archipelago and globally.

P25014,ProteoCoV - Proteostasis as a target for antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 - Influence of SARS-CoV-2 on proteostatic processes of the cell.,"Therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 currently focus on repurposing of clinically approved drugs. Functional details on how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 are often unknown putting patient safety and clinical trials at risk.  Our previous study on MERS-CoV revealed that autophagy, a mechanism for non-selective lysosomal protein degradation, is blocked by MERS-CoV infection. We now confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 also limits autophagy. Targeted induction of autophagy by clinically approved drugs reduced MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our preliminary data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 promotes selected degradation of proteins by activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). We propose that SARS-CoV-2 modulates proteostasis by inhibiting non-selective autophagy while promoting selective proteasomal degradation.  In the proposed project, we will perform pulsed-SILAC to analyze details of protein degradation processes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection on a proteome-wide scale. Identification, characterization and validation of candidate proteins and respective protein-targeting drugs will be done by established in silico, molecular and protein-biochemical techniques in combination with virological methods. Identified, clinically approved drugs will be tested by implemented in vitro methods to determine SARS-CoV-2 growth inhibition in non-toxic, nanomolar concentrations possibly encouraging clinical trials. The mechanistic insights into the virus host interplay will reveal novel, hypothesis-driven treatment and drug repurposing strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","4, 6","4b, 6a"

Secondary objectives  1. To estimate the proportion of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic cases among participants with positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 infection  2. To estimate seroprevalence overall and by age group in each survey  3. To estimate in each survey the number of confirmed or probable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among seropositive participants.  4. To analyze the relationship between demographic and clinical characteristics, possible contact with a confirmed or probable case, and SARS-CoV-2 serostatus.  5. Retrospectively analyse of the sociological conditions of the contamination among serologically confirmed individuals.  Methodology: Three repeated general population surveys spaced 6 weeks apart. For each survey, we will use a two-stage random sampling design. The aim is to obtain a representative sample of the population of Conakry. Each survey is independent of the other.  Estimated enrolment 1400 individuals per survey  The calculation of the sample size is based on the hypothesis of a 10% difference in seroprevalence per age group between the first and second survey, using participants aged 40 years and older because they represent the smallest age group (17.5% of Conakry residents).  Assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.10, a participation rate of 90%, an average of one individual aged 40 and over per household visited (on average 6 residents per household in Conakry), with a confidence level α=0.05 and a power of 0.8 (β=0.2), 380 residents aged 40 and over, rounded up to 400 households, or 40 clusters of 10 households, will have to be included in each survey.

Eligibility  Inclusion criteria:   For adult participants (age ≥ 18 years old): Agree to participate in the study and sign the consent prior to any intervention.   For participants under the age of majority (between 10 and 17 years of age): Informed consent signed by at least one parent or legal guardian authorizing the child's participation in the study and the child's written consent to participate in the study.   For minor participants (age < 10 years): Informed consent signed by at least one parent or legal guardian authorizing the child's participation in the study.  Non-inclusion criteria:   Inability to comply with study requirements and procedures in the opinion of the investigator;   Inability to consent.  Statistical methods  The household questionnaire will be used for descriptive analyses on the included population and those who did not participate in the serological survey.  For each participant, several dimensions will be considered. The descriptive analyses will be weighted to take into account the probability of selection for cluster sampling and will be presented with a 95% confidence interval. Simple t-test and Pearson chi2 statistics will be used to compare the continuous and categorical descriptive results, respectively. Results will be calculated with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals and stratified by age group and sex. The actual intra-family correlation coefficient will be calculated at the end of the first survey.  Serological results will be stratified by age and weighted to take into account the sampling effect. Multivariate logistic models will assess the association between seroprevalence and risk factors in each study. After the first survey, a conventional cross-sectional analysis will be conducted followed by an incremental approach by pooling data from subsequent surveys and introducing a covariate coding for prevalence at each survey. Spatial heterogeneity will be taken into account.  The dynamics of the epidemic will be modelled using generalized linear models .

However, existing gaps in fundamental  knowledge about DENV and ZIKV immunity, specifically how type-specific immunity to each serotype develops  and is sustained, makes rational vaccine development particularly difficult. The dominant immunity model comes  from human challenge studies on DENV (1910Ã¢Â€Â™s-1940Ã¢Â€Â™s) and posits that first infection induces neutralizing  antibodies that provide life-long sterilizing immunity to repeat infections by the same (homotypic) serotype virus,  and this model has been extended to ZIKV without rigorous evaluation. However, recent studies from DENV  endemic regions provide evidence of homotypic re-infection and natural immune boosting over time and our  preliminary data from a non-endemic, Portland, Oregon resident DENV and ZIKV immune cohort show type-  specific Abs decay Ã¢Â€Â"" lose both potency and breadth - over time, calling into question sterilizing immunity and  leading us to hypothesize that natural flavivirus (ZIKV and DENV) protective immunity is context dependent: in  endemic transmission settings intermittent asymptomatic boosting maintains potency and breadth of virus  specific immunity and in non-endemic or very low transmission settings potency and breadth of flavivirus  immunity significantly wanes. To test this hypothesis, we propose to prospectively characterize and compare  DENV and ZIKV immunity in a regularly re-exposed endemic cohort in Ponce, Puerto Rico with immunity in an  un-boosted, non-endemic cohort of DENV immunes in Portland. This is a controversial and novel hypothesis  that will call for substantial supporting evidence, hence we will compare and contrast three highly relevant and  related markers of boosting between the two cohorts: The potency and breadth of neutralizing serum DENV and  ZIKV specific Abs (Aim 1), the frequency of and potency of DENV and ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1)  specific antibodies (Aim 2), and the frequency and specificity of DENV and ZIKV specific memory B-cells (MBCs)  (Aim 3). We expect to find that Abs and MBCs decline at a significantly greater rate in individuals from the non-  endemic setting compared to the endemic setting supporting the hypothesis that boosting plays a critical role in  natural immunity for these viruses, with implications for future vaccine development. Because MBCs are  functionally linked to Abs, quantifying virus specific MBCs tests a mechanistic connection between repeat  infection and Ab titer boosting. Our proposed work will comprehensively assess the role transmission context  plays in flavivirus immunity using two highly relevant and mechanistically linked determinants (Ab and MBC).  Irrespective of specific results, the knowledge obtained from the proposed work will be essential to DENV vaccine  development and mechanistic understanding of flavivirus Ab mediated immunity.",1,"1b, 1d"

C18112,Platform Adaptive trial of NOvel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of COVID-19 In the Community (PANORAMIC),"Research question Does antiviral treatment in the community safely reduce hospitalisations/deaths in symptomatic patients with confirmed COVID-19? Background Many people with COVID continue to suffer serious acute illness, with hospitalisations remaining a significant burden on the NHS. Aims and Objectives PANORAMIC's primary objective is to assess effectiveness of novel antiviral treatment(s) in safely reducing all cause hospitalisation and/or death within 28 days from randomisation, in high-risk patients with a confirmed PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in the community. The main secondary outcomes will be return to full-function, prevention of severe disease, reduction in symptoms, speed of recovery, including among clinically vulnerable groups. A Viral Load Sub-Study will investigate the impact of antivirals on viral load, time to virus clearance and an assessment of potential for development of resistance under drug selective pressure A Post-exposure Prophylaxis Sub-Study will determine how effective the antiviral is in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when given to household contacts of index cases who have given consent. Methods PANORAMIC will have UK-wide reach. A master protocol will govern the platform trial with a Bayesian analytic approach. All enrolment (screening, informed consent, eligibility review and baseline data) and follow-up procedures (daily diary, data capture of hospitalisations and deaths) can be performed and captured online on the trial website or by telephone with a member of the trial team. Adults aged 18 or above who are clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable, or aged 50 and above, with a positive SARS-COV-2 PCR test and symptoms of COVID-19 illness starting within the previous 5 days will be eligible. They will complete screening and informed consent online or by phone with a member of the trial team and be randomised to receive usual NHS care or an antiviral plus usual NHS care. Antivirals will be delivered directly to the participant using urgent courier. Participants will be asked daily whether they feel recovered by text, phone or email, for 28 days, and follow-up at 3 and 6 months for assessment of longer-term effects. Hospitalisation and deaths will be captured either patient report or by NHS Digital data extracts. Recovery will be patient reported. Safety will be closely monitored appropriate to the stage of development of each agent and availability existing data, with capacity for an intensive monitoring and sampling phase followed by potential graduation to a remote monitoring phase. Timelines for Delivery The University of Oxford University has demonstrated capacity for efficiently and effectively sponsoring national platform trials. Using our established broad approach, we plan to start on September 1st, 2021 with the first patient randomised within one or two months, with first findings out in 18 months. Impact and dissemination PANORAMIC will uniquely expand the evidence about the effectiveness of novel antivirals to benefit COVID patients in the NHS and worldwide. Results will be rapidly disseminated through pre-prints, publications and notification on the trial website, as well as direct to the MHRA, Antiviral Task Force, NICE, the WHO, and guideline developers world-wide.",6,6j
C15154,Risk Factors for AIDS among Persons Who Inject Drugs: HIV and COVID-19,"Abstract  It is difficult to underestimate the potential public health significance of the COVID-19 pandemic for generating  new outbreaks of HIV among PWID. While public health scale implementation of ""combined prevention and  care for HIV"" among PWID has led to dramatic reductions in HIV transmission in many high-income countries,  multiple outbreaks of HIV have also occurred, e.g., in the US, Western and Eastern Europe, and Israel. While  there were distinct features of each outbreak, a number of common features were noted across the outbreaks,  including: 1) community economic dislocations, 2) inadequate or interrupted HIV prevention services, 3) local  introduction of new injectable drugs, and 4) homeless PWID as a very high-risk group. The COVID-19  pandemic and its associated lockdown/control measures appear to be re-creating the very conditions that  generated HIV outbreaks among PWID in the pre- COVID-19 era. The recent FDA emergency use  authorization of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provides a critical opportunity to alleviate some-but certainly  not all-of the threats to HIV prevention. However, important potential difficulties in rapidly vaccinating large  numbers of PWID exist. We propose to examine relationships between HIV, COVID-19, and racial/ethnic  disparities among PWID in NYC, a location that has experienced the world's largest local HIV epidemic among  PWID, and one of the world's largest local COVID-19 epidemics, through four specific aims:  1. Assess short term (within 3 years) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV risk among PWID in NYC,  including potential increases in critical bio-behavioral risks (composite risk for HIV transmission and composite  multi-person risk for HIV acquisition).  2. Monitor SARS-CoV-2 vaccination over time among PWID in NYC. Identify factors associated with receiving  vaccination, including 'underlying health conditions,"" socio-demographics, particularly race/ethnicity and  employment, vaccine awareness and attitudes, and across patterns of drug use. Examine peer, family and  ""trusted sources"" influences on receiving vaccination. Educate participants on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,  including availability, types, side effects and scheduling. Assess the extent to which ""herd immunity"" is being  achieved among PWID.  3. Utilize antibody testing to estimate past and incident COVID-19 infection among PWID, identifying risk  factors for infection, including race/ethnicity, and whether practicing protective behaviors is associated with  lower seroprevalence.  4. Using principal component analysis (PCA), examine relationships between multiple health problems and  social determinants of health among PWID in NYC, including HIV, COVID-19, HCV, opioid and stimulant use,  drug overdose, homelessness, and economic and food insecurity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Examine  patterns of racial/ethnic disparities among the clusters of health and social determinants of health.","1, 4, 9","1d, 4a, 9a"
P22426,Scalable Inference in Statistical Models of Viral Evolution and Human Health,"Project Summary / Abstract  Despite global public health advances, viruses remain a major threat to human health both in the United  States and internationally. Recent and continuing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Zika, Lassa fever, and  Chikungunya, as well as persistent epidemics such as HIV have emphasized the need to understand viral  evolution and virus-host interactions during epidemics. Phylogenetic statistical models of viral evolution offer  a powerful tool for studying the interplay between viral genetics and environmental or host factors. However,  current phylogenetic models are often too inÃ¯Â¬Â'exible to realistically model these relationships, and those that  do are computationally intractable for even moderately sized data sets. This project aims to develop new  statistical models that are both Ã¯Â¬Â'exible enough to model complex biological relationships and scalable to large  data sets of viral and host traits. The Ã¯Â¬Ârst aim is to develop more efÃ¯Â¬Âcient and less biased statistical methods  for estimating the heritability of viral phenotypes (e.g. viral load, host CD4 T-cell count, replicative capacity).  Current statistical practices typically produced biased heritability estimates and are intractable for large data  sets. This project seeks to extend state-of-the-art inference techniques to model the heritability of viral pheno-  types (enabling both unbiased and efÃ¯Â¬Âcient inference) and to apply these new methods to better estimate the  heritability of viral load in HIV-1. The second aim seeks to develop statistical methods for studying complex,  high-dimensional viral phenotypes such as infection severity which cannot be captured with a single measure-  ment. These phenotypes are difÃ¯Â¬Âcult to quantify due to their inherent complexity, confounding rigorous efforts  at, say, identifying unusually virulent viral clades. While phylogenetic factor analysis enables identiÃ¯Â¬Âcation and  quantiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of high-dimensional phenotypes, it scales poorly to large data sets. We propose new inference  techniques that address these scalability problems and allow previously intractable analyses. We plan to apply  these new methods to study patterns of virulence in Ebola and Lassa fever and to identify unusually virulent  viral strains. Additionally, these methods are well suited to identifying epistatic interactions between viral mu-  tations and phenotypes of interest, and we plan to explore these interactions in HIV, Zika, and Chikungunya  viruses. The third aim is to develop new statistical models speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally designed to predict outcomes of viral  infections from viral sequence data. To accommodate the necessary Ã¯Â¬Â'exibility required by these models, we  develop new inference strategies that are both highly generalizable (i.e. they do not rely on strict assumptions  in existing models) and computationally efÃ¯Â¬Âcient. Strong predictive performance would enable researchers or  clinicians to predict clinically relevant outcomes using viral sequences, which could help inform treatment. We  will evaluate these methods using the Ebola and Lassa fever data from mentioned above.",3,3d

P22109,Modulating gene expression by RNA-targeting chimeras,"PROJECT SUMMARY   RNA-binding small molecules have the potential to modulate the expression of genes whose protein  products were previously considered Ã¢Â€Âœundruggable.Ã¢Â€Â Risdiplam, targeting a precursor mRNA, was recently  approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and demonstrates the specificity and safety  attainable by this approach. Although a variety of small-molecule scaffolds have been uncovered as RNA-binding  ligands, their use is hampered by (1) lack of specificity and (2) unpredictable function. We propose a research  program that will provide RNA-targeting chemical probes that will avoid these drawbacks. Inspired by Proteolysis  Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, we are designing chimeric molecules that will target RNA specifically  and carry (deliver) the ability to induce RNA degradation or inhibit RNA translation, in a highly predictable manner.   Our initial efforts towards an RNA-targeting chimera platform use a newly discovered RNA-binding  coumarin derivative as a model and fine-tune its preferential binding properties through chemical modification.  Through structural optimization, which includes using a Ã¢Â€ÂœbidentateÃ¢Â€Â RNA ligand strategy, we expect to achieve  RNA-binding selectivity equal to or greater than that of oligonucleotides. At the same time, we propose to develop  and optimize three novel effectors to precisely degrade RNA targets or inhibit the target RNA translation. These  new effectors have shown promising results in inhibiting Zika virus (an RNA virus) gene expression. Ultimately,  our proposed work will generate a top-down method for designing selective gene expression inhibitors that are  independent of the gene's protein product.   The long-term goal of our lab is to build a medicinal chemistry platform for making gene-specific and  patient-specific therapies using RNA-binding small molecules. In this process, we will not only generate various  tool compounds for studying important disease-modifying genes, but also combine computational and  experimental technologies to understand the detailed mechanism of RNA-small molecule recognition.",6,6a
P25416,Lungy: Development of a Smartphone-based Breathing Management Platform with Integrated Spirometry and Peak Flow Measurement,"Lungy  (https://www.lungy.app) is a breathing management platform that uses the smartphone camera and microphone to recognise, track and respond to breathing in real-time. It is under development for patients with breathing problems such as asthma, COPD and long-COVID. The application will encourage and guide patients through a range of relaxing breathing exercises, promoting not only breathing function but also focus, user engagement, and mindfulness. The application is intended to be accessible and engaging for everyone, but also to improve both physical and mental health through regular breathing exercise. With further development, the combination of data obtained from the app could provide a plastic and hardware-free, eco-friendly alternative to traditional methods of measuring breathing function, such as the spirometry used in COPD and peak flow measurements used in asthma.  Lungy s underlying breath recognition technology has already been developed and validated in a proof-of-concept app for patients with stress and anxiety (and no underlying respiratory problems) with >10,000 beta testers. This project would evaluate the feasibility of the app in measuring peak flow and spirometry, by developing new machine-learning models that run on the acquired data. Focus groups of patients with asthma and COPD will be arranged by the UK's largest breathing charities - Asthma + Lung UK - to assess the potential benefits and barriers to the adoption of a smartphone-based spirometry platform. This will ensure the app remains patient-centred at every stage, informing the user interface design and future development. If successful, this project could add new functionality to the platform, enabling larger studies and leading to further funding, as well as helping to develop a powerful tool for the self-management of breathing problems.",4,"4c, 4d"
C03865,Innate Immune Regulation of the Epithelium in Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,"ABSTRACTThe ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major threat to global health.The nasal passages are the key portal of entry for airway virus infections, and evidencesuggests that the nasal epithelium is a key reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 and a source of viralshedding that accounts for high transmissibility and elevated rates of COVID-19. We hypothesize that diminished interferon-induced innate immune responses in infected nasal epithelial cells is a primary mechanism allowing rapid viral replication without cytotoxicity. Theparent grant focuses on how human sinonasal epithelial cell populations participate in immunedefense and damage repair. In this supplement proposal, in response to NOT-AI-20-031, wewill extend these studies to research in depth the epithelial cell innate immune response toSARS-CoV-2. Specifically, delayed interferon signaling may prevent induction of nitric oxide,which has been previously shown to inhibit viral entry and replication. Nitric oxide can beinduced in nasal epithelial by stimuli other than interferon, including through activation of bittertaste receptors expressed on the cilia. There are a number of approved medications in clinicaluse that taste bitter and can bind to bitter taste receptors. Among these, certain anti-nausea and antihistamines are particularly strong bitter taste agonists. In this proposal, we will test the ability of these medications to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells invitro. We will then use pharmacologic modulators of the bitter taste signaling and nitric oxidepathways to establish the mechanism of action of drugs that decrease infection. We will also determine if these medications impact the interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ifsuccessful, these studies may lay the foundation for novel therapeutic approaches to enhancethe initial epithelial cell innate immune defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, limitingprogression of COVID-19 and decreasing transmissibility.","1, 6","1d, 6a, 6g"
P21951,"Genetic, structural and functional profiling of the human antibody response to arenavirus infection","PROJECT SUMMARY  Arenaviruses are a family of zoonotic RNA viruses that are capable of causing severe hemorrhagic fever disease  in humans. Lassa virus (LASV), an Old World arenavirus which is endemic in regions of West Africa including  Sierra Leone and is the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), causes thousands of deaths annually. Arenaviruses  have repeatedly crossed over into humans over the past several decades, and emerging variants of known  arenaviruses often display increased human-to-human transmissibility and broader geographic range. For these  reasons, the CDC and WHO have classified several human arenaviruses as high priority pathogens and the  PREDICT consortium ranked LASV as the highest risk virus on their watchlist of potential pandemic pathogens.  Vaccines and therapeutics against arenaviruses are urgently needed, however, we must first gain a much deeper  understanding of the molecular mechanisms that result in protective humoral immunity. Although the discovery  of effective clinical countermeasures is the ultimate goal, this collaborative project focuses on leveraging  innovative, high-throughput antibody discovery and characterization tools to define the genetic, functional and  structural properties of anti-LASV antibodies with broad specificity across human arenaviruses. We have  assembled a collaborative, multidisciplinary group of investigators with a long history of productive collaboration  in viral immunology and with complementary areas of expertise. Additionally, we have access to a singular cohort  of LF survivors at Kenema Government Hospital, which is located in Sierra Leone and is at the heart of the LF  zone. We expect our work will result in the discovery of thousands of novel anti-LASV antibodies, characterization  of which will reveal conserved sites of viral vulnerability and uncover the precise molecular mechanisms of viral  neutralization. These fundamental studies directly address critical gaps in our understanding of the interplay  between humoral immunity and hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses and will serve as a foundation for future  translational studies.

Trainees' overall progression throughout the training period is closelymonitored. Trainees are regularly evaluated through their course work and through progress on their researchprojects.",11,11d
P22716,Quantifying the genetic and environmental factors driving avian influenza spillover,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Past influenza cross-species transmission events have lead to devastating human pandemics. H5N1 is an  avian influenza virus that has caused recurrent, high pathogenicity human infections since 1997. Humans  usually acquire H5N1 through interaction with live birds, and mounting evidence suggests that H5N1 circulation  in poultry is strongly linked to human infection. Despite this, the genetic and environmental factors that  promote H5N1 circulation in poultry remain unknown. A predominant hypothesis is that wild birds seed  new viruses into poultry, and humans acquire infection via poultry interaction. However, the rate of  transmission between wild birds and poultry has never been estimated. Although certain husbandry  practices like outdoor rearing and transport to large, live poultry markets are hypothesized to enhance H5N1  circulation, the relative contributions of these husbandry practices have never been systematically  assessed. Finally, virologic studies have produced a catalogue of mutations associated with human adaptation  in laboratory and animal studies, which are currently used to query emerging H5N1 strains and assess  pandemic risk. However, many human-infecting H5N1 strains lack known markers of adaptation, and it is  unclear whether these mutations predict spillover risk in nature. In this proposal, I will use phylogenetic  and statistical methods to determine the genetic and environmental drivers of H5N1 cross-species  transmission through 3 specific aims. Completion of these projects with my mentors and co-mentors will  allow me to achieve my career goal of transitioning to an independent faculty role by the end of the K99 phase.  1. I will use a recently developed structured coalescent model to estimate the rate of H5N1  transmission between wild birds, poultry, and humans. I hypothesize that cross-species transmission  occurs frequently between wild birds and poultry, but only a small subset of lineages circulate long-term. I  expect to observe ongoing transmission in poultry, but not in humans.  2. I will use phylogenetic and statistical methods to determine the environmental and husbandry  practices that promote long-term H5N1 circulation in poultry. I hypothesize that short-term spillover events  will be associated with outdoor poultry housing and rice cropping. Long-term establishments will be correlated  with poor vaccination coverage and introduction into a large poultry market.  3. Elucidate genetic and phenotypic determinants of cross-species transmission. I will combine the  power of a genome-wide scan with phenotypic validation to identify the genetic correlates of avian influenza  spillover. I hypothesize that H5N1 lineages that are prone to human spillover will be enriched for mutations  experimentally linked to host switching. I predict that our scan will identify mutations that elicit improved human  receptor binding, enhanced replication in mammalian cells, and abrogation of interferon production.",2,2a
C09965,STAMINA: Strategies to Mitigate Nutritional Risks among mothers and infants under 2 years in low income urban households in Peru during COVID-19,"Peru's progress in combatting malnutrition may be reversed with the current COVID-19 pandemic which has caused disruption of maternal and infant nutrition services, closure of health centres and rising unemployment. Peru has experienced one of the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in South America. Deteriorations in infant nutrition will lead to poorer health outcomes for the next generation. Government and community stakeholders in Peru have highlighted the unknown impacts of the pandemic on the nutrition of mothers and their infants and young children. This study will examine how the COVID-19 response is impacting on the nutritional risks of mothers and infants (aged 0-23 months) within the household setting in low-income areas of two cities, Huánuco and Lima. This information will be compared with detailed nutritional assessments conducted in the same communities immediately before the national State of Emergency due to COVID-19. To address the emerging nutritional risks, we will work with stakeholders to co-create adapted methods for the delivery of nutritional services including iron supplementation and support for exclusive and continued breastfeeding.  We will identify the nutritional risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by examining short, medium and longer term changes in: - exclusive breastfeeding rates for infants aged 0-6 months; continued breastfeeding for infants aged 6-23 months, and the extent to which WHO recommended complementary feeding practices are being met.  - the uptake of iron supplementation in infants and young children - a national priority to combat anaemia - in the context of the disrupted health services and new delivery strategies implemented since the pandemic.  - household food security, maternal psychological wellbeing, and changing quality of diet in relation to nutritional risks of undernutrition as well as overweight and obesity at the household level. - how household dietary practices adapt and respond to the ongoing pandemic. With these insights, we will co-create support systems for the design or adapted delivery of nutritional counselling, growth monitoring and iron supplementation for infants and young children using information and communication technologies or socially-distanced health services.   We will work with UNICEF Peru as a project partner in order to ensure that efforts to address malnutrition target the most vulnerable groups and are tailored to the challenges experienced by urban communities which make up the majority population of Peru.",10,10a
C04168,Blood Vessels-on-Chip to Understand and Target COVID-19,"Project description  When COVID-19 patients become seriously ill, they often have problems in their blood vessels. This is how we see leakage, inflammation and blood clotting. In this project, a mini-blood vessel based on human vascular wall tissue and COVID-19 patient plasma is used to study blood clot formation. It is not yet clear why vascular problems occur in COVID-19 and whether they offer starting points for treatments. Finding answers to these questions is made difficult because laboratory animals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus do not develop complications in their blood vessels. It is therefore essential to perform this research using human tissues. In the project, researchers from the University of Twente will build and analyze the mini-blood vessels. Researchers from the Amsterdam UMC will collect and characterize the patient plasma for these models. Experts from the LUMC will perform molecular biological analysis on the cultured tissues.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
C09945,"Routes of infection, routes to safety: Creative mapping of human-viral behaviours on the bus to understand infection prevention practices","There is an absence of qualitative, interdisciplinary research on the personal application of infection prevention (IP) measures, like hand-washing and mask-wearing, and its effectiveness beyond the healthcare setting. In this crisis, IP measures are critical to building confidence to resume leisure and economic activity out of the home. The project advances previous work by this team that identified a need for novel IP research which integrates behavioural, microbiological and aesthetic approaches to creatively demonstrate the interactions of human movement with microbial/viral transmission.    The case study is the public transport bus and its diverse community of users, including BAME and other higher-risk groups. The research will: i) investigate the structural challenges in consistent application of IP in public (and private) spaces; ii) provide microbiological and sociological evidence to inform and improve effective cleaning practices for bus operators and safe travel practices for bus users; iii) generate wider public knowledge and understanding of infection risk/prevention and their geographies in shared indoor spaces.     This project will build confidence by addressing unknowns about the potential viral threat of boarding the bus. The team will work quickly to undertake and integrate findings from an ethnographic research and a microbiome study to assess the effectiveness of bus cleaning routines and passenger PPE. A fluorescents mapping simulation using ultraviolet powders and sprays will mimic and demonstrate visually the mobility of 'mock' SARS-CoV-2 through contact and aerosols if IP measures are not implemented. Outputs include the creation of novel viral aesthetic materials to communicate the effectiveness of IP.","5, 9","5b, 9c"
C03635,COVID communication: Fighting a pandemic through translating science,"An infectious disease is a special type of health challenge with its potential for rapid incidence growth. When dealing with such exponential growth regarding potential spread, if an imposed societal measure does not feel drastic, it may already be too late. This has strong implications for public health communication. Bringing about attitude change and acceptance for strict regulations requires explaining health science topics so that also non-experts can quickly understand. How to go about to succeed at this is largely unknown. As media habits have changed, video has become a preferred medium constituting almost 80% of all internet traffic. Yet little is known about how to most effectively use video for relaying complex health messages.     The aim of this study is to develop effective, evidence-based video communication for translating complex but important health messages about infectious diseases and pandemics, using COVID-19 as a case to learn and prepare society for handling also future pandemics. Creating effective science communication requires interdisciplinary collaboration, and the project will bring together health professionals and scholars, media creatives, psychologists, statisticians and professional communicators. The study population will include representatives from both the general public and decision makers as part of a holistic approach to how health related risk is understood and communicated on all levels. The general population is a heterogenous group and a one-size-fits-all solution is not to be expected.",9,9c
P23597,PORTABLE PLATFORM FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF MICROVASCULAR HEALTH IN COVID-19 PATIENTS AT THE INTENSIVE CARE,"As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, the surge in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission has been overwhelming to the healthcare systems. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources is needed but is hindered due to lack of personalization. The management of acute respiratory failure and hemodynamics is critical at the ICU. In fact, of the seven million COVID-19 cases (end of May 2020) 3-12% required mechanical ventilation which forms the primary target of VASCOVID where we focus on;  (1) patient stratification derived from endothelial function evaluation, and, (2) evaluation of cardiopulmonary interactions that personalizes conservative ventilation strategies in order to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury and readiness to wean from the ventilator. VASCOVID will deploy and mature our portable, non-invasive and real-time health monitoring platform for this purpose. This platform combines two bio-photonics technologies, time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy, and is the fruit of long-term collaboration between core project partners in two European projects (BabyLux and LUCA) where high technology readiness level have been achieved for neuro-monitoring and thyroid cancer screening. VASCOVID will adapt the platform to meet the needs of a typical ICU dealing with COVID-19 and other patients requiring ventilation, as well as to leverage large-scale testing of new treatment procedures and therapies aimed to address microvascular impairment and to reduce extubation failure on ICU patients weaning out of mechanical ventilation life-support. The platform is easy to deploy, cost-effective and provides real-time fast results and its transition to clinical practice will be eased through this project by pushing CE certification. Our inter-disciplinary consortium is well-suited for these activities and will interact closely with our on-going clinical study spanning four countries and a dozen hospitals.",4,4c

C06827,Developing an Online Tai Ji Program to Improve Health Outcomes in Older Adults,"Project Summary/AbstractBackground. The ongoing COVID-19 public health crisis is significantly impacting older Americans who are athigher risk for severe illness from novel coronavirus infection. The implementation of shelter-in-place andsocial distancing, though an essential step in reducing transmission of the virus, has imposed unintendedpersonal life hurdles and major social constraints on cognitively impaired older adults. Many of theseindividuals are dependent on community-based services for care and support and therefore face greatchallenges to performing essential social activities, including attending community-based exercise classes.Given that the signs of the outbreak abating are still vague and that there is the likelihood of new outbreak thiswinter, the continued enforced societal isolation will exacerbate sedentary behaviors in a population withalready low levels of physical activity and poor physical and mental health outcomes. Objectives. Thisapplication requests Administrative Supplement to support the development and testing of an Internet-basedexercise intervention (Tai Ji Quan Moving to Improve Brain Health [TJQMIBH]) using real-timevideoconferencing for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The proposed work aligns with thescope of our parent project (AG059546), which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of an in-person, group-based, cognitive-motor-integrated Tai Ji Quan intervention for this vulnerable and at-risk population. The fundsfrom this Administrative Supplement will support research work related to the following four specific aims:Specific Aim 1: to transform the in-person TJQMIBH intervention protocol into a deliverable online classprotocol; Specific Aim 2: to pilot test the online TJQMIBH virtual class delivery protocol in older adults withMCI; Specific Aim 3: To develop effective and protected online assessment and data ascertainmentprocedures encompassing the cognitive and physical performance measures; and Specific Aim 4: to conducta randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of the virtual TJQMIBH intervention with a stretchingexercise control group among older adults with MCI. Significance and Impact. Shelter-in-place and social-distancing policies in response to COVID-19 have left older adults with cognitive impairment with few or noopportunities to continue physical activity in their community. Evidence suggests that limited or no physicalactivity may lead to an increased risk and potential worsening of chronic health conditions for this at-riskpopulation. Meanwhile, there are few Internet-based exercise programs available to keep older adults activeand healthy in the highly contagious COVID-19 environment. Our project addresses this urgent public healthneed by developing and delivering a virtual exercise program at home through the Internet. If successful, theoutcome from this project will exert a sustained, powerful influence on the field of disease prevention byproviding a safe, accessible, and effective exercise intervention for older adults with cognitive impairment thatcan be implemented both under current extreme conditions and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.",10,10a

The initiative will support research on building resilience and preparedness to serve the needs of refugees and other populations on the move by promoting intersectoral approaches, including building bridges between humanitarian and development responses to reduce and control health risks for displaced populations. It will leverage existing local opportunities to strengthen the overall initiative.      This project will generate evidence on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugees and internally displaced people in the West Bank and the health system'Äôs ability to meet their needs. It will also strengthen the health system through incorporating research and health information system improvements. Activities will include initial rapid situation assessments and community engagement to analyze the pandemic response and engage with institutional and policy stakeholders. This will be followed by larger scale quantitative and qualitative research activities. Finally, the research will be presented in an accessible format for policymakers and practitioners to inform long-term health system preparedness and resilience.     The project will also support capacity building for research in health system preparedness with regards to human resources, information systems, and community engagement. This will lead to enhanced knowledge production, both for short-term rapid response to COVID-19, and for a long-term participatory approach to pandemic preparedness and resilience from a gender and equity perspective for refugee and internally displaced populations.",10,"10b, 10d"
P25002,ExComPat-Covid19 - Experimental and computational analysis of infection dynamics and lung pathology in COVID-19 - Subproject A,"The infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and its association with disease progression is still incompletely understood. To which extent viral replication kinetics and virus-associated tissue pathology determine patient outcome remains an open question that is of urgent importance to advise effective treatment strategies. In this project, we will combine experimental data of lung organoids with detailed mathematical and computational models to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics under physiologically relevant conditions. By integrating spatially-resolved microscopy images with time course infection data of SARS-CoV-2 in lung organoids by mathematical analyses we will be able to quantify key parameters governing viral replication and spread, and their association with pathological changes. Extending the computational model to extrapolate infection dynamics within a human lung, we will be able to relate observed viral load kinetics in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to expected tissue pathology and disease progression. This will help to assess the significance of viral load levels for associated lung pathology during infection. Our interdisciplinary approach will improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread within lung tissue and its association with disease progression. Furthermore, the inferred computational model provides a tool to test the efficacy of antiviral therapies and represents a first step towards a mechanistic model of infection progression within tissue that could improve our understanding of individual patient outcome.",4,4b
P22082,Multiplex Serodiagnostic Assays for Pathogenic Arboviruses in Brazil,"Abstract   A critical need exists for highly sensitive and specific serodiagnostic tests to discriminate infections by  pathogenic arboviruses in geographic regions, such as Brazil, where multiple flaviviruses including Zika virus  (ZIKV), four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever (YFV), as well as  chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) (both alphaviruses) and Oropouche virus (OROV) (a  bunyavirus), are endemic. However, cross-reactivity of antibodies against different flaviviruses present major  challenges, such that even neutralization tests cannot confirm a specific flavivirus infection among individuals  who have experienced previous flavivirus infections.   The objective of the proposed research is to develop highly sensitive and specific serodiagnostic tests to  discriminate infections by pathogenic arboviruses. The central hypothesis is that a combination of fusion loop  (FL)-mutated VLPs and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) proteins of different flaviviruses and recombinant proteins  and VLPs of CHIKV, MAYV and OROV in multiplex formats can distinguish different arbovirus infections.   The first Aim is to develop and validate multiplex IgG and IgM microsphere immunoassays (MIAs) based on  recombinant proteins to distinguish arbovirus infections. We will employ recombinant NS1 proteins of 7  flaviviruses, envelope (E) 2 protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein of CHIKV, MAYV and OROV for multiplex IgG  and IgM MIAs using Luminex 200 and test with 15 panels of convalescent-phase serum/plasma from individuals  with confirmed arbovirus infections. The second Aim is to develop and validate multiplex IgG and IgM MIAs based  on VLPs to distinguish arbovirus infections. We will use purified and FL-mutated VLPs of 7 flaviviruses and VLPs  of CHIKV, MAYV and OROV, and test with 15 panels of serum/plasma as in Aim 1. The third Aim is to compare  the multiplex IgM MIAs and IgG MIAs with currently available serodiagnostic assays to determine arbovirus  seroprevalence in Bahia, a northeastern state with multiple arbovirus transmissions in Brazil. For serodiagnosis,  we will test serum samples from patients with acute febrile illness and their follow-up at outpatient clinics of 4 study  sites (Salvador, Feira de Santana, Itabuna and Campo Formoso) in Bahia. For seroprevalence study, we will  enroll and test household members at communities of the 4 study sites.   The proposed study is innovative as it employs two promising antigens (NS1 protein and FL-mutated VLPs) to  overcome flavivirus cross-reactivity for seven flaviviruses, as opposed to traditional E protein-based tests, plus  CHIKV, MAYV and OROV in two multiplex formats to discriminate arbovirus infections in Brazil. It would  contribute to a detailed understanding of the epidemiology of 10 arbovirus infections in Bahia. The successful  employment of the multiplex platforms can serve as a new paradigm for serodiagnosis and serosurveillance in  countries where multiple arboviruses co-circulate. Most importantly, this research will facilitate the  implementation of arbovirus vaccines, in particular ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV vaccines in endemic regions.","1, 3","1d, 3d"
C04208,Understanding the two faces of the COVID-19 immune response to predict clinical course and define strategies for early and late phase intervention,"Project description  The immune system plays a striking double role in COVID-19. An effective immune response ensures that the virus is attacked and cleared away, but if that does not work properly, a hyper-activation of the immune system appears to arise, which can lead to serious problems. It is unclear what exactly goes wrong in the immune system in patients with a severe course and how they can best be treated. The use of immunosuppressive medications is one of the possible strategies.

C15860,Impact of immunosenescence on in vitro response of B lymphocytes of individuals vaccinated against COVID-19: influence of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"The fact that COVID-19 pandemia has led to an unprecedented, worldwide effort to develop a vaccine able to confer protection to a large and heterogeneous population, gave rise to the reemergence of the issue of vaccination of elderly and those bearing chronic diseases. While these populations show enhanced susceptibility to the severe forms of the COVID-19, they also tend to develop weaker vaccine responses compared with youngs and adults in general. Aged people are immunologically characterized for presenting immunosenescence. This condition refers to a state defined by robust measures of immune parameters (biomarkers) that are different in younger and older individuals that have been associated with detrimental clinical outcome (e.g. mortality, frailty, poor response to vaccination). Individuals suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases. e.g., COPD patients also develop a phenotype called accelerated immunosenescence. Several aspects of immunosenescence have been investigated in the last two decades, mostly dealing with the T lymphocyte compartment. Information regarding alterations of the B lymphocyte compartment linked to immunosenescence are less well understood and less well established, as can be exemplified by the role of B lymphocytes in the poorer vaccine responses of the elderly. Therefore, this project aims to investigate the B lymphocyte response and production of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins after vaccination against COVID-19. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy aged individuals (e 60 y-o), patients with COPD, aged smokers but without pulmonary impairment compatible with COPD, will be compared with PBMC from young adults (e 35 y-o). PBMC cultures will be submitted to several analyses: phenotyping assays (flow cytometry) to determine the B lymphocyte subpopulations and the expression of surface and intracellular functional molecules, assays for purifying B lymphocyte population followed by in vitro expansion of these cells, and then exposure to specific viral proteins to evaluate the capacity of clonal expansion, specific antibody production and pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines secretion, as well as testing the B lymphocyte culture supernatants in a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Some features of the T-cell responses will also be assessed, such as Th patterns, cytokines and immunophenotyping. We expect, with these experiments, to collect relevant data aiming at better characterizing B lymphocyte responses to the vaccine in the healthy aged and in the aged with comorbidities. This knowledge is crucial for the design of better vaccine candidates in this specific population: beyond the well-known effects of immunosenescence on the T-cell compartment, information regarding B lymphocyte dysfunctions may uncover novel mechanisms that impair vaccines response, particularly regarding the amount and quality of the antibody production.","1, 7","1d, 7l"
P25430,"Improving the lives of people living with chronic breathlessness due to advance disease via a self-guided, internet-based breathlessness supportive intervention SELF-BREATHE","Background   Some health conditions make breathing difficult and uncomfortable. When this happens every day, it is called chronic breathlessness. Over 3 million people living with heart and lung disease have chronic breathlessness in the UK. In addition, people living with long COVID commonly have breathlessness and they struggle to manage it.  Breathlessness is very difficult for patients themselves and their families, resulting in disability and feelings of fear, distress, and isolation. Due a to lack of supportive breathlessness services many patients frequently attend hospital Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments seeking help.   Given the on-going challenges faced by the NHS such as long waiting times, staff shortages, increased demand for services because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to develop new ways to support those living with chronic breathlessness. One potential solution is to offer support online as in the UK, 7 out of every 10 people with chronic breathlessness are internet users.  With the help of patients and NIHR funding I developed an online breathlessness supportive website called SELF-BREATHE. SELF-BREATHE provides information and self-management tools such as breathing exercises, that patients can do at home themselves.   I have tested SELF-BREATHE as part of its development and it is acceptable and valued by patients. But what is unknown is whether SELF-BREATHE improves patients' breathlessness and their life? This is the question my research seeks to answer.   Aims   1. To test if using SELF-BREATHE for six-weeks improves patients' breathlessness, their quality of life and whether SELF-BREATHE should be offered within the NHS     2. To see if patients opt to continue to use SELF-BREATHE after six-weeks and what benefits this may have for patients.   Methods  I will carry out a randomised controlled trial. For this, 246 people living with chronic breathlessness will be recruited. Each person will be randomly chosen by a computer to get their usual care or usual care plus access to SELF-BREATHE. All study participants will complete questionnaires at the start of the study, thereafter at six weeks and six months.  These questionnaires will ask patients about 1) their breathlessness and its effect on their life and 2) planned and unplanned hospital visits. At the end of the study, I will compare answers to these questionnaires between the two groups at six weeks and six months.  This will tell if SELF-BREATHE improved patients' breathlessness and reduced their need for unplanned hospital visits e.g., A&E attendances due to breathlessness.     Patient and public involvement (PPI)  I have, and will continue to, actively work with PPI groups. This includes PPI groups within the Cicely Saunders Institute, Asthma and Lung UK, NIHR-Research Design Service- London and the Centre for Ethnic Health Research. PPI input to date includes development and early testing work of SELF-BREATHE and the writing of this application. PPI expertise has ensured the project is focused on what matters to them. PPI members will advise on study promotion, patient recruitment and develop trial resources (e.g., information sheets, recruitment posters). PPI members will be paid for their time.   Dissemination  Once the study ends, I will share the findings through journal articles for researchers and professionals, via patient facing websites and social media. I will hold a knowledge exchange event, bringing together patients, carers, health professionals and health service planners to reflect on the study results.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
C00885,A novel mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics screening,"Animal models of COVID-19 will play a critical role in developing and testing novel vaccines and therapies forthis disease, but a very limited number of models are currently available, and they suffer from substantiallimitations. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses human ACE2 to bind to cells, and the host TMPRSS2 protease toprime the viral spike proteins for entry. Three mouse strains expressing human ACE2 as a transgene exist-only one of which is being prepared for distribution in the US and is in high demand under the currentcircumstance. Furthermore, concerns exist about aberrant expression of human ACE2 in these mice, given thelack of normal regulatory elements, and none of the ACE2 transgenic strains express the human TMPRSS2protease, thus cannot be used to assess therapeutic strategies that target the protease. We propose toemploy a novel and rapid gene replacement strategy that we have pioneered, to generate ACE2 andTMPRSS2 gene replacement mice. Our BSL3 experienced team will infect these mice with SARS-CoV-2 inorder to determine if they display the expected viral replication, interstitial pneumonia, inflammatory cytokinestorm, and antibody responses that characterize human COVID-19 disease. Importantly, these mice will beimmediately sent to our partners at Jackson Labs (JAX) for rapid expansion and world-wide distribution.",1,1e
C15333,The Role of COVID-19 Endothelial Cell Dysfunction and Hypercoagulability in the Development of Post-ICU Cognitive Impairment and Dementia,"Project Summary/Abstract  About 5-8% of those who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2)  require intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization for severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. More than  80% of COVID-19 ICU patients develop delirium, an acute disorder of attention and cognition, placing them at  higher risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias (ADRD).  Research is urgently needed to identify novel therapeutic targets which may reduce the potential public health  burden of ICU delirium and subsequent ADRD from the COVID-19 pandemic. One such promising therapeutic  target may be endothelial cells, which can be directly infected by SARS CoV-2.  Endothelial cells line the blood vessels and play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation and blood  coagulation. When these endothelial cells are infected by SARS CoV-2, patients can develop acute inflammation  and changes in the blood to form blood clots throughout their various organs (also known as hypercoagulability).  However, a major knowledge gap is whether COVID-19 associated endothelial cell dysfunction can explain how  certain brain disorders, such as delirium and ADRD, arise in COVID-19 ICU patients. Studies are also needed  to understand whether inflammation and hypercoagulability from COVID-19 associated endothelial cell  dysfunction may explain the link between delirium and subsequent ADRD.  To answer these questions, we propose to conduct a prospective pilot study that will compare ICU patients  hospitalized for severe COVID-19 symptoms with ICU patients who are not infected with SARS CoV-2  hospitalized for acute respiratory failure and shock. The overall hypothesis is that endothelial infection with SARS  CoV-2 causes endothelial cell dysfunction and accompanying inflammation which, in turn, trigger a  hypercoagulable state. This COVID-19 associated pathophysiology initially manifests as ICU delirium, and  persists to cause ongoing cerebrovascular damage, neurodegeneration, and, finally, ADRD. The goal of this  proposal is to estimate the strength of these associations for the following aims that will be the groundwork for a  future R01 proposal: 1) examine the differences in endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation, and  hypercoagulability between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 ICU patients; 2) determine whether COVID-19  associated endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and hypercoagulability are associated with higher rates of ICU  delirium and/or MCI and ADRD; and 3) examine the relationship between COVID-19 associated endothelial cell  dysfunction, inflammation, and hypercoagulability and biomarkers of neurodegenerative disorders.",4,"4a, 4b"
C00973,High-throughput single-molecule protein identification via super-resolution imaging,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract SectionA technology capable of generating robust protein data across various biological states, with the sensitivity and coverage available to next-generation sequencing, would drastically change our understanding of cellular proteomes and ability to detect rare proteins in limited samples. Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for proteomics. However, it suffers from limited sensitivity (>10{6} molecules required) preventing the identification of low-abundance proteins and single-cellproteomics. A high-throughput single-molecule protein identification method remains a key technical challenge for the proteomic community. Addressing this challenge will dramatically improve the ability to discover and assay novel biomarkers, with transformative impact in our understanding of cancer, immunology and brain research. We propose a robust high-throughput strategy for single-molecule protein identification. This approach will be based on our recent technological breakthrough on developing the highly multiplexed (10-plex; Nature Methods 2014), precisely quantitative(>90% precision and accuracy; Nature Methods 2016), and ultra-high resolution (sub-5 nm; Nature Nanotechnology 2016) DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging method. Using DNA-PAINT to image a DNA-barcoded and stretched protein will provide a unique optical signature for accurate identification of any proteins in a complex mixture. This method will enable parallel identification of proteins with single-molecule sensitivity, resulting in broadly transformative impacts on fundamental and translational biomedical studies. To address the unmet testing need for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we will also work to develop a rapid diagnostics device.",1,1a

C06860,Data Disparities Supplement to Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic of unprecedented proportion. As of April 28, 2020, there were over3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, including over 1 million cases within the United States. Inaddition, there has been over 213,000 COVID-19 related deaths globally, including 57,000 deaths in the UnitedStates. The COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately impacting racial/ethnic minority communities, as well asthose who face socioeconomic disadvantage. Reasons for this disproportionate impact among racial/ethnicminorities include a greater burden of the chronic health conditions that place persons at risk of severe diseaseand death from COVID-19, poorer access to primary and specialty care, an increased risk of contractingCOVID-19 due to barriers to practicing social distancing behaviors, and shortages of testing resources indisadvantaged communities. This pandemic has presented unprecedented needs for timely access to health-related data. The State of Maryland and surrounding regions including the District of Columbia are fortunate tohave a well-functioning health information exchange, CRISP. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CRISP datahave the potential to serve an essential function in tracking and understanding the care and outcomes ofCOVID-19 infections. This resource would be unique among COVID registries in that it includes all healthevents and findings among the entire population of a geographic area, regardless where a health service wasdelivered. As such, it is ideally suited to address questions of health disparities. The Specific Aims of thisadministrative supplement are to (1) develop the CRISP data resource as a unique, population-based COVID-19 registry on the highly secure Johns Hopkins Precision Medicine Analytics Platform, and (2) evaluateCOVID-19 care and outcomes by race, neighborhood and socioeconomic status such that targeted strategiescan be deployed to reduce emerging disparities.","3, 4","3b, 4b"

P21615,Preclinical Development of a Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Vaccine,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne emerging pathogen that causes severe and  often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans across a broad geographic range that includes more than 30 countries.  The NIAID lists CCHFV as a Category A priority pathogen, a biological agent that poses the highest risk to  national security and public health. CCHF is of particular importance to public health as there are no licensed  vaccines or treatments available for use in humans, and because of the concern that the virus could be used as  an agent of biological terrorism. The goal of this project is to advance the development of a recombinant vaccine  based on next generation vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vectors expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein as a  potential medical countermeasure that can provide protection across all six genetically distinct clades of CCHFV.  This application proposes to develop and pre-clinically validate a rVSV vectored CCHF vaccine. Next generation  VesiculovaxÃ¢Â""Â¢ CCHF vaccines will be compared head-to-head with a prototype rVSV vaccine that has been  shown to completely protect animals against lethal CCHFV infection. Vaccines will be compared for  immunogenicity, lack of neurovirulence, and the ability to protect STAT-1 knockout mice against all six M  segment clades of CCHFV. A lead candidate vaccine will then be down selected. Supporting studies using a  newly developed lethal nonhuman primate model of CCHFV will be employed to confirm protective efficacy of  the lead vaccine candidate, assess the ability to the vaccine to provide rapid protection, and finally to begin to  determine correlates of protection. This proposal will draw together expertise in vaccine development, CCHFV  biology, and animal modeling needed to develop a vaccine that meets both the outbreak and bioweapon  scenarios that require rapid protection against all CCHFV clades with a single administration.",7,7a
C06349,Diagnostic and prognostic study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and influenza virus,"Introduction: The epidemics caused by the Influenza virus are recognized for their great impact on public health. The identification of a new coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) with pandemic spread has brought new challenges for diagnosis, control and therapy. The rapid and low-cost diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza infections may allow the adoption of measures to control transmissibility both in the environment of Health Units and isolation from social contact in the community. The early identification of patients with a higher risk of death also allows a targeted therapeutic approach with ventilatory support measures and the use of specific antivirals against these two viruses. The understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms related to the coagulation cascade, involved in the severe forms of involvement by respiratory viruses, proposed in this project, may lead to the development of new therapeutic possibilities in order to reduce the high lethality of this serious clinical situation. Objective: 1) Development of a method for rapid and low-cost diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza virus infections; 2) study of early prognostic factors in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza virus; 3) Study of platelet aggregation levels by Multiplate-ADP and coagulation in hospitalized patients due to respiratory distress. Method: 4 groups will be compared: SARS-CoV-2 infection patients, Influenza virus infection patients, influenza syndrome patients with negative tests for COVID-19 / Influenza virus and healthy controls. Patients with suspected flu-like symptoms (fever accompanied by one of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, runny nose, frontal headache with onset of symptoms in the last 7 days) will be enrolled in 2 public referral hospitals. Exclusion criteria: Age below 18 years. The healthy control group will consist of 50 volunteer health care professionals paired by sex and age to the group of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Peripheral blood, skin imprint and saliva samples will be collected from all individuals included in the study. Those who require hospitalization and present criteria for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will also be collected second and third samples of non-invasive specimens (skin imprint and saliva) 3 and 7 days after inclusion. Nasal flush will be collected for diagnosis of Influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection by the protocol only for those who do not perform these tests through the hospital routine. All samples will be sent for storage (- 80C) at the Virology Laboratory of USP's Institute of Tropical Medicine and UNICAMP's Innovare Laboratory. Metabolites will be studied by plasma mass spectrometry, skin and saliva imprint and analyzed by artificial intelligence. The diagnosis of infection by Influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 will be considered positive (gold standard) by positive molecular biology test in a nasal wash sample. Patients' prognosis will be assessed by the following outcomes: length of hospital stay, need for dialysis, need for orotracheal intubation or hospital death. Platelet aggregability will be studied using the Multiplate-TRAP and Multiplate-ASPI methods, reticulated platelet levels (young), mean platelet volume (MPV), P-selectin, D-dimer, PAI-1, Fibrinogen, Tromboxane, Tempo activated partial thromboplastin (PTTa), prothrombin time (TP); Type B natriuretric peptide (BNP); Ultrasensitive troponin, peak glycemia during hospitalization, lipid profile when hospitalized.","1, 4","1a, 4a, 4b"
C07206,University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute (UMN CTSI),"The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a project that is funded by NCATS to build a central registry of patients who have been tested for COVID-19 or have a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model is the representational format used in the full N3C repository.     This project proposes to develop a COVID-19 data extract from the University of Minnesota COVID-19 Registry by mapping it to the OMOP data model in order to support optimal participation in the N3C. The OMOP format will allow us to contribute all of our COVID-19 patient data at a level of detail necessary to study this disease.    The University of Minnesota has developed and maintains a CDR that contains the EHR records and ancillary data for 3M patients from affiliated clinics and hospitals of the M Health FairviewSystem. The CDR was created in 2012 and uses a proprietary data model developed at theUniversity of Minnesota which has served our researchers well. In 2017, Fairview HealthSystems merged with another healthcare organization, HealthEast. As of 2020, the HealthEastEHR has not been integrated into the overall Fairview Epic system and no HealthEast EHRrecords are available in the CDR. In March 2020, one of the HealthEast hospitals, Bethesda, was designated as the COVID hospital to treat COVID-19 ICU patients for the combined health system. Because of this, only 50% of our COVID-19 patients' data is available in the CDR.In order to serve the immediate needs of our COVID-19 researchers, a process for extracting COVID-19 related data from the HealthEast system into a University of Minnesota COVID-19 Registry has been implemented. The University of Minnesota has signed the N3C data transfer agreement and will begin participation by extracting data from our ACT i2b2 instance to the N3C. However, none of the HealthEast data is incorporated into our ACT i2b2 database. For complete participation, we propose to map the University of Minnesota COVID-19 Registry to OMOP in order to support optimal participation in the N3C. The OMOP data model provides the optimal mapping with the most detail and gives the N3C the most benefits from our data. This approach will also allow all of the HealthEast COVID-19 patient data to be included in a complete extract of all COVID-19 patients across our entire health system to the N3C with data represented at a level of detail necessary to study this disease.",11,11d
C19848,The Paradox of Precaution: Examining Public Health COVID-19 Outbreak Management Strategies,"In any outbreak, public health focuses on surveillance, containment, and providing recommendations for how the public can stay safe: wash hands, cover coughs, stay home when sick, and get vaccinated if one is available. While this is similar messaging to what is heard in cold/flu season, what separates these events apart is the inherent uncertainty involved during the emergence of a novel virus.   However, when public health best practice (e.g. quarantining returning nationals from Wuhan) is attacked as putting people in ""medical jails"", or when the WHO implores governments for emergency resources to manage the outbreak by declaring the novel virus as ""public enemy number one"" akin to a ""global threat potentially worse than terrorism"", it creates a paradox around the concept of precaution. There is an urgent need to examine the cultural, social and political responses to the management of the current outbreak in real time.  The objectives of this research are: 1) to evaluate how cautionary public health messages for the outbreak are presented by the news media; 2) to evaluate whether public health agencies are using social media and how well these tools, if used, increase public understanding of these outbreaks; 3) to assess how members of the general public, including special targeted groups, understand the outbreak, both the risks of disease and the risks of contraction; 4) to evaluate how effectively members of the public feel they can protect themselves given public health outbreak communication, and how they make sense of this relative to seasonal influenza risk messaging; and 5) to assess public response to a novel vaccine if one becomes available.  We will meet these objectives through a content analysis of news media stories / social media, and interviews with public health communication leads (objs 1&2) and focus groups/surveys with members of the general public and targeted communities (e.g. Indigenous peoples, Asians) in select Canadian cities (objs 3-5).",9,"9a, 9c"

Many lack support and are given conflicting advice.      Aim:   To work out which treatments are most likely to benefit people with particular symptoms and test supportive treatments to improve their quality of life.       Design and methods    Work package 1 will identify people that had COVID-19 from GP records.  Study participants will be invited to use a digital platform to report Long COVID symptoms/quality of life.       Work package 2 will assess Long COVID symptoms. Participants with severe symptoms will be contacted by a nurse to provide advice/support. Blood test results and wearable data will help us understand which treatments might be best to support specific groups of Long COVID patients.       Work package 3 will review evidence for treatments for Long COVID including drugs or supportive interventions (e.g. for mental health or tiredness). Working with patients, doctors and other experts we will recommend treatments that should be tested in Long COVID patients and develop supportive interventions which can be delivered using the Long COVID platform.      Work package 4 will establish a digital trial using the Long COVID platform to test whether supportive interventions can benefit Long COVID patients by reducing their symptoms and improving their quality of life and if the intervention is good value for money.

C06339,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs): importance in pathogenesis and potential therapeutic target in COVID-19,"2019 coronavirus disease (Covid19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has become a major health problem worldwide. The pulmonary changes observed in patients with Covid-19 are characterized by intense damage to epithelial and endothelial cells, viral replication in lung tissue and extensive inflammatory process characterized by edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and increased tissue concentrations of inflammatory cytokines , such as TNF- ±, IL-1 and IL-6. In addition to pulmonary changes, there is also a systemic inflammatory response with important lesions in other organs such as kidneys, heart and intestines. Recent studies suggest that neutrophils participate in lung injuries and possibly in other organs, but it is not yet clear what mechanisms are involved. Among the cytotoxic mediators released by this cell type are free radicals, enzymes and NETs (from Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) or, simply, extracellular traps of neutrophils, which are networks of DNA conjugated with antimicrobial enzymes such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase and citrullinated histones. NETs are described as one of the main mediators responsible for injuries seen in several autoimmune diseases and also in vital organs during sepsis. However, the involvement of NETs in the injuries observed at Covid-19 remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of the present project is to identify the participation of NETs in the pathogenesis of Covid-19. The possible involvement of NETs in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 will allow us to propose new therapeutic approaches for this disease, that is, drugs that degrade this mediator and / or inhibit its synthesis. In this sense, we are also proposing to conduct an open clinical trial treating patients with Covid-19 with Pulmozyme. Pulmozyme is used in the clinic to treat cystic fibrosis and its active ingredient is DNAs that degrade NETs. Confirming the feasibility of the project, in a preliminary experiment, we observed an exacerbated production of NETs by isolated neutrophils and in the plasma of patients affected with Covid-19.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
C06120,Identifying Immune Targets to treat severe COVID-19 lung disease (IT-COVID-19),"While most patients recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation with a high mortality of 20-30%. This progression might be due to an overwhelming immune reaction. Thus, reducing the hyperinflammation seems to be an ideal therapeutic approach.    However, considering the functional heterogeneity of the immune cells, it remains unclear which of the major immune players is the optimal target for a COVID-19 therapy. This is essential, since targeting the wrong immune players might even worsen the disease. Our main hypothesis is that the major detrimental immunological player is a specific population of pathological T cells and that selectively blocking these cells or their bioproducts, (e.g. cytokines, chemokines) will provide a cure for severe COVID-19 patients.     We will use our established workflows to perform single-cell RNA-/ TCR-sequencing of lung-infiltrating leukocytes with a focus on T cells and parenchymal lung cells in severe COVID-19. The data analysis will reveal the functional heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and establish the pathological interactions between the immune cells and parenchymal lung infected versus non infected cells. Finally, we will test the function of the potential disease-driving cells and/or bioproducts using a recently established airway organoid system.    The immediate impact of this project will be a COVID-19 immune atlas which will be key to choose the best target for the already available immune therapies to treat COVID-19 patients in the coming months.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
P22443,Transcriptome engineering technologies for the development of antiviral effectors in mosquitoes,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Billions of people are at risk of contracting vector-borne diseases and there are no drugs or vaccines to treat or  prevent the majority of these infections. Therefore, vector control is the primary tool used for vector-borne  disease prevention. This proposal aims to improve the technologies available to conduct functional analysis of  genes in Ã¢Â€Â<Ae. aegyptiÃ¢Â€Â<, a major vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. Additionally, these same  tools can be adapted to develop antiviral effectors for genetic population replacement strategies, which could  be a key tool for the sustainable management of vector-borne disease. While the goal of creating functional  analytic tools for mosquitoes is not novel, the proposed RNA guided, RNA targeting endonuclease tools will  likely be a more efficient technology with less off target effects compared to current RNAi screening  technologies. Furthermore, we use these new technologies to develop antiviral effectors for the development  of disease refractory mosquitoes, which will expect to be an efficient alternative to current RNAi-based antiviral  effectors. Therefore, this project will adapt RNA guided, RNA targeting Cas endonucleases to develop  functional transcriptomic tools and novel post-transcriptional and viral RNA silencing strategies in Ã¢Â€Â<Ae. aegyptiÃ¢Â€Â<.  The tools will be first developed in mosquito cells and then transitioned into an Ã¢Â€Â<in vivo Ã¢Â€Â<mosquito model.  Comparative analysis of the efficiency of RNA guided, RNA targeting Cas endonuclease tools, RNAi and Cas9  functional Ã¢Â€ÂœomicsÃ¢Â€Â tools will also be conducted to determine the most robust RNA silencing and functional  genomic analytical strategies. Finally, these tools will be designed to target viral RNA in mosquito cells and in  the whole organism. In the end, we will develop a functional transcriptomics tool that will facilitate the  characterization of Ã¢Â€Â<Ae. aegypti Ã¢Â€Â<genes as well as the development of novel antiviral effectors.",2,2b

C09980,Exploring the psychological drivers and impact of public health communications on vaccination beliefs of minority ethnic groups,"Psychological drivers of behaviour can help explain why individuals engage in protective and risky health behaviours. Understanding behavioural determinants can inform strategies to promote behaviour change and using a theory-driven approach underpinned by behavioural science, facilitates a more detailed understanding of mechanisms of change. Evidence indicates some minority ethnic groups have lower intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This is of considerable concern given higher COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality among minority ethnic groups. There is limited evidence of the reasons underpinning COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in minority ethnic groups in the UK, but emerging evidence indicates it is related to beliefs about vaccine safety/efficacy and issues of mistrust towards formal services, as well as practical barriers such as access. This study will involve three waves of in-depth interviews and focus groups with minority ethnic community members and organisations in London and Birmingham to understand (i) specific barriers and facilitators of vaccine uptake, (ii) changes in COVID-19 vaccination risk perceptions over time, (iii) challenges and strategies for building and sustaining community support for vaccination programmes, and (iv) the impact of public health campaigns on vaccination intention. We will also evaluate national and local campaigns across the UK to identify mechanisms of action of health messages using a behavioural science framework. This will facilitate the rapid development of evidence-based, theoretically informed, tailored health messages that are critical for the ongoing success of the UK mass vaccination programme. It will also support the sustained community engagement that is crucial for optimising public health outcomes.",9,9d
C03143,A systematic review on the effectiveness of virtual sleep intervention delivery to improve sleep and mental health outcomes in the post-secondary student population.,"Students pursuing post-secondary education (e.g., college/university) are a population group at risk for both significant sleep problems and poor mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety. Interventions such as sleep hygiene education and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are commonly used treatment options for sleep problems and have been effective in improving sleep and mental health in the university student population. Digitally-delivered CBT has also shown to be effective in improving sleep in youth, however it has not been evaluated in the post-secondary population. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many industries, including mental health services, were forced to close to comply with physical distancing measures. In an effort to address the growing sleep challenges faced by students, some institutions have moved to providing care through a virtual platform. However, the effectiveness of delivering sleep interventions virtually to the post-secondary population is unknown. Given this paucity of information - especially in a climate that may be forced to embrace virtual care options for service delivery in perpetuity as we slowly enter a 'new normal', we propose a systematic review of the literature to synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological sleep interventions delivered through a technology-based platform. Our review will provide knowledge users with a synthesis of the best available evidence to inform decision making when developing interventions to be delivered through virtual platforms. Moreover, as the COVID-19 situation develops, this synthesis allows us to be proactive in adapting a new way to deliver mental health services (e.g., virtual care).",10,10a
C07227,High-Throughput Dried Blood Spot (HT-DBS) Technologies in SARS COV-2 Serology and Vaccinology,"Project Summary: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the United States it is imperative that we implement technologies to screen large swaths of the population for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serological surveillance not only affords a measure of virus exposure within a community at large but also provides information necessary to predict outbreak dynamics. Furthermore, as our understanding of how humoral factors contribute to controlling (and possibly exacerbating) COVID-19, it will be essential to have methods in place to measure the ""quantity"" and ""quality"" of antibodies associated with both natural SARS-CoV-2 exposure and candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.     This U01 proposal seeks to advance the use of dried bloodspots (DBS) in conjunction with a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to enable high-throughput (HT) population-wide serological surveillance for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the proposal will expand the HT-DBS assay to capture the breadth and complexity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses following natural infection, and develop a high-throughput competitive immunoassay (CIA) as a surrogate measure of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in DBS. The proposed platform technologies to be developed at theWadsworth Center will contribute directly to NCI's mission to ""... develop, validate, improve and implementserological testing and associated technologies..."" to address the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,"1a, 1d"
P25552,Surpassing Symptomatology: Exploring Posttraumatic Growth in MDMA-Facilitated Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating illness that impacts almost 1 in 10 Canadians in their lifetime. Individuals suffering from PTSD are at risk for suicide, other mental illnesses, and poor health outcomes. Yet, PTSD is not a solitary disorder. PTSD also impacts the mental health of loved ones. For this reason, Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) treats the patient and their partner. After this therapy, a majority of patients no longer meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. However, symptom reduction is not the only measure of treatment success. Positive changes matter. Posttraumatic growth (or improvements in multiple areas of life following a trauma) can occur as stronger interpersonal relationships, personal strength, appreciation of life, seeing new possibilities, and spiritual change. It has been shown that CBCT can lead to posttraumatic growth. Yet, not all patients respond to treatment or show positive changes, and ways to improve therapies are needed. The drug 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has shown remarkable promise when combined with psychotherapy; and MDMA has been named a breakthrough therapy for PTSD. However, no study has examined if posttraumatic growth occurs in MDMA-assisted couples therapy for PTSD. In this study, 40 couples will receive either MDMA-assisted CBCT or CBCT. We hope to uncover if posttraumatic growth increases for patients and partners in MDMA-assisted CBCT compared to CBCT, when posttraumatic growth occurs in therapy sessions, and to understand the lived experience for patients and partners longer term. To answer these questions, we will measure posttraumatic growth before and after therapy, examine therapy session tapes, and interview patients and partners 6 months after therapy. This will be the first study to examine posttraumatic growth in MDMA-facilitated couples therapy for PTSD. Given that the FDA has scheduled MDMA to become a medicine by 2021, this research is necessary and timely.",4,4e
C10740,"The Canadian Severe Acute Respiratory Infection, Prospective, Perpetual Observational Study: Informing Clinical Care and the Public Health Response","Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is a major public health problem. The commonest cause of SARI is influenza which is responsible for substantial illness and death each year, in addition to outbreaks and periodic pandemics. Recent outbreaks of pandemic influenza viruses and coronaviruses such as COVID-19, have taught us not only that these viruses can lead to severe illness and death, but also that it can take a long time between the start of an outbreak and when the health care system knows enough about the illness to guide public health policy and clinical care. Each year since 2016, with a network of hospitals and infectious diseases and critical care clinicians, we have described severe respiratory infection in Canadian hospitals, the viruses and bacteria that cause people to get sick, their treatments and how often it leads to patients needing critical care or dying. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, this team of over 50 adult and children's hospitals worked in collaboration with the World Health Organization and partners in other countries to describe severe illness from this new virus. We found that patients were typically older, more commonly men and often had pre-existing medical problems. Of patients who were sick enough to need admission to the intensive care unit, about one-quarter unfortunately still died; however, this is a much lower death rate than in many other countries hit hard by the pandemic. This ongoing study will describe whether patterns of illness change in the second and subsequent pandemic waves, and will provide a way to rapidly study common and new respiratory infections in the future to inform policy and practice.",4,4b

Theextent and urgency of the situation requires an aggressive and innovative approach to accelerate the deliveryof solutions to address immediate and future needs. Our approach augments the strong technical and clinicalexpertise within our own and the existing four POCTRN centers and their Coordinating Center. The specificaims are: 1) develop a SARS-CoV-2 ten-minute molecular diagnostic test based on the Minute MolecularPlatform; and 2) scale up C-THAN's established international network for COVID-19 technologicaldevelopment and testing of relevant products and assays in sub-Saharan Africa and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For aim 1, C-THAN proposes the development of a ten-minute SARS-CoV-2 testfor the Minute Molecular DASH (Diagnosis Analyzer for Selective Hybridization), a sample-to-answer platformfor point-of-care use in medical clinics, emergency departments and urgent care centers. The DASH platformexploits novel fast PCR and microfluidic fabrication technologies developed at the Center for innovation inGlobal Health Technologies (CIGHT) at Northwestern University. DASH technology can be adapted for highthroughput uses such as airports, hospitals, nursing homes, emergency departments and drive-through testingsites. For aim 2, we will scale up C-THAN resources to expand addressing the impact of the pandemic. TheC-THAN network consists of four biomedical engineering (BME) technology development sites plus threeclinical validation/needs assessment sites. The BME sites include University of Cape Town and StellenboschUniversity in South Africa, and University of Lagos and University of Ibadan in Nigeria. The seven clinicalvalidation/needs assessment sites include ones located with the engineering sites plus at University of Jos inNigeria, University of Bamako in Mali and Muhimbili University in Tanzania. The relationship of these sites withNorthwestern University go back up to 22 years. We will utilize Northwestern's Institute for Global HealthCatalyzer Award Program which has been funding promising research projects addressing critical global healthneeds for over 10 years. Two weeks ago, the Institute redirected all proposals to address only COVID-19activities. Basic scientists, biomedical engineers, infectious diseases specialists, virologist, pharmacologistsand public health faculty are encouraged to apply for Catalyzer awards which are in the range of $25,000 for aone-year project. With this POCTRN supplement, we will ""plus-up"" these awards to a maximum of $100,000each to increase the scope and pace of the development. Applications are being accepted on a rolling basis,and funding decisions are made within 7 days. These two approaches will rapidly accelerate the developmentof promising COVID-19 technologies both in the US and globally.",1,1a
C02359,Cultural policy during and after the pandemic: international insights into the recovery of the performing arts sector,"Before Covid-19, the cultural sector was already in crisis - precarious labour conditions, intersectional inequalities and insufficient public funding, particularly but not exclusively in the global South. Now, performing artists have been hit hardest due to venue closures, restrictions in public space and the fact that many cannot perform to digital audiences. While public emergency funding helps cultural workers and arts organisations, its scope and impact vary internationally across socio-economic and institutional contexts as well as different approaches to lockdown. Through in-depth interviews, focus groups and policy workshops with performing artists in the UK and Argentina, together with secondary analysis of ongoing surveys, the project will examine how the pandemic is affecting cultural workers from a sociological perspective. By discussing the work strategies that 80 musicians, actors, dancers and circus artists are now deploying, suggestions will be made about how cultural policy can best support the recovery of the sector.",10,10d
P21743,A modular platform for infectious disease surveillance at point-of-need.,"ABSTRACT  We propose to develop a point-of-need system for differential molecular identification of filoviruses from  syndromically similar infections. Our goal is to enable rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of quarantinable  infections to reduce nosocomial risk and improve outbreak response. The platform will simultaneously test 12  genomic markers at the genus and strain level using a modular microfluidic design that allows for rapid panel  update and expansion. In Phase I we will develop an assay for pan-filovirus (pFi), followed by expansion of the  panel and system integration in Phase II. The expanded panel will add pan-flavivirus (pFa) and pan-Plasmodium  (pPa) detection as well as strain-specific targets for Ebola, Marburg, Dengue, Yellow Fever, and Malaria. Strain  specific tests will enable better patient triage/treatment during an outbreak and improve disease surveillance in  non-outbreak settings.  The panel will require a 50 ÃŽÂ¼L sample of whole blood and will achieve highly specific detection in < 30 minutes.  To achieve this goal, we will combine Redbud LabsÃ¢Â€Â™ expertise in microfluidics and systems with the diagnostic  development expertise of the Diagnostics Program at PATH (Seattle, WA), and the VHF testing/processing  capabilities of the Connor Lab at Boston University (part of the BSL-4 facilities at NEIDL).",1,1a
P22118,Essential early events in the flavivirus lifecycle,"Project Summary  Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika  virus, are a major cause of human disease. We are studying the early, post-fusion and pre-replication  events in the flavivirus lifecycle by using the prototype flavivirus, YFV, as our model. Our overarching  hypothesis is that flaviviruses, which alternately replicate in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, have  evolved to use i) highly conserved factors shared between hosts; and ii) multiple, redundant factors  that may not be well conserved between hosts. Therefore, discoveries made with YFV will be  validated and studied by comparison to other flaviviruses and between human and mosquito cells.  Aim 1 focuses on the post-fusion process of nucleocapsid uncoating, dissecting the mechanisms by  which cells unlock this fateful cargo. Aim 1 is a logical extension of our Preliminary Data showing that  the delivery of a translatable YFV genome requires cellular ubiquitylation and VCP/p97, a cellular  ATPase that extracts ubiquitylated proteins from large macromolecular complexes. Aim 2 focuses on  identifying the cellular protease(s) that cleave the viral NS1-2A polyprotein intermediate. Cleavage is  essential for flavivirus replication (shown here), yet the identity of this protease has remained elusive  for over two decades. We have identified a small family of related candidate NS1-2A proteases and  are validating their activity by rigorous, combinatorial genetic ablation. These efforts will solve long-  standing puzzles in flavivirus gene expression and replication and identify targets for future  development of broadly acting antivirals.",1,"1b, 1e"
P22264,Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.,"Monitoring mosquito ecosystems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical  sensor.   PI: B. Thomas Ã¢Â€Â"" NIH R21  Project Summary:   Vector control strategies remain one of the most effective ways to protect human populations from the  large number of mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, zika virus, or West Nile virus.  Mosquito populations are generally monitored using physical traps, however this method suffers from many  disadvantages. It requires long and expensive laboratory analysis by qualified personnel which drastically  reduces the number of observed insects as well as time of trap deployment. Traps also provide a poor estimate  of the actual population size or population density because the attractive range of traps is generally unknown  and may change with weather conditions. These limitations are strong drawbacks in our ability to evaluate the  effectiveness of various types of vector-control strategies (chemicals, biological, environmental modifications  etc.). Inferior methods are not necessarily identified which ultimately contributes to the spread of infectious  diseases. In this context, we argue that new methodologies to monitor insect population dynamics is key in the  necessary effort to improve control program performance.   A team from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Hudson Mosquito  Program seeks support to carry out a series of field experiments using a new optical sensor capable of  identifying in real-time the family, species, and gender of mosquitoes in its field of view. The laser-based  instrument is a dual-wavelength polarization-sensitive stand-off sensor. For each flying insect transiting  through the infrared laser beams, the sensor can retrieve the optical properties of the wings and body of the  insect as well as its wing beat frequency. Preliminary data from a laboratory prototype and numerical  simulations indicate that the instrument, using a supervised machine learning classifier, can identify the  species, gender, and gravidity of mosquitoes up to 300 m away. The instrument will be deployed in a high  mosquito density area in New Jersey to continuously monitor the mosquito population over the whole season  from April to October 2021. Continuous measurements will allow to identify a number of insects that is orders  a magnitude higher than physical traps. As the probed volume of air is known, data analysis will provide the  population density for each class of insects from which the population dynamics will be derived. In addition,  the time and date of each insect transit allow to study the circadian rhythm, peak activities, and behavior as a  function of atmospheric conditions measured by a weather station. In 2022, a similar experiment will be  conducted at the same location while the Hudson Mosquito Program will conduct a vector control campaign  targeting Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, both responsible for the spread of various infectious diseases. The  impact of multiple applications of airborne pyrethroid insecticide on targeted and non-targeted insects will be  evaluated by studying the mortality rates and population dynamics for each species. Both years, the data will be  compared to physical traps on site, the current gold standard method, for further analysis and validation.",2,"2b, 2c"

C06830,Prenatal Exposures and Child Health Outcomes:  A Statewide Study,"Project Summary: Evidence from epidemiologic studies demonstrates the negative effects of both chronic and acute stress duringgestation. These effects may occur perinatally or later in the child's life. The COVID-19 global pandemic has ledto unprecedented mass disruption of social and financial security as well as changes in medical care delivery.These conditions are causing elevated levels of distress even for portions of the population that may havepreviously been protected from psychosocial stress. Of particular concern for pregnant women and their children,there may be direct biological effects related to infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as substantial indirectpsychosocial effects during critical periods of development with long-lasting impact on children relevant to theEnvironmental Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. This proposal addresses how psychosocial stressrelated to the COVID pandemic may impact perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Furthermore, evidencesuggests that psychosocial stress is associated with both the gastrointestinal and vaginal microbiomes.Therefore, we will determine if maternal microbiomes or infant microbiomes mediate the impact of psychosocialstress on perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes. In aim 1, we address the maternal microbes and theirrole in mediating perinatal outcomes caused by maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy. In aim 2, wefocus on maternal psychosocial stress and its impact on neurodevelopment as mediated by the changes to theinfant microbiota. We will examine these objectives in the context of our ongoing work, and as an extension ofthe parent grant (UG3/UH3OD023285, Paneth), where our organizing principle is that for many environmentalexposures the most sensitive period of risk for child health is pregnancy and the perinatal period. The parentgrant explores three primary exposures: toxic, nutritional, and inflammatory in a stratified random sample of statebirths recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy. Of the planned 1,100 new enrollments of cohort dyads intoECHO, more than 700 pregnant women have been consented, and, with a 75% follow up rate, more than 400children have already been seen in infancy. Over 300 women are expected to be enrolled during the projectperiod. While this research will leverage the local ECHO cohort, the project is designed to engage ECHO teamscience through two distinct but complementary ECHO-wide projects: (1) incorporation of data from two cohorts(O'Conner & Deoni) to address the aims proposed above and (2) provision of data and biospecimens to separateCOVID supplement (Transande) which addresses SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity/COVID illness as well aspsychosocial stress (assessed via questionnaire and cortisol measured in hair) as they relate to shortenedgestation and other perinatal outcomes. Our efforts will not only inform the specific hypotheses being tested butwill also inform ""touch-free"" methods for sample collection and patient interaction. The work proposed hereincomplements the parent grant by addressing an exposure (maternal psychosocial stress during a time ofpandemic), not included in the parent grant, and at least two of ECHO's outcomes (PPP and neurodevelopment).",10,10a
P23073,PUERTO RICO ENHANCED SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL OF ARBOVIRUSES (PRESCA) PROGRAM,"PROJECT SUMMARY   The impact of infections transmitted by mosquitoes is global. Arboviral diseases such as dengue,  chikungunya, and Zika are a significant health concern due to the expanding geographical range of many  mosquito species. Emphasis on disease surveillance systems is central to evaluate the effectiveness of primary  and secondary dengue prevention methods and strategies, including the introduction of dengue vaccines and  new vector control methods. In the current application, the study team will address specific and fundamental  gaps in the diagnosis and clinical management of dengue and other acute febrile illnesses (AFI); ultimately,  evaluating the efficacy of vector control strategies in reducing the incidence of arbovirus infection through a  combination of both clinic- and community-based surveillance systems. The study teamÃ¢Â€Â™s long-term goal is to  mitigate arboviral and other AFI disease burdens by improving diagnosis, clinical management, and prevention  strategies. The studyÃ¢Â€Â™s central hypothesis is that arbovirus infections and AFI disease surveillance, through the  continuation of SEDSS and COPA, will promote evidence-driven public health policy decisions and reduce the  burden of disease. The rationale for the current study is that understanding the etiology, epidemiology, and  severity of arboviral diseases will allow the United States to be better prepared and respond to critical vector-  borne disease outbreaks. The study team will test the central hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1)  Explore the natural history of dengue and arboviral infections and other acute febrile illnesses in their differential  diagnosis to understand their epidemiology, spectrum of disease, and outcomes to provide recommendations  for diagnosis and clinical management, and; 2) Define the correlates of risk and protection of arbovirus  transmission in the setting of vector-reduction strategies. Under Specific Aim 1, the team will strengthen hospital  surveillance of acute febrile illness (AFI) and maintain an AFI platform for conducting clinical research. For  Specific Aim 2, the team will maintain a community-based cohort to assess the incidence and prevalence of  arboviral infection, as well as, evaluate the incidence, prevalence, and etiology of other AFIs in selected  communities. Central to both aims is the establishment of a data management system and the continuation of  strengthening collaborations with the local government, community leaders, and other stakeholders to ensure  continuity of the established program. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to deliver  robust and broad knowledge regarding the epidemiologic patterns of common arboviral diseases in the context  of other AFI of the present and those that may emerge in the geographical setting. Such results provide evidence-  based responses to critical questions regarding dengue (and other arboviruses) diagnosis, immune response,  and clinical management. Also, the community-based system will be central to evaluate the efficacy of vector  control strategies in reducing the incidence of arboviral diseases in humans and assessing its potential use  among other populations.","3, 4","3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b"
C14331,GCRF_NF437  High Performance Low Cost Ventilator (HPLV) project,"The unmet need addressed by the High Performance Low-cost Ventilator (HPLV) project is the shortage of ventilators for patient care in OECD DAC list countries. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted this lack of ventilators which is in-turn compounded by a shortage of trained staff available to operate them. Beyond COVID-19, there remain the critical requirements of caring for pneumonia patients and others suffering from acute respiratory conditions in the OECD DAC-list countries. This project takes as its starting point the HEV (High Energy physics Ventilator) developed by the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva with advice and guidance from WHO with the aim of being suitable for OECD DAC list use. HEV has been developed using techniques routinely used in the context of CERN research, including for delivery and regulation of gases, and for sophisticated monitoring and control. Nevertheless, HEV was designed to be reasonably priced, robust, easily maintained and able to operate in an environment where oxygen supply pressure is variable, power is unreliable and few trained staff are available. The result is a resilient and simple design with comprehensive in-built options for remote training, monitoring, and operation, which does not compromise on either performance or functionality, but allows easy operation via a multi-lingual user interface. Within this HPLV project, partners in Brazil will identify local difficulties encountered when ventilating patients and input that information to the design team working on re-engineering the HEV ventilator into an HPLV design. Regulatory experts in the UK will also provide valuable guidance on this re-engineering activity. As well as re-engineering an HPLV prototype in line with real-world advice from Brazil, the HPLV project team will provide the necessary documentation to accompany the HPLV design, such that it is ready for regulatory approval. This is a key milestone to enabling commercial organisations to bridge the gap between prototyping and manufacture for use in a medical environment. The end point of this project will be reached when the new re-engineered HPLV prototype has been successfully tested in Brazil and the technical file is available for companies to use when they license the design for manufacture and sale to OECD DAC list users.",4,4c
C15284,How the Novel Coronavirus Attacks the Brain,"Presentations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are varied and unique in their neurological  manifestations, including loss of smell, confusion, and altered mental status, when the course of the novel  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is complicated by insults to the neurological system. The nasopharynx and  nasal cavities are reservoirs for high viral load and olfactory tissue contains key receptors and proteases that  may facilitate viral entry and replication at the cellular level. Downstream mechanisms of brain cellular  invasion and integration remain poorly understood, particularly how SARS-CoV-2 may be instigating diffuse  neurological effects. Patients with COVID-19 sustain a severe cytokine storm, the interplay between  inflammation and coagulation combined with endothelial damage, may lead to thrombo-embolic events, and  microglia activation leading to neuronal damage. Patients also present with long-term brain sequela of  COVID-19, including ""brain fog,"" difficulties concentrating, impaired short-term and working memory, fatigue,  headache, dysautonomia, and insomnia, and the neuropathological bases of these symptoms are unknown.  Appropriate evaluation of specific brain regions from deceased patients with COVID-19 who did and did not  present with neurological symptoms will allow for improved comprehension of possible targets to limit brain  damage. Additionally, lessons from how SARS-CoV-2 affects the brain may provide insight into generalizable  mechanisms for effects of neuroinflammation on neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to determine:  1. Whether COVID-19 patients with neurological presentations at the time of intake (NP-COVs) have altered  brain expression of genes regulating inflammation and coagulation compared to those without (COVs) and  non-COVID-19 age and sex matched controls (CONT). We will map the whole transcriptome in the entire  brain tissue section using single nuclei RNA sequencing (sn-RNA-seq, 10X Genomics). We will validate and  quantify candidate mRNAs expression on neurons, glia, and vasculature-associated cells, using Duplex  RNAscope® (ACDBio), as we successfully performed in CONT. 2. Whether NP-COVs have elevated brain  pro-inflammatory markers. We will run a Human Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor Panel (48 Plex Kit,  Milliopre) and quantify cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. We will map their expression on neurons  and glia, using double immunohistochemistry (IHC), as we piloted in CONT. 3. If NP-COVs have elevated  brain microglia activation. Using double-IHC for microglia markers TSPO (translocator protein), CD11b, Iba1  (Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule), and neuronal markers, and stereology for cell quantification, we  will compute activated (amoeboid) and resting (small cell body and elaborated thin processes) microglia, and  map spatial relationship to neurons. 4. If NP-COVs have reduced neuronal density and dendrite arborization.  Using double-IHC for neuronal marker NeuN and neurofilament, Stereoinvestigator and Neurolucida (MBF  Inc.), will quantify neuron density, dendrite length and arborization, as in our pilot studies.",4,"4a, 4b"
C09633,Assessing the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Internally Displaced Persons Camp in Northern Nigeria,"Project Title:  Assessing the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Internally Displaced Persons Camp in Northern Nigeria    Background  Over 2 million people are displaced in Nigeria as a result of Boko Haram Terrorist that have been engaged in an armed conflict with the Federal Republic of Nigeria for close to two decades. Consequently, many migrants live below the poverty line and are at risk of facing dire health consequences due to the fact that many of them are disadvantaged and marginalized. While some studies on the response to the novel coronavirus pandemic among people living with disabilities, individuals in urban settings and among the elderly population, there have been no studies on barriers and drivers to uptake and adherence to preventive public health measures in humanitarian settings such as Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. After searching eight (8) databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS, HINARI, CINAHL, JURN, DOAJ, and Web of Science), I have found no single original study on this area. Knowing about the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in these fragile regions will help in informing public health interventions and policies and will assist these vulnerable communities during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and also for future pandemic and public health emergency response in this region.    The priority of this study is supported by a commentary by Dahab and colleagues1 where they identified the following reasons for an urgent response to the pandemic in humanitarian settings such as internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.    1. Increase likelihood of coronavirus transmission due to larger family size, overcrowded IDP camps, poor water and hygienic practices and increased social gatherings   2. Greater chance for the progression of the covid-19 infection to progress to severe condition in these region due to an higer prevalence of noncommunnicable comorbidities eg HIV, TB, malnutrition, etc  3. Greater probability for these vulnerable people to die if they need specialized healthcare services which is not readily available due to lack of intensive care services in these region which are often located outside the major citities.[1]    Our focus is to identify both the barriers and drivers to uptake and adherence to prevention public measures such as social distancing, hand washing, etc among the internally displaced persons during the present coronavirus pandemic.    The findings of this project will be greatly influential in providing the evidence base needed in national, regional, and continental health policies in the African continent especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Also, the project is important in providing great insight into the health burden of vulnerable population in two African countries (Ethiopia and Nigeria) which will provide the necessary evidence for the international non-governmental organization, foreign agencies, multinational companies, philanthropic bodies, and external government agencies to provide funding, support, and partnership to African communities, regions, and countries to help promote health and wellbeing within the great African continent.    Research Question  What are the barriers and drivers to uptake and adherence to public health prevention measures among internally displaced persons in conflicting regions in Northern Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic?    Objectives  1.	To determine the barriers to uptake of public health prevention measures  2.	To investigate the barriers to adherence to public health prevention measures  3.	To assess the drivers to the uptake of public health prevention measures  4.	To determine the drivers to the uptake of public health prevention measures  5.	To assess the effectiveness of developed tools and evidence-based strategies and tools that can enable uptake and adherence to prevention measures in humanitarian settings      STUDY DESIGN and Approach Used to Maximise Research Output    A mixed-method cross-sectional study will be utilized in order to ensure the collection of both comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data on the topic of interest. Participants would be chosen across internally displaced persons' camps in northern Nigeria using a multistage sampling technique.     The list of the IDP camps to be used for the study in the chosen regions would be chosen randomly using a combination of systematic random sampling and simple random sampling (fish bowl technique). While participants for the quantitative part of the study would be selected via consecutive random sampling, participants for the qualitative part would be recruited from the quantitative one that was earlier done to further explore the situation, as those interested would be encouraged to indicate interest.    A minimum of 700 participants would be recruited for the qualitative component and 50 for the qualitative component. The qualitative component will involve 7 focus group discussions (involving a maximum of 6 people) and 15 Key in-depth/informant interviews.     Qualitative data would be collected (with the help of 4 trained research assistants) through the use of questionnaires adapted from similar gold standard questionnaires with very good psychometric properties, on the uptake, and adherence to preventive measures for infectious diseases.  Also, the focus guide along with the guide for the KII would also be prepared from similar ones in high-impact journals. Additionally, tools would be created in consultation with stakeholders and key organizations working with migrants and refugees. Face validity, content validity, inter-rater and intra-rater validity of the developed tools would also be assessed by the research teams. The key variables would include sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, religion, location of the camp, occupation, marital status, financial status, etc).  The questionnaires plus focus and key informant interview guide would also assess for factors responsible for uptake and adherence to preventive measures along with the barriers.     Analysis Plan  The qualitative data from the Focused group discussion and Indepth interviews would be analyzed thematically using  Nvivo software.  Quantitative data would be analyzed using both descriptive (mean, mode, standard deviation, charts, maps) and inferential (confidence interval, chi-square, independent T-test, Kruskawalis (ANOVA)) statistical tools using Microsoft Excel, Epi Info (for data entry majorly), and SPSS software.     Expected Outcome  1.	Identification of barriers and drivers to both uptake and adherence to public health preventive measures by internally displaced persons  2.	Development of support for the public health response to individuals living in humanitarian support during the current COVID-19 pandemic an also for future epidemics, pandemics, and other public health emergencies  3.	Development of a sound and solid research paper to be published in a very high impact journal such as JAMA, The Lancet, BMC journals that will be  easily accessible to governmental agencies, NGOs, donors, etc to facilitate appropriate and evidence-based response to individuals in humanitarian settings    Further outcomes  1.	These findings of this study would be published as an original research in a high impact journal such as The Lancet. Hence, it can be used in systematic reviews and meta-analysis that inform decisions. Also, being in a high impact journal, it will be easily accessible to policymakers and stakeholders working in the humanitarian field can make use of it for various advocacy, research, and innovation projects.  2.

C02343,Modelling the dynamics of viral load to reveal mechanisms of protection in COVID-19,"Characterising the protective host-response in COVID-19 is a critical step towards developing effective treatments and vaccines. Increasing pathogen load stimulates the host response to infection, but identifying the protective components of the response in humans is challenging in cross-sectional studies. Variation occurs between individuals in both the dynamics of pathogen load over time and the relationship between pathogen load and magnitude of the host response, and this variation can be harnessed to identify correlates of protection. A mathematical model of the relationships between pathogen load and host response can be developed using population data and then used to make quantitative estimates of the model parameters determining pathogen load for individual subjects. Importantly, we have shown that parameter estimates in individuals can then be correlated with measured host factors, to identify biological mechanisms controlling pathogen load (Georgiadou et al Nature Microbiology 2019). We propose to develop a within-host model of viral load dynamics in COVID-19 and use it to: i) quantify parameters of viral load control for individuals; ii) predict clinical outcome; iii) identify constitutive host characteristics associated with control of viral load; iv) identify components of the blood and mucosal immune responses which control viral load. We build on extensive clinical and biological data generated by NIHR priority studies ISARIC-4C and DIAMONDS, adding value to these projects and expediting their public health impact. Our approach will deliver a prioritized list of host factors which control viral load dynamics, underpinning development of more effective, and potentially personalised, treatment and vaccine strategies.","1, 4","1d, 1e, 4b"
C09839,Development of colorimetric kits for porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 quantification using gold nanoparticles,"Until the morning of March 31, 2020, 719,700 confirmed cases of SARS-Cov-2 were registered worldwide, causing a collapse in the health system of countries such as Italy, Iran and Spain. Brazil to date has recorded 4,661 confirmed cases, with 165 deaths. The transmission of the virus occurs mainly by contact with secretions and infected people, causing fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia or fatigue, sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. The diagnosis occurs after medical evaluation and laboratory tests such as RT-qPCR. However, these methodologies present as limitations a high cost for analysis of the samples, in addition to requiring specialized professionals and specific equipment. That's why, it is necessary to develop a new reliable and low cost methodology for a quick and simple diagnosis.

C20292,Mindfulness to Combat Health Care Worker Burnout during COVID-19: Evaluating a 4-week tailored program.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are susceptible to virus exposure, increased workload, and moral dilemmas. As such, these essential workers are at risk for burnout. Establishing an effectiveintervention for health care workers to reduce burnout is a critical challenge faced by hospitals, includingWaypoint Centre for Mental Health Care, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Mindfulness programs are known to decrease physician burnout. However, to our knowledge, this proposed research is the first to evaluate the efficacy of online mindfulness interventions for health care workers, as well as long-term maintenance effects. To-date, face-to-face delivery has been the favoured instructional method for mindfulness programs. WithCOVID-19 rendering in-person delivery impossible, Waypoint would deliver this program virtually.Specifically, leveraging its current face-to-face- mindfulness program, Waypoint will implement a 4-weekonline mindfulness training program adapted from the Mindfulness Without Borders (MWB), MindfulnessAmbassador Program, an evidence-based curriculum, rooted in social and emotional development. The online program will be delivered by certified Waypoint facilitators, and open to all health care workers across theNorth Simcoe Muskoka area. Georgian College's Department of Research and Innovation will leverage itsdeveloped network of researchers to lead and support this project. Collaboratively, with Waypoint, researchers will examine the efficacy of the 4-week online program on mitigating burnout in health care workers andenhancing resilience, plus quantify the long-term effects in health care workers. Knowledge gained will beshared with health care leaders tasked with combatting burnout during a pandemic, and guide the delivery of wellbeing programs in the broader community. Findings will help combat COVID-19-related burnout andmental health issues, as well as springboard development of an online curriculum that can be deliveredremotely and safely during a pandemic to health care workers.","10, 11","10a, 11f"

Identifying persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 before theypresent to health care can reduce transmission and flatten the epidemic curve. The San Francisco BayArea was particularly hard hit early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and like many partsof the United States, has substantial racial/ethnic disparities in the distribution of cases of COVID-19 inthe City. The eastern parts of the City have the highest case rates, with most heavily impactedcommunities including the Mission, Bayview and Sunnydale neighborhoods, and the Tenderloin, butrelatively few COVID-19 testing sites exist there. In addition, outbreaks have been occurring incongregate living situations in San Francisco, where testing can be difficult to perform. We plan toincrease SARS-CoV-2 testing through 2 low-barrier testing approaches to identify previouslyundiagnosed persons. First, we will use a mobile testing unit to reach persons in facilities andneighborhoods where COVID-19 rates are high. Second, we will conduct testing through a communitymobilization event in a heavily impacted neighborhood in the southeast San Francisco, testing morethan 3000 persons over a four-day time period. We will integrate HIV testing into SARS-CoV-2 testing, asrates of HIV testing have dramatically declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and thereis substantial overlap in the populations at risk of both types of infection. These activities will have theadditional benefit of increasing capacity at the 2 Clinical Research Sites of the San Francisco Bay ClinicalTrials Unit to conduct COVID-19 research, including trials of vaccines and therapeutic interventions.",3,3a

Here, we will engage in the comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 life-cycle in the human intestinal epithelium. (1) we will evaluate if there are infectious virus particles in stool. (2) we will develop standardized protocols to establish a robust measure for enteric virus shedding. (3) in organoids models, we will characterize how SARS-CoV-2 infects, replicates and is released from intestinal epithelial cells. This will provide the molecular basis of the enteric lifecycle and will enable us to determine the origin of the enteric phase (fecal/oral transmission vs. spreading from lung to gut). To these goals, we will exploit a pipeline combining single cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics which we developed to study host-virus interaction. Combined with in-situ measurement of immune response in biopsies, we will define whether exacerbated gut inflammation contributes to the lung pathology observed in patients through cytokine storm-induced cytopathic effects.  We anticipate that understanding the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 will provide us with critical pieces of evidence to outline novel perspectives to treat the disease and eradicate the virus. Most importantly, quantifying the relevance of fecal transmission and its link to SARS-CoV-2 etiology is urgently needed to implement epidemiological and societal measures aiming at monitoring and controlling the virus.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

C04709,Functional screenings for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-induced cellular syncytia identifies approved drugs for COVID-19 therapy,"Post-mortem analysis of lungs from COVID-19 patients revealed the presence of numerous pneumocyte syncytia (cells that have fused with each other to form large multi-nuclear structures). Since the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in heterologous cells results in the formation of syncytia, this system was used to screen for FDA/EMA-approved drugs that inhibit Spike-mediated heterologous cell-cell fusion. Of the successful drugs isolated in the screen, three of them were studied further. All three, in addition to inhibiting syncytia formation, also inhibited viral replication. The top candidate was found to also be an inhibitor of a calcium-activated chloride channel that is involved in cell-cell fusion. In our lab at the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, KCL, we used electrophysiology to show that cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein have an increased channel activity in line with the idea that the virus stimulates syncytia formation via its activation. Our data may also help explain some of the side-effects of COVID-19, which include alveolar oedema and diarrhoea, both of which could be potentially linked to the activity of this channel.",1,1b
P25357,"Characterisation, determinants, mechanisms and consequences of the long-term effects of COVID-19: providing the evidence base for health care services","We will address the following patient defined questions:  What is long-COVID and how is it diagnosed?  Why have I got long-COVID?  What effects will long-COVID have on my health, ability to work and family? What are my chances of recovery?  How will this research ensure I am getting the right treatment and support for long-COVID?   Physical and mental health consequences of C-19 infection, termed long-COVID, occur frequently.  Our understanding of long-COVID, including how best to diagnose, risk factors, health and economic consequences, is poor, limiting efforts to help people.   We will use a combination of national anonymised linked primary care electronic health records, and longitudinal studies of people of all ages across the country.  We have asked participants about C-19 infections, long-COVID symptoms, and have collected health and socioeconomic information for many years before the pandemic.  From these studies, we will ask people reporting long-COVID, and comparator groups, to wear a wrist band measuring exercise ability, breathing, and heart rate, and complete online questionnaires on mental health and cognitive function.  They will also be invited to clinic for non-invasive imaging to look at potential damage to vital organs, such as the brain, lungs and heart.  Patients, members of the public overseeing electronic health record research, and study members have been involved in shaping the research questions, and will be consulted for the duration of the project.

C00998,Rational design and evaluation of novel mRNA vaccines against MERS-CoV,"AbstractTraditional strategies of vaccine development suffer from long-term and costly manufacture, and as a result,often fail to respond rapidly to newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. By contrast, messengerRNA (mRNA) is rising as a new technology platform to develop vaccines ""on demand"" against viral pathogens,offering attractive advantages such as cell-free production, non-viral delivery, as well as simple, fast and cost-effective manufacture. Further improvement upon mRNA's stability and translation efficiency, understanding oftheir immune mechanisms, and evaluation of their protective efficacy will facilitate the development of next-generation mRNA vaccine technologies against diverse viral pathogens. Middle-East respiratory syndrome(MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic, emerging infectious virus posing a continuous threatto public health worldwide. There are currently no MERS vaccines approved for use in humans. MERS-CoVspike (S) protein, particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), is an important vaccine target. We havepreviously shown that MERS-CoV RBD contains a critical neutralizing domain capable of inducing strongcross-neutralizing antibodies and protecting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice againstMERS-CoV infection with outstanding efficacy. However, production of subunit vaccines and other traditionalvaccines has limitations, such as low expression and complex purification. To address these unmetchallenges, we propose to rationally design and evaluate novel mRNA vaccines, using MERS-CoV as a modelpathogen and MERS-CoV S protein as a target antigen. We hypothesize that with appropriate modificationand optimization, MERS-CoV S protein RBD-based mRNA vaccines will demonstrate improved stability,increased translation efficiency, and enhanced immunogenicity in both mouse and non-human primates (NHP)models, with protective efficacy on par with the RBD-based subunit vaccine. The specific aims are to (1)rationally design MERS-CoV mRNA vaccines with improved stability and translation efficiency, (2) carefullyoptimize mRNA formulations and immunization regimens towards in-vivo evaluation of their immunogenicityand mode of action in wild-type mice, and (3) comprehensively evaluate protective efficacy of MERS-CoVmRNA vaccines and elucidate their protective mechanisms in hDPP4-Tg mice and NHPs. Of note, we will alsoexamine the utility of new technologies such as microfluidics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysisof B-cell response in mRNA vaccine development and evaluation. The long-term goal is to develop a safeand effective mRNA vaccine that is able to (1) maintain sufficient quantity and quality suitable for industrial-scale production, and (2) meet the WHO Target Product Profiles for rapid onset of immunity in outbreaksettings and long-term protection of people at high ongoing risk of MERS-CoV. Together, the proposed projectwill shed light on protective mechanisms of mRNA vaccines, and provide much-needed information andguidelines for developing mRNA vaccines against diverse viral pathogens with pandemic potential.",7,7a
C20449,"The association between COVID-19-related attitudes, concerns and behaviours in relation to Government policies (the iCARE Study): Optimising policy and communication strategies to improve health, economic and quality of life outcomes throughout the pandemic.","COVID-19 has caused a global public health emergency. While waiting for a vaccine, governments are using a number of policies that focus on changing people behaviour to stop the spread of the virus. However, for these policies to work and stop the spread of COVID-19 and improve the economy, people need to actually do (adhere to) the recommendations. For people to adhere to these policies they need: 1) to be aware of the policies; 2) see the policies as important; and 3) feel able to actually do the things they are being asked to do. All of these 3 things are influenced by where people are from, who they are, their current health, and the environment around them. Unfortunately, policies have changed over time and the exact polices and how people are told about the policies (messaging) varies greatly between and within countries. This has led to uncertainty among people about what is behind the government decisions and confusion about which policies to follow. The iCARE Study is a global survey that captures data on peoples' awareness, attitudes, and behaviours in relation to COVID-19 policies. We also ask how the pandemic is impacting peoples' physical and mental health, economic situation, and quality of life. In addition to over 70,000 survey responses, we collect data on number of cases and deaths, information about policies across different countries, and how people are moving about in their countries.

P22378,"Characterization of socioeconomic and land use factors related to Aedes aegypti distribution in Maricopa County, Arizona","Project Summary  Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are primary vectors of dengue, yellow fever, and the newly emerged threats of Zika  and chikungunya viruses. In recent years, mosquito-borne diseases have reemerged as a pressing public health  issue around the world, as the geographic range of mosquitoes has increased rapidly due to expanded global  trade and travel and potentially due to increased temperatures caused by climate change. Maricopa County,  Arizona is potentially at risk for developing Ae. aegypti transmitted diseases due to the established presence of  the mosquito vector and the high volume of travelers coming to Arizona from areas with endemic Ae. aegypti-  borne disease. In fact, on average, over 25 million travelers cross the border from Mexico (an area with diseases  transmitted by the vector) into Arizona each year. Although much research exists on the wide-scale distribution  of mosquito vectors, there is less understanding of the local factors that promote mosquito populations or the  geographic range of the mosquitoes, especially in a desert climate. It is not known whether there are local  socioeconomic or environmental characteristics that support larger Ae. aegypti populations or how mosquitoes  move between local populations. We will use a combination of statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and  phylogenomic analysis to develop a better understanding of the local factors that support mosquito populations  and how mosquito populations are moving over time and space. The long-term goal of this project is to identify  small-scale socioeconomic or landscape characteristics that consistently support Ae. aegypti populations and  implement interventions with the Vector Control Division in Maricopa County, AZ to reduce mosquito  populations, thereby reducing disease transmission risk. The rationale for this application is that the  understanding of the distribution, range, and movement of the mosquito populations is a critical component of  implementing effective public health efforts that can reduce disease burden and cost by aiming to prevent  potential outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease.  Hypothesis: Ae. aegypti will not be uniformly distributed throughout Maricopa County, with some areas  having larger populations due to differences in infrastructure or landscape characteristics (which are related to  neighborhood socioeconomic status) and therefore potential mosquito habitat. Furthermore, we hypothesize  that genetically distinct populations will be separated by short distances and will be unique to specific  neighborhoods.  Aim 1: Characterize the neighborhood socioeconomic factors associated with Ae. aegypti abundance.  Aim 2: Characterize landscape traits, such as greenness, that are associated with Ae. aegypti populations.  Aim 3: Characterize the origin of and migration between local Ae. aegypti mosquito populations within  Maricopa County, Arizona.",2,"2b, 2c"
P21828,"RFA-GH-21-006, SICA Study: Seroepidemiological Insight into COVID-19 transmission in Africa","PROJECT SUMMARY  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in vastly different health outcomes for populations in Sub-Saharan Africa  as compared to other countries with comparatively higher case numbers and deaths. The comparatively low  numbers of cases and deaths reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria, as well as  throughout sub-Saharan Africa, are likely reflective of poor healthcare infrastructure and limited testing capacity.  It is also unclear how the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in urban vs. rural settings may influence COVID-  19 severity and the subsequent identification of cases by testing sites in both countries. Our overarching  hypothesis is that prior exposure to related coronaviruses and other pathogens, which partition differentially in  urban vs. rural communities, have resulted in significant cross-protective immunity or innate immune priming in  the population, which leads to a reduced COVID-19 burden in these countries. We will leverage ongoing  longitudinal cohort studies in urban and rural sites in the DRC and Nigeria, to support the characterization of: (i)  the incidence of and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, (ii) the current distribution  and severity of respiratory/non-respiratory viral and non-viral pathogens as a cause of non-COVID-19 acute  febrile illness, and (iii) role that exposure to syndemic pathogens have on COVID-19 severity. To this end, we  propose to describe the incidence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 using seroepidemiology and describe factors  associated with incidence and recovery (AIM1) and the epidemiology of respiratory and non-respiratory viral or  parasitic pathogens viz. acute febrile illness (AFI) during the COVID-19 pandemic (AIM2). Our long-standing  relationships through community engagement activities, and direct ties to the Public Health ministries as well as  the Africa Centres for Disease Control allow us to obtain and convey accurate data at local resolution. We  envision that this multinational surveillance project will provide much needed insight into the epidemiology of  SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in the DRC and Nigeria, elucidating differences in the incidence  and disease outcomes across a range of urban vs. rural settings, which in turn can inform public health policy  and control measures at country and regional levels.",3,"3a, 3b,3d"
P22365,Auditory physiology in children exposed to the Zika virus,"Abstract:  Prenatal exposure to the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause a wide range of neurologic abnormalities  and developmental disabilities. Studies in children with microcephaly due to ZIKV have identified language  delays, but there is a gap in knowledge regarding the state of the auditory system because most evaluations of  auditory function in these populations have been limited to newborn hearing screening and assessment of  peripheral hearing sensitivity. Additionally, a large group of children with prenatal exposure to ZIKV but without  microcephaly has been largely understudied despite the emerging evidence of residual ZIKV effects on  speech/language development in those otherwise asymptomatic cases. Identifying auditory problems that  could impact listening and communication is critical for preparing adequate care plans as the children enter  school. The proposed international research collaboration will focus on filling in these knowledge gaps by  systematically and comprehensively characterizing auditory function and its relationship to communicative  developmental outcomes in children 4-8 years of age with history of prenatal exposure to ZIKV. The following  groups will be studied: (1) children with ZIKV-related microcephaly; (2) children prenatally exposed to ZIKV  without microcephaly; and (3) control subjects matched on age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). The  proposed longitudinal study will address three specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will characterize auditory function  in children with microcephaly due to the ZIKV. We hypothesize that, despite normal peripheral hearing test  results, cortical responses will differ from those of age-, sex-, and SES-matched controls. Specific Aim 2 will  characterize auditory function in children exposed to the ZIKV but without microcephaly. We hypothesize that  this group will have altered auditory function, indexed by atypical cortical responses. Specific Aim 3 will  evaluate concurrent and predictive relationships between auditory neural responses and language outcomes in  children with prenatal exposure to ZIKV with and without microcephaly. For all participants, we will acquire  auditory physiologic responses from the middle ear through cortex and measures of speech/language ability at  three time points over 30 months to identify potential indicators related to risk for delays in development of  speech, language, and listening problems. We will also examine how additional risk factors, medical history,  and general neurodevelopment relate to auditory response findings. The proposed work will be accomplished  through a collaboration between scientists at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and researchers in two  states in Brazil who follow some of the largest cohorts of ZIKV-exposed infants in the world. Colleagues in the  US and Brazil will have complementary roles in providing expertise in characterizing physiologic function and  developing clinical applications in this unique and important population. The results of this work will clarify the  impact of ZIKV on auditory function and identify clinically useful measures for detection and management of  risk for communication delays that are needed to facilitate adaptive functioning and academic success.",4,"4b, 4d"
P22938,Genetic Contributors to the Impact of Sex on Heterogeneity in Flu Infection,"Project Summary/Abstract   The 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have killed 1 in 20 people worldwide. Influenza A virus (IAV)  infections usually do not cause such severe disease for the ~30 million infected every year in the United States  alone (2014-2015). However, there are broad differences in IAV susceptibility and severity, with outcomes from  asymptomatic infections (~16%) to death (0.2% in 2014-2015). These differences arise from the complex  interplay of exposure, environment, IAV genetics, and host factors.   A crucial host factor that contributes to heterogeneity of IAV infection is sex. For children and older  individuals, males are more likely to experience severe disease, while females of child-bearing age have greater  severity. As there is strong evidence for 1) the importance of sex in IAV infection, 2) gene expression differences  between males and females, and 3) human genetic variation impacting infectious disease in general and  specifically IAV infection, synthesis of these three areas may provide crucial mechanistic insight. We hypothesize  that sex differences in gene expression are a major driver of heterogeneity in IAV infection. To elucidate these  differences, this project will integrate cutting-edge approaches to identify sex-specific differences in transcript  abundance and splicing that regulate IAV burden and host response in human cells, IAV challenge volunteers,  and natural populations. Further, we will define the genotype x sex interactions that form the mechanistic basis  for how genetic diversity contributes to sex differences in IAV infection.   To achieve these goals, we have unique datasets of IAV infection heterogeneity in cells from dozens of  male and female donors, in nasal curettage and peripheral blood from human IAV challenge subjects, and  biobanked samples of natural IAV infection with outcomes ranging from mild infection to death. Computational  analyses of these datasets will define 1) sex differences in gene expression that correlate with IAV burden and  symptom severity and 2) human SNPs that regulate sex-biased gene expression and flu severity. The  transcriptional profiles from these datasets will be used to generate sex-specific biomarkers of IAV infection  severity using machine learning approaches. Finally, we will experimentally determine whether the identified  sex-biased genes and SNPs regulate IAV burden and host response in cellular models of infection. All results  will be available through an easy-to-use web database for exploring this rich dataset as a launchpad for further  mechanistic and clinical studies.

Peptides have been used to treat diabetes, neuropathic pain, cancer, and HIV. As chemists we have very recently invented news ways to make peptides both more potent as well as fluorescent in order to see where they go and how they act. We are poised to interface our technology with molecular modelling to synthesize peptides that will intercept the virus before it can enter a cell. These peptides can be injected or nasally delivered for therapy and can be used prior to vaccine development or in cases where certain patients cannot be vaccinated.",6,6a
C06208,Household transmission and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 among paediatric clients of a primary care centre in a low-resource community in Rio de Janeiro,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 in children is important for their health, as well as for their families and communities, particularly in crowded living conditions such as slums, where households are very small and it is almost impossible to keep children within their homes.The aim of this project is to study the household transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The researchers will examine and test for COVID-19 in a sample of children and their families from one of the poorest neighborhoods of the city, with regular follow-up visits over two years. The study expects to bring more evidence to the role of children in disease transmission, answering questions such as whether adults catch the virus at work, then transmit it to their children or do children catch the virus from neighbours, then bring it back to their families.     ""The risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 comes down to a variety of factors, from genetics, to behaviour, to the environment in the home. We're hoping to tease variables apart with statistical models and figure out which ones are the most important."" Leonard Bastos, Associate Researcher, FIOCRUZ, Brazil",3,"3a, 3b"
P24916,SE0572: Developing capability for detection of Monkeypox exposure in animals - SE0572,"Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic viral disease clinically similar to smallpox, although less severe. The disease is caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV) which is predominantly found in west and central Africa. Monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family, that is occasionally transmitted to humans from animal host (reservoir) species, including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates and other species.There are two distinct genetic clades of the MPXV: the central African (Congo Basin) clade and the west African clade. The current MPX outbreak is caused by the west African clade, which historically causes a less severe form of disease than the Congo Basin clade with disease symptoms/clinical signs usually lasting between 2 to 4 weeks with case fatality ratio around 1'Äì3%. Monkeypox is a disease of global public health importance as it not only affects countries in west and central Africa, but the rest of the world. In 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was in the United States of America and was linked to contact with infected pet prairie dogs. These pets had been housed with Gambian pouched rats and dormice that had been imported into the country from Ghana. This outbreak led to over 70 cases of monkeypox in the U.S.A. Monkeypox has also been reported in travelers from Nigeria to Israel in September 2018, to the United Kingdom in September 2018, December 2019 and May 2021. In 2022, MPX has been reported in 13 non-endemic countries, including Australia, North America, Europe and United Kingdom (over 100 cases) to date. The spread of MPXV between different semi-wild animal species and subsequent transmission to humans was documented in North America in 2003, where imported animals infected with MPX were housed with semi-wild animals which later developed signs of MPXV infection after being sold. Consequently, 47 confirmed and probable animal to human cases (no human to human transmission cases) were reported (HAIRS 14). Human to human transmission may occur through contact with clothing or linens (such as bedding or towels) used by an infected person, direct contact with MPX skin lesions or scabs, or through respiratory droplets when an infected person with a MPX rash coughs or sneezes (HAIRS 13). Although animal to human and human to human transmission of MPXV is known and has been documented a number of times, human to animal transmission is poorly understood. During MPX outbreaks there is a low but potential risk of transmission to companion/pet animals from MPXV infected humans when housed together in close proximity. Infected pets pose a threat to the continual spread of virus and disease especially when the animals are subclinical and/or are not diagnosed. If companion animals were to be infected there is a possibility that virus may be transmitted to susceptible wildlife species, with rodents being the most likely scenario. This project will be used to develop APHA's and the UK's preparedness to test suspect animals, including companion/pet animals, to confirm the presence of virus in cases of known or probable exposure and/or absence of infection post isolation/quarantine restriction periods. The project will also be used to develop tools to study MPXV pathogenicity in companion and wild animals, building validated capability and capacity.","1, 2","1a, 2a"

C00140,"Assessing and addressing the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 among pregnant women and health care providers in Anhui, China","On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. In addition to focusing on immediate clinical/biomedical needs relat-ed to the outbreak, it is also important to consider potential mental health impacts. Pregnancy can be a time of heightened vulnerability, especially during public health emergencies. Women may have several concerns related to: their health and fetus; the health of family, friends, and their infants; access to ser-vices; potential exposure during hospital deliveries; and social isolation, among others. Health care pro-viders (HCPs) also face mental, physical, and social challenges that can affect their wellbeing and ability to care for patients. Building on our team's existing research work and infrastructure, we will first assess the potential impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on pregnant women's mental health (depression) and the implementation of a perinatal depression and screening and management program in Ma'anshan, Chi-na. Secondly, we will then evaluate the effect of a cognitive behavioral therapy intervention aimed at re-ducing depression in pregnant women and investigate changes in the acceptability of and adherence to the intervention. Thirdly, we will investigate potential impacts in terms of adverse birth outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and explore women's experiences during the outbreak. Fourthly, we also plan to assess anxiety among HCPs and investigate the provision of perinatal health care during and after the emergency. This study aims to contribute to the global COVID-19 response, foster our understanding of the potential mental health impacts of the emergency, reduce public health risk and burden, and help inform clinical and public health responses to the outbreak.",10,10a
C10680,Presence of Family,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted long term care (LTC) facilities across Canada. While restrictive visitation measures were important to limit the spread of the virus, the resulting prolonged separation from family members, had a tremendous impact on the well-being and quality of life of residents. This proposal is to support the implementation and sustainability of public health directives to increase the presence of family (including friends) in LTC facilities through 'support visitations' during COVID-19. This work aligns with CFHI's attention to practices that enhance the presence of family in LTC and the growing body of research that confirms family play a critical role in LTC. Family often assist with feeding, grooming and mobility and the absence of this partner in care during the pandemic resulted in hardship for residents, families and staff. As public health restrictions fluctuate in response to the second wave of the pandemic, it is therefore important to understand the implementation process for support visitations, what factors will support sustainability as the pandemic unfolds, and what the outcomes are of support visitations on residents, family and staff.   Our aims are:  1.To explore and identify the contextual attributes of settings where support visitations have been adopted to articulate successful implementation processes.   2.To understand facilitators that support the implementation of support visitations as COVID-19 remains present in LTC and broader community settings.   3.To understand how family has been engaged/represented in the implementation process.  4.To assess the outcomes and impacts of support visitations on residents, family and staff.   5.To obtain insights into implementation and sustainability factors from other jurisdictions adopting similar support visitations practice.",10,10d
P21788,Uncovering and harnessing connected metabolic pathways essential to virus infection.,"Project Summary / Abstract  Polyamines are small molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that function in transcription and translation.  While these molecules are important for cellular function, emerging evidence suggests that polyamine  metabolism is intricately linked to diverse metabolic pathways within the cell. The interconnectedness of  metabolic pathways has significant consequences for cells, as well as pathogens. We previously demonstrated  that polyamines support replication of diverse RNA viruses and that upon detection of infection, cells induce  polyamine depletion. Polyamine depletion limits infection by bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus [RVFV] and  La Crosse virus [LACV]), flaviviruses (Zika virus [ZIKV] and dengue viruses), and enteroviruses  (Coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3], rhinovirus), among several others. We hypothesize that these distinct virus  families subvert cellular metabolism, specifically through polyamines, to support virus replication.  Here, we will investigate (1) how viruses utilize polyamines at distinct stages of replication, (2) how viruses  confront polyamine depletion, and (3) how polyamine biosynthesis connects to other metabolic pathways to  support virus replication.  We use the RVFV, ZIKV, and CVB3 model systems in our work because these viruses represent three  evolutionarily distant viruses with different replicative and structural differences. While each of these viruses  relies on polyamines for replication, we find that how they use polyamines is different. Now, we will expand on  this work to understand the roles of distinct polyamines during virus infection, including roles in virion structure,  cellular attachment, and genome replication. We will also use these model systems to understand how these  viruses manipulate polyamine metabolism. Finally, we will investigate how the differences in polyamine  utilization may reflect how polyamines affect other cellular metabolic pathways, including lipid and cholesterol  synthesis. This work will illuminate the connectedness of polyamine biosynthesis to other metabolic pathways  and how viruses rely on these interconnected pathways for successful replication. This work will highlight  fundamental roles for polyamines in virus replication and in cellular metabolism.",1,1b

P22605,Characterizing variation and adaptation in the immune response to plague (Y. pestis) through single-cell sequencing and ancient genomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Pathogens have been one of the strongest selective pressures in human evolution. Migrating out of Africa,  modern humans encountered novel pathogens along with new environments. These populations likely adapted  to these pathogens, leading to population-specific adaptations. Consistent with this hypothesis, some of the most  compelling signatures of local adaptation in the human genome overlap genes involved in immunity and host  defense. Importantly, these regions also overlap genetic loci which are associated with infectious, autoimmune,  and inflammatory disease risk in modern humans. Thus, understanding adaptation to pathogens throughout  history is important for understanding modern human health.   The Black Plague was likely one of the strongest selective events in recent human history. Exposure to  Yersinia pestis (the causative agent of plague) therefore likely drove adaptations in the human immune system  which continue to shape modern immune variation. Importantly, because the plague ravaged Eurasia while  leaving sub-Saharan Africa relatively untouched, adaptation to plague likely occurred in European but not African  populations. However, it is not known whether human populations differ in their immune response to plague as  a consequence of prior evolutionary history. Addressing this gap is not only important for understanding the  recent evolution of the human immune system, but may also help reveal the molecular basis of ancestry-related  differences in susceptibility to infectious disease, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune disorders.   The basic research questions driving this proposal are: What was the impact of Y. pestis to the functional  differentiation of immune responses between African- and European-ancestry individuals? To which extent  natural selection has favored the increase in frequency of protective alleles in Europeans, a population with  increased exposure to Y. pestis? What cell types and immunological pathways show the most divergence in  response to Y. pestis between populations? To answer this questions, I will experimentally infected peripheral  blood cells in culture to characterize the immune response to plague. Using single-cell RNA sequencing I will be  able to analyze variation in the immune response across cell types, but also characterize differences in the  proportion of cells responding to infection and the strength of that response. Using this data, I will identify genes  and pathways which are regulated differently in individuals of European and African ancestry, and  identify genetic variants which contribute to these differences. I will then use a combination of ancient and  modern genomics to test whether loci underlying variation in the immune response to Y. pestis also experienced  position selection during the Black Plague. Thus, this project is a novel integration of functional and population  genetic approaches to study adaptation to a deadly human pathogen. At its conclusion, this study will reveal how  Europeans adapted to Y. pestis exposure during the plague, and identify highly-promising genetic candidates  which may contribute to disease susceptibility in modern human populations.",1,"1c, 1d"
C10078,"A phase I/II study to determine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in UK healthy adult volunteers","Summary:    Researchers at University of Oxford are developing a coronavirus vaccine called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The vaccine acts by encouraging the immune system to recognise and attack the coronavirus. It is made from a harmless virus called an adenovirus that has been altered to produce the surface spike protein of COVID-19. The study will assess if healthy people can be protected from COVID-19 with this new vaccine. It will give information on the safety of the vaccine and how well it can create a good immune response against the virus. The first trials will be in younger adults, followed by people over 55 and, then larger trials in adults over 18 years, before studies in later school age children. In this trial over 1000 healthy adults, aged 18 - 55 years of age in the UK will be given either the coronavirus vaccine or a control vaccine (that cannot protect against COVID-19) on a random basis. Participants will be asked to complete a diary for 7 days after the vaccination to provide information on how they feel. They will be closely monitored by the study team. They will be asked to return for blood tests between 5 and 9 times over a 12-month period and information will be collected about any symptoms that occur after vaccination If the vaccine is shown to be safe and effective in these earlier trials, vaccine manufacturing will be increased to allow larger studies to take place.    Description:    A new virus causing respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread to many other countries around the world, despite unprecedented containment efforts. The virus is part of the Coronavirus family which may cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. This recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. The WHO declared the COVID-19 epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th January 2020. There are no currently licensed vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19. Vaccines are the most cost effective way of controlling outbreaks and the international community have stepped-up their efforts towards developing one against COVID-19. This study will enable us to assess if healthy people can be protected from COVID-19 with this new vaccine called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. It will also give us valuable information on safety aspects of the vaccine and its ability to generate good immune responses against the virus. We will do this by randomly allocating participants to receive the vaccine or a placebo injection in addition to doing blood tests and collecting information about any symptoms that occur after vaccination. The study would enrol up to 510 healthy adults, aged 18 - 55 years of age living near to a study site in the UK. Dependent on the group, there will be between five and nine study visits over a 12 month period. Participants will be asked to complete a diary for 7 days after the vaccination and will be closely monitored by the study team.",7,"7c, 7d"

C07409,COPE-Birmingham: The contribution of occupational exposures to risk of COVID-19 and approaches to control among healthcare workers,"Healthcare workers have higher risk of getting coronavirus (COVID-19 disease). Contact with infected patients, the type of work and measures such as use of masks affect their risk. However, factors outside the workplace are also important. For example, being older, from minority ethnic groups, some health conditions and home circumstances increase risk. We don't know how these aspects compare with workplace risks, or which work exposures are most risky.  We will invite about 5000 staff with different job-roles and departments from three large West Midlands NHS Trusts (University Hospitals Birmingham, Birmingham Women's and Children's and The West Midlands Ambulance Trust) to join our study. These will include workers who had a COVID-19 test because of symptoms. We will also invite some workers with no symptoms.

C07320,Investigating the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on stranger sex offender behaviour and victim vulnerability,"In times of crisis, we know that offenders continue to commit crimes, and do so in a manner afforded by the new context (Thornton & Voigt, 2012). Sex offenders are versatile (Lovell et al., 2019), and change their offending behaviour in accordance with the opportunity to offend (Woodhams & Komarzynska, 2014). The Covid-19 outbreak is a crisis that will alter offender behaviour, as well as who is vulnerable to sexual violence and in what circumstances. Our research is highly urgent because, in the UK and internationally, the police and other stakeholders need to know now how to protect people from new vulnerabilities to sexual violence created by Covid-19, and support those victimised. Sexual violence is a shadow pandemic that should be a key priority in planning a Covid-19 response (UN Women, 2020). We are in a unique position to fill this research gap, documenting the 'who, what, when, where and how' of stranger sexual offending (Leclerc et al. 2016), pre-, peri-(and potentially, post-) Covid-19, and across shorter time-periods defined by differing local/national restrictions. Our project partner, the Serious Crime Analysis Section (SCAS) of the National Crime Agency, has a unique, large dataset of serious stranger sex offences that will be subject to repeated, multi-level analyses using our complementary expertise in analytical techniques from the social and engineering sciences. As well as being of urgent relevance to stakeholders, our research will bring new insights to the sparse literature on situational crime prevention and sexual offending (Chiu et al., 2020).",10,"10b, 10d"
C09567,Minimal False-alarm Touch-based Detection of SARS-Cov-2 Virus Particles using Poly-aptamers,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTAvailable tools for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus require extensive sample preparation and/or expensive lab-based equipment to obtain accurate results. The objective in this proposal is to build a touch-screen sensor arrayto directly capture, detect, and identify model SARS-CoV-2 virus particles with minimal false alarms. This ambi-tious goal will be achieved by the interdisciplinary team of GE Research scientists and engineers and will be asynergistic combination of the proposed innovations and the prior scientific and engineering accomplishmentsof the team. Our proposed solution is based on several innovations driven by eliminating a need for a dedicated sam-pling step and solving the problems of detection and reliable selective recognition of virus particles, performingdetection/recognition operation in a two-dimensional (2D) format of biosensors, e.g., as a touch-screen surface,and having this technical solution as a low-profile, low power, unobtrusive device that can be adapted to diverseapplication scenarios. Innovations of the proposed proof-of-principle touch-screen detector are in three main areas. For virusrecognition, we will create new multifunctional bioreceptors. Our transduction principle will be based on ourearlier reported transduction with the significantly enhanced performance. Our touch surface design will have a2D array of biosensors. The proposed proof-of-principle sensor will be developed in five aims. Aim 1 will focus on demonstration of new multifunctional bioreceptors. Aim 2 will focus on validation of the functionality of these multifunctionalbioreceptors upon their immobilization on sensor surface. Aim 3 will focus on demonstration of sensing of mod-el virus particles in a layout of 2D array of biosensors. Aim 4 will focus on demonstration of virus recognitionwith immobilized multifunctional bioreceptors in variable ambient conditions. Aim 5 will focus on demonstra-tion of enhanced detection and recognition of model virus particles in the same layout of 2D array of biosensorsas in Aim 3, but under variable ambient conditions. The findings in this proposed work will change the state-of-the-art biosensing paradigm and will improve the scientific knowledge, technologies, and workflow practice forvirus detection.",1,"1a, 1b"

C00825,Targeting invasion strategy of SARS-CoV-2 in bronchial epithelial cells,"Abstract: ""COVID19 is caused by the infection of airway epithelial cells and causes severe respiratory collapse that escalates in an overactivation of the immune system. Objectives: To identify the cellular mechanisms in primary epithelial cells in response to SARS-Cov2, the regulation of ACE2, pattern recognition receptors and host defense mechanisms. Further, to investigate the effect of IFN-g and IL-4 on epithelial infection and understand, which epithelial differentiation stages are susceptible to SARS-Cov2. Furthermore, we will investigate the role of potential therapeutic options to inhibit IFN-?-induced ACE2 expression using specific inhibitors for bradykinin-b2 receptor (Icatibant;HOE140), JAK/STAT-pathway (Tofacitinib), FoxO1 (AS1842856), as the ACE2 promoter contains IRF2 and FOXO1 binding sites.Preliminary Results: Primary human epithelial cells can differentiate into type-1 and type-2 epithelial cells affecting large proportions of the functional portfolio. We propose to identify the Sars-Cov2 secretion profile triggered in E1-differentiated cells, which could be used for home-care diagnostic kits, even if the viral origin is unknown. We discovered that ACE2, the SARS-Cov2 entry receptor is strongly up-regulated in the E1 cells. Furthermore, ACE2 protein was found to be higher in E1 cells, while Icatibant, a licensed drug, inhibits ACE2 up-regulation in E1 cells.Outlook: The proposed project sheds light epithelial immune response triggered by SARS-Cov2 in context of the E1 differentiation pathway and offers novel solutions for diagnosis and therapy.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable",6,6a
C15087,Cross-Protective Humoral Immunity to Coronavirus,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY  Global establishment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2 is a continued  human threat. While successful vaccine programs are well underway, genetic drift and immune escape have  already begun to subvert immunity. In addition, related zoonotic coronaviruses threaten transition into the  human population. CoVs can be highly transmissible and highly lethal, posing a grave threat to human lives  and world economies. In this light, developing pan-CoV vaccine options in preparation for the expected broad  range of SARS-CoV-2 variants and future emergent coronaviruses could save millions of lives and prevent  future global catastrophes. While current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines targeting the virus spike (S) protein hold great  promise in providing protection against current circulating strains, research is urgently needed to understand  breadth and durability of immunity across the CoV family and to translate this information into next generation  vaccines with increased breadth to cover SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants as well as to address emergent CoVs.  The overall goal of this program is to produce critical information necessary for the design and testing of next  generation CoV vaccine strategies with the greatest possible breadth across the CoV family. The Program  team will identify humoral, cellular, and structural immunologic features influencing clinical outcomes and  immune recognition breadth in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and human vaccination cohorts to fuel design  and pre-clinical testing of protective coronavirus vaccine strategies to identify those with the greatest possible  breadth. Project 1's goal in this process is to define B cell/serologic properties of broad CoV immunity and  identify vaccine delivery conditions that can best support them. Preliminary discoveries from Project 1 together  with recent literature support the working hypothesis that aspects of vaccine strategy such as antigen choice,  delivery timing, dose, and valency will influence CoV recognition breadth and effectiveness. Knowledge gained  from strategic analysis of the heterogeneity of active human SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccine cohorts  will generate new hypotheses to integrate into pre-clinical vaccine testing approach. In particular, recent work  from Project 1 investigators has identified the conserved S2 domain as promising target for broad CoV  immunity in humans. Program 1's roles in evaluating these hypotheses are to: 1) identify immune correlates of  convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinees that exhibit superior durability and cross-reactivity; 2) define  the mechanisms of cross-reactive monoclonal mediated protection against CoVs in vivo; and 3) evaluate the  efficacy of novel vaccine immunogens to induce protective B cell/functional serological responses in animals.  Supported by Core B, results from Project 1 will provide strategic antibody, serological and memory B cell  analysis in the context of an integrative programmatic approach in synergy with Projects 2 and 3 approach to  generate vaccine strategies with maximal breadth and effectiveness.","1, 7","1d, 7i, 7l"
C19391,Investigating Human Host Factors Involved in Coronavirus Infection in the Search for Antivirals,"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans and has resulted in a global pandemic since March 2020. Viruses are small pathogens that need to find, bind and enter host cells to replicate and assemble new virus particles that are then released to infect neighbouring cells or other hosts. This project aims to find parts of the human cell (known as host factors) that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. I will continue research from a large experiment which will identify host factors that either help or hinder the virus. We can then use drugs to either inhibit that which helps the virus (pro-viral factors), or promote that which fights the virus (anti-viral factors) to develop antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. Drugs with potential antiviral activity in cell models may then be moved to preclinical mouse models to test if they work against SARS-CoV-2 infection and are safe. I will also assess if any drug targets are translatable to other coronavirus infections. Finding drugs that act against a broad range of coronaviruses may be important in the event of a new, infectious coronavirus outbreak in future.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
C19419,Diversity Amongst Decision Makers?: Black & Minority Ethnic (BME) Representation in Pandemic-Era NHS Management,"Though Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) populations have been significantly overrepresented in COVID-19 mortality statistics, they are vastly underrepresented in NHS management. It is critical to address this lack of diversity amongst decision makers to ensure equitable representation, as current NHS leadership is not adequately representative of the workforce or communities for whom it cares. Principally this project asks: what is the scope and capacity within non-clinical NHS management and NHS decision-making to understand and address BME healthcare worker experience in the face of emerging and changing health care structures, and how can it be improved for the future of equitable health service delivery and diversity in the workforce?    Working with the Nuffield Trust, key project goals are:          Investigate the current understandings and approaches to race and ethnicity within non-clinical London NHS Management teams. This will be achieved through embedded ethnography within 1-3 London NHS Trusts; chosen for diversity of workforce.

Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgentneed. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novelapproach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models toefficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data setsof antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in theoriginal library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identifyneutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.",1,1d

P23159,Towards molecular mechanisms of invertebrate Gustatory Receptors,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Invertebrate Gustatory Receptors (GRs) are a large and evolutionarily diverse family of sensory receptors  known to play important roles in invertebrate taste, smell and thermotransduction. Given the importance of  these sensory modalities in host-seeking behavior in important humand disease vectors like mosquitoes, GR  family members serve as potentially powerful targets for vector control agents. However, little is known about  GR structure and function. We propose a physiological and biochemical analysis of members of two GR  subfamilies: Gr43a and Gr28bD. These initial studies will serve as a precursor for a subsequent R01 to carry  out structural and functional analyses of these GRs.  We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:  Aim #1: Identify and physiologically characterize multiple orthologs of Gr43a and Gr28bD.  Unlike most GRs, Gr43a and Gr28bD orthologs can be functionally characterized in heterologous cells. In aim  1.a., we will express orthologs of these GRs from additional insect species, including disease vectors and  extremophiles, in heterologous cells and characterize their physiological properties. This will enable a  comparative analysis of sequence and function among each receptor class.  Aim #2: Biochemically characterize multiple Gr43a and Gr28bD orthologs. We find Gr43a and  Gr28bD orthologs can be partially purified from heterologous cells. In aim 2, we will expand this approach to  incorporate additional orthologs characterized in aim 1 and optimize our purification protocol and explore key  properties including oligomeric state and thermal stability in various membrane mimics. This will provide  important biochemical information about GR complexes and identify orthologs best suited for subsequent  structural analysis.  The physiological characterization of multiple Gr43a and Gr28bD orthologs will enable direct examination of  evolutionary variation and conservation in GR family function. The expression and purification of multiple  family members will provide multiple candidates for biochemistry and structural determination, maximizing  the likelihood of success of subsequent GR structural determinations.",2,2b

We expect our vaccine  platform to be applicable and effective across a wide range of existing and emerging coronaviruses. As our  system is based on expression in E. coli is it expected to be cost-effective, and our stalk-based approach is  specifically designed to cover a range of distinct coronaviruses.

C07191,Leveraging Bio-Cultural Mechanisms to Maximize the Impact of Multi-Level Preventable Disease Interventions with Southwest Populations,"Title: Eliminating COVID-19 disparities in Arizona in partnership with underserved/vulnerablecommunitiesAbstract Arizona has one of the highest COVID-19 positivity test rates (approximately 19%) in the U.S. Positivityrates are disproportionally higher among Arizona's Latinx, American Indian and African American communities.The proposed community driven and culturally congruent intervention aims to increase access to testing byidentifying and decreasing barriers to testing in vulnerable and underserved communities across Arizona. Theintervention aims at reducing disparities in COVID-19 diagnostics, education, wraparound services andreferrals to a primary care provider, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of underserved communities.The proposed approach empowers local communities, meets community members where they are, is datadriven, and creates the infrastructure for continued community-driven delivery of care. Following a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) orientation, the project will: (a) identifyand prioritize testing deserts, (b) coordinate testing at different levels of the social ecosystem, (c) engage andtrain local Community Health Workers (CHWs) deliver saliva-based COVID-19 testing to vulnerable andunderserved community members, (d) deliver test results within 72 hours, (e) provide wrap-around servicesand provider referrals for those testing positive, and (f) sustain the intervention during a follow-up period. Equality Health Foundation serves as the lead community partner and convener of a growing COVID-19 Coalition of Communities of Color Partners (CCCCP) from across Arizona. The ASU Biodesign ClinicalTesting Laboratory (ABCTL) will provide the saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic. The saliva test'smain benefits are: a) minimal to no PPE requirements compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs; b)convenience and economy of specimen collection; c) ease of repeat sampling; d) administration by minimallytrained CHWs and e) greater sensitivity and consistency of saliva tests than NP swabs. The project aims toadminister 29,000 saliva tests, 10,000-12,000 at identified testing deserts during the launching period, doublingthe numbers during the follow-up period in Year 1, and adding 5,000 tests in Year 2. A longitudinal evaluationwill assess the intervention's impact by comparing randomly selected participants in the R.A.P.I.D. interventionduring the launching period (N=500) with a matched comparison group (N=500) randomly selected fromstandard testing sites.

C04148,COVINFORM  COronavirus Vulnerabilities and INFOrmation dynamics Research and Modelling,"BEHAVIOURAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE OUTBREAK RESPONSES - Policymakers and public health experts unanimously recognise the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable persons: even in countries with well-developed responses, the outbreak and its repercussions imperil the basic well-being of social groups whose livelihoods are already precarious, while the uneven distribution of suffering threatens to aggravate inequality and division. One complicating factor here is the intersectional nature of health and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Another is the complexity of risk in contemporary socioecological systems. The COVINFORM project will draw upon intersectionality theory and complex systems analysis in an interdisciplinary critique of COVID-19 responses on the levels of government, public health, community, and information and communications. The project will conduct research on three levels: 1) on an EU27 MS plus UK level, quantitative secondary data will be analysed and models will be developed; 2) Within 15 target countries, documentary sources on the national level and in at least one local community per country will be analysed; 3) in 10 target communities, primary empirical research will be conducted, utilising both classical and innovative quantitative and qualitative methods (e.g. visual ethnography, participatory ethnography, and automated analysis of short video testimonials). Promising practices will be evaluated in target communities through case studies spanning diverse disciplines (social epidemiology, the economics of unpaid labour, the sociology of migration, etc.) and vulnerable populations (COVID-19 patients, precarious families, migrating health care workers, etc.). The project will culminate in the development of an online portal and visual toolkit for stakeholders in government, public health, and civil society integrating data streams, indices and indicators, maps, models, primary research and case study findings, empirically grounded policy guidance, and creative assessment tools.",9,9e
C09815,Composition of immunoglobulin CDRs: geography and coevolution with fever-inducing pathogens,"Neutralization of a pathogen requires that the link between the specific antibody and the pathogen has optimal affinity. This affinity is determined by the landscape (loads and formats) of the amino acids that make up the regions that will come into contact. The pathogen can escape the host's immune system by changing these amino acids, while the host's immunoglobulin repertoire presents strategies that result in high mutation rates in the contact regions, the CDRs. The high temperatures of the fever produced during a pathology, can alter the conformation of these interface regions, improving or worsening the neutralizing capacity of an antibody. In this project, we will evaluate the amino acid composition of the CDRs regions of neutralizing antibodies against P. falciparum and SARS-CoV-2, in order to determine what is the contribution of the repertoire generated by the germ line in contrast to that obtained by affinity maturation, which occurs under the influence of the pathogen. We will compare the germline repertoires of several modern populations, distributed in different geographic locations, with those obtained from ancestral populations (Neanderthals, Denisovans, etc.). We anticipate that this project will contribute to the understanding of the co-evolution between pathogens and immunoglobulins on two fronts: (i) the influence of geography and local diseases as a selective pressure on the immunoglobulin repertoire, and (ii) the potential contribution to conformational changes in neutralizing immunoglobulins, when under a febrile episode, for the pathogenesis of malaria and COVID-19.

C06669,The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19),"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-coV-2 virus, has now affected at least 1,200,000 people globally, and cases are accumulating in an exponential fashion in many countries, including the United States. Cancer patients have a unique risk profile in this pandemic. Many patients, especially those actively on treatment, have high levels of contact with the health care system. This can include provider visits, phlebotomy, imaging, social work and financial consultations, and infusion room visits for anti-cancer therapy and supportive care such as blood transfusions. Despite heroic efforts to reduce viral transmission in these shared spaces, patients are at an increased risk for COVID-19 exposure. Additionally, most cancer patients are immunocompromised through the marrow toxic effects of anti-cancer drugs, supportive medications such as steroids, and/or the cancer itself; and over 60 years of age, putting them in the highest-risk category for COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Finally, incidences of important comorbidities can be considerably elevated in several cancers, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in lung cancer or inflammatory bowel disease in colorectal cancer, further exacerbating our patients' vulnerability to this novel pathogen. Early reports on prognosis for cancer patients are conflicting and, for the most part, non-peer-reviewed. The largest study published to date includes 18 patients with cancer, who were shown to have increased risk for severe events in multivariate analysis. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy in this cohort, comprising 5 of the 18 cases (28%). Importantly, only five of the 18 patients were known to be on active systemic anti-cancer therapy. Still, these small patient numbers do not reflect the true impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients, particularly patients on active treatment. Given this acute lack of knowledge and concern for extreme vulnerability, the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium was formed to understand how the novel virus affects cancer patients. While this national effort began organically, primarily through social media, membership has quickly grown to over 130 physicians and nurses representing over 60 institutions and organizations in the US. Included in this membership, thus far, are 35 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers, as well as 6 NCI-designated Cancer Centers and large networks of community practices. The driving goal of the consortium is to collect prospective, granular, uniformly organized information to help generate hypotheses for translational science, and to arm treating providers with the most complete data resource as rapidly as possible on cancer patients infected with COVID-19. As the Coordinating Center for the consortium, we will establish and propagate best practices for governance, data collection, and data dissemination. We will host the main data registry and will work with participant institutions setting up mirrored local databases. We will also pilot a prospective biospecimen collection protocol focused on determining whether clonal hematopoiesis in cancer patients with COVID-19 alters their risk profile.",4,4a

C15210,Role of Gut Microbiome- Brain Axis in Modulating CNS Inflammasomes in the Neuropathology Produced by Opioid Exposure and HIV,"Project Summary  Infection with Covid-19 has reached pandemic status with more than 125 million confirmed cases and 2.75  million deaths making it one of the most deadliest pandemics in history. It is associated with severe acute  respiratory syndrome symptoms with high fatality rates. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated when its S-protein  binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through which it gains entry into the host's cells  (Kuba et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2020). ACE2 is highly expressed in the in the lungs and to a lesser degree in  other organs, such as the heart, kidneys, and intestines (Bavishi et al., 2020), which explains the increased  prevalence of lung infection. An analysis of electronic health record data from more than 73 million patients  showed that people with SUDs are at higher risk of contracting and suffering worse consequences from COVID-  19 particularly among African Americans. Those with an opioid use disorder (OUD) were 2.4 times more likely  to have COVID-19 than those with cocaine use disorder (1.6 times), alcohol use disorder (1.4 times), and  tobacco use disorder (smoking or vaping; 1.3 times). Our recent preliminary data show that chronic opioid  treatment in a mouse model of opioid substance abuse resulted in significant increase in the expression ACE2  expression in the lungs and brain of these animals. This data suggests that long term exposure to opioids by  increasing ACE2 expression in the lung will increase the susceptibility to COVID 19 infection and its expression  in the brain suggests high likely hood of neuro-invasiveness. In this supplement we will test the hypothesis that  substance use disorders with opioids will increase the risk for COVID 19 infection in the lung and will be  associated with neuropathological consequence as a consequence of increased ACE2 expression in brain cells.  In Aim 1: We will investigate the expression of ACE2 in small intestine, lung and brain cells in both male and  female mice that are chronically treated with morphine. We will further investigate if substance abuse in context  of HIV further exacerbates infection and disease progression. In Aim 2; we will investigate using a humanized  mouse model where the murine ACE2 receptor is knocked in, the infectivity of the SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein-  Pseudotyped GFP using both in vitro and in vivo target cells. In Aim 3 we will investigate the role of the gut  microbiome in modulating ACE2 expression levels in the small intestine, lung and brain.","1, 4","1b, 4a, 4b"
P22319,The role of TRIM2 and SIRPA in New World Arenavirus entry,"New world hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses (NWAs), such as JunÃƒÂ­n virus, are rodent-transmitted  viruses that cause ~30% mortality when they zoonose into humans. The mechanism by the NWAs  induce disease is still not certain, although it likely includes induction of high levels of cytokines  by infected sentinel cells of the immune system, leading to endothelia and thrombocyte  dysfunction and neurological disease. Survivors of JunÃƒÂ­n infection develop strong humoral  immune responses, suggesting that controlling infection at early times post-infection is critical for  virus clearance. Although an effective JunÃƒÂ­n virus vaccine has decreased disease incidence,  sporadic cases of this as well as the other known and novel NWAs for which there are no vaccines  or effective therapeutics still occur. It is well-established that the clade B pathogenic NWAs bind  to transferrin receptor 1 and other receptors on the cell surface, but the steps leading to their entry  from an acidic cellular compartment are not well-determined. We recently performed a siRNA  screen with pseudotyped viruses bearing a pathogenic JunÃƒÂ­n glycoprotein with the goal of finding  host genes involved in entry that could serve as therapeutic targets. We found that TRIM2, a  member of the tripartite motif family that includes well-known members of the host's intrinsic  defense against viral infections, limits NWA endocytosis into cells. By probing the TRIM2  interactome for other host proteins that block NWA infection, we discovered that SIRPA, a cell  surface protein that inhibits macrophage phagocytosis of tumor and dead cells and erythrocytes,  also decreases infection. Importantly, SIRPA, unlike TRIM2, inhibits infection by various human  pathogenic viruses that require trafficking to an acidic compartment, including VSV, Zika virus,  LCMV and Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 pseudoviruses. Our data suggest that TRIM2 and SIRPA act  at the viral entry/internalization step. These finding suggests that there are common mechanisms  that regulate virus endocytosis and phagocytosis.   We propose here to further investigate the overlap between virus-mediated endocytosis  and phagocytosis in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in three aims that will 1) investigate the overlap in  the NWA entry and phagocytosis pathways; 2) determine where TRIM2/SIRPA inhibition of  infection occurs; and 3) use TRIM2, SIRPA and other relevant knockout mice to probe the roles  of these proteins in cell-type specific and in vivo infection by replication-competent NWAs. In  addition to providing mechanistic insight into the entry of NWAs into cells, these studies have the  potential of increasing our understanding as to how host factors limit infection and could lead to  new approaches to therapeutic intervention.",1,1b

C00121,Targeting programmed ribosomal frameshifting as a therapeutic strategy against 2019-nCoV [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"The new coronavirus 2019-nCoV has spread rapidly in the last 3 months, infecting tens of thousands of people in dozens of countries and killing over 1,000, with no preventive vaccines or medications that can treat it. We propose to search for possible drugs to treat 2019-nCoV by targeting the ability of the virus to hijack the cell's machinery and recode how the genome is read via programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). Coronaviruses use PRF, which is triggered by a specific structure (a 'pseudoknot') in the viral genome, to produce essential enzymes in specific ratios. Suppressing PRF in SARS coronavirus-which is very closely related to 2019-nCoV-disrupts viral propagation and significantly reduces infectivity, suggesting that PRF inhibitors could be used to combat 2019-nCoV. We will search for potential drugs that bind to the 2019-nCoV pseudoknot and disrupt PRF. We will first build a structural model of the pseudoknot by combining computational simulations with measurements revealing the base-pairing patterns and higher-order structures in the RNA. We will then use high-throughput computational tools to screen large libraries of existing approved drugs (which could be deployed rapidly), as well as publicly-available chemical compounds, for binding to the pseudoknot. Compounds predicted to have high binding affinity will be tested experimentally to confirm their binding-quantifying the binding affinity, identifying the binding site, and showing that binding alters the pseudoknot structural dynamics (thought to be important for triggering PRF)-and to measure their effectiveness at inhibiting PRF in cell extracts. We will examine if the effects of the compounds are specific to 2019-nCoV by repeating all measurements using other RNA structures as controls. Lead compounds will be passed on to collaborators for future studies assessing their effectiveness against live virus and suitability for deployment as therapeutics.",6,6a

We propose survey data collection and novel linkages in the UK's unique series of five national longitudinal cohort studies which have captured detailed social, economic, developmental, behavioural, attitudinal, and physical and mental health data on large representative samples since birth. The cohorts cover key life stages from late adolescence (19/20), early adulthood (30/31), mid-life (50) and older age (62, and 74). A rapid first COVID web-survey was successfully issued in-house in all five cohorts in May 2020 (n=18,148). We propose two further web surveys in August and November 2020, to capture the evolving circumstances of study participants across multiple life domains, including in health, work, and social life. This will be combined with the rich social and biomedical life course data already collected within these cohorts, to identify inequalities in the short, medium and long-term effects of the crisis, and to understand how different lifetime trajectories either mitigate or exacerbate its effects. Novel data from a COVID symptoms tracking app, and a range of geo-environmental indicators including green space and air pollution will also be linked. The latter are hypothesised to modify the mental and physical health effects of the crisis.

C21082,Digital pathology for defining myeloid cell-mediated lung injury during acute SARS CoV-2 Infection in hamsters,"Project Summary Macrophages and neutrophils are implicated in SARS CoV-2 pathogenesis in people and non-human primates but their contribution to SARS CoV-2 pathology in the hamster model is poorly defined. We hypothesize that myeloid cells can be targeted therapeutically to improve COVID-19 outcomes and we will explore this in the hamster model of COVID-19 infection. The hamster model is a tractable small animal model for COVID-19 that models severe clinical disease in humans yet, variations in study design, tissue and time-points assessed limit cross-institutional comparison of results and result reproducibility. We propose that quantitative image analysis can be used to effectively monitor immune cell infiltrates and define mechanisms of disease progression in the hamster model, but pathologic correlates of clinical disease need to be established. More broadly, there is a need to standardize quantitative pathologic endpoints in animal models of SARS CoV-2 infection in order to benchmark study quality, improve cross-institutional comparison of data, validate cellular targets, and assess therapeutic efficacy such that potential drugs for SARS CoV-2 can rapidly advance. We will use quantitative image analysis to explore mechanisms of myeloid mediated tissue damage such as antibody dependent enhancement of disease (ADE) and the PI3K inflammatory pathway. Using the Syrian hamster model and digital pathology we will assess the relative contribution of myeloid cell populations to disease pathology in SARS CoV- 2 infection and explore mechanisms of myeloid-mediated lung damage. We will develop image analysis tools to quantify inflammatory infiltrates and define pathologic correlates of clinical disease in the hamster model of SARS CoV-2 infection. We will perform titration studies to establish pathologic endpoints that correlate with clinical disease and viral load to better understand vaccine and therapeutic outcomes in this model. We will also define mechanisms of myeloid-mediated tissue damage in SARS CoV-2 infected hamsters using an optimized image analysis toolset. We will explore subtherapeutic monoclonal Ab (MAb) treatment and non-protective levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies to establish pathologic metrics for assessing iADE and use a PI3K-γ inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials for solid tumors, to determine whether myeloid cell trafficking can be modulated by inhibiting the PI3K-γ pathway. Development of validated and standardized quantitative image analysis end-points that correlate with clinical and virologic control in hamsters will more rapidly advance pre- clinical drug and vaccine efficacy trials for development of SARS CoV-2 therapeutics and preventives. These tools can also be used to explore pathologic mechanisms of disease in COVID-19. 1","1, 4","1d, 1e, 4b"

C04662,"COVID-19: TOURISM RECOVERY, RISK AND UNCERTAINTY","Tourism has been severely affected by Covid-19, and it is anticipated that it will be one of the last sectors to recover fully from the effects of the pandemic. It faces enduring tourist unwillingness to take risks when booking holidays in the face of uncertain health hazards and border/containment controls. Official estimates predict that international tourism will decline by 55% and domestic tourism by 24% in 2020, with demand remaining subdued until 2022. This matters because tourism accounts for almost 10% of UK jobs, dominates some local economies and contributes to the quality of life of individuals. This project will analyze how unprecedented Covid-19 related risks and uncertainties shape tourist intentions in the UK's inbound, outbound and domestic markets: substitution between domestic and outbound (international) tourism will also be analysed. The impacts on different market segments will be examined: on long-haul versus short-haul international tourism, and on urban versus rural versus coastal tourism destinations. Additionally, both attitudes to risk and uncertainty, and vulnerability to Covid-19, also vary by social characteristics: by age, gender, education, income and ethnicity. The research has two main stages. The first analyses large scale surveys of potential tourists in the UK and its four largest markets: Germany, France, USA, and China. Statistical modelling will provide detailed analyses of attitudes to risks and uncertainties in different elements of the tourism experience: travel versus accommodation versus visiting attractions and places of entertainment. The project will also provide an overall assessment of the determinants of tourism intentions in both the short (3 month) and the long term (to the end of 2021).  The second stage of the research analyses how individual tourist intentions would change when faced with contrasting Covid-19 health and containment scenarios. How would different types of tourists respond to continuing gradual relaxation of border and social controls as the pandemic retreats, versus a second wave leading to selective or widespread imposition of lockdown controls such as quarantine, border testing, strict social distancing rules, and closure of commercial and social venues. This research will provide a new evidence base on tourist intentions that can underpin more accurate demand forecasts, and more targeted market research and policy measures for UK tourism. The project is undertaken in collaboration with two leading tourism organizations: VisitBritain and the Association of British Travel Agents.",10,10c
P21265,NIHR Global Health Research Group on Building Partnerships for Resilience: strengthening responses to health shocks from the grassroots,AIM: To develop and strengthen an international partnership to conduct research to inform policy and practice that improves effective community-led responses to environment-related public-health crises. BACKGROUND: Human health and wellbeing face threats from increasingly frequent and disruptive shocks including outbreaks (some pandemic) of zoonotic infections (Ebola Covid19) and severe environmental change heightened by climate change that lead to changes in food security disease patterns and disasters. These challenges are interconnected yet policy and governance systems have failed to achieve holistic cross-sector responses. Unpredictability of crises makes it hard to plan for them. Social science work has shown that resilience for responding to shocks is most effectively built at community level. However no robust data exist on the mechanisms by which formal health and other sectors can engage with learn from and support resilience-building at the grassroots to develop effective health responses. Our Group will gather evidence from Ethiopia Madagascar Sierra Leone Uganda which have experienced a range of public health crises. DESIGN AND METHODS: Our multi-disciplinary comparative case-study approach will apply cutting edge combinations of social science methods across five objectives over three years:1) Synthesise evidence on how communities local health systems and other formal and informal entities have responded to health crises and with what effect :Narrative synthesis of literature from databases and websites of Government UN donor and third sector agencies. Synthesis of existing qualitative and epidemiological datasets (COVID-19; Ebola; environmental disasters and stresses) held by partners.2) Design effective approaches for public health crisis-response at grassroots: Identify common principles of effective responses; develop evaluation indicators measuring effectiveness; design prototype response models (i.e. ideal evidence-based approaches that are likely to effectively establish and sustain community-led public health responses).3) Evaluate models for effective community-led responses to public-health crises. Case studies of models identified as effective during evidence synthesis: in-depth interviews and focus groups; ethnographic work in district health offices and village communities. If outbreaks/health crises occur during project implementation we will prospectively implement and evaluate prototype approaches: same methods as for case studies.4) Formulate guidance and create dialogue with stakeholders on how to strengthen local resilience for effective responses to public health crises.5) Strengthen and consolidate sustainable partner research and management capacities to strengthen policy and practice in crisis-response.COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTCommunity engagement is central to our research questions process and results: e.g. â€œcitizen scienceâ€ approaches grassroots innovation and identifying common drivers of success. Community members will be involved and trained as volunteers/researchers.DISSEMINATIONMultiple pathways include: National (Ministries of Health Agriculture Environment other sector Ministries; Population-Health-Environment (PHE) networks); Global/Regional (academic networks; emergency response organisations; funding agencies; WHO).,9,9b

P23608,Rapid and easy- test for Coronavirus infections,"The coronavirus outbreak in 2019 (Cov-19) has challenged the global healthcare system to contain a virus with unprecedented contagious capabilities. A major aspect for controlling the Coronavirus pandemic is the implementation of tools that allow rapid screening of patients at the healthcare centers and not only. Fast and accurate diagnosis of early infections will facilitate the clinical management of the virus, and will improve patients' prognosis. The diagnostic gold standard for Coronavirus is the RNA detection of pharyngeal swab specimen by RT-PCR. However, the limitations of time, need of devices and specialized personnel to perform RT-PCR, combined with the rapid spread and universal susceptibility to the general population, make this diagnostic technique incompatible with the urgent medical needs. Moreover, the number of RT PCR kits available are limited and the production cannot cope with the high demand. The main objective of this study is to develop a rapid, easy and economical screening test for Coronavirus with the capability to achieve results in less than one hour, with high sensitivity and specificity. The test will be used to screen asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals, which can risk community transmission to population categories at a higher risk (elderly with underlying conditions, among others). Corona-Test is a lateral flow strip test similar to the well-known pregnancy test. Herein, we are aiming to validate the diagnostic accuracy and screening efficacy of Corona-Test.  This strategy could provide the means to prevent and control the disease. The objective of this project will be to bring the test to market within 12 months.",1,1a
C19715,Implementing a telemedicine and remote-mentoring platform to provide integrated noncommunicable disease and COVID-19 care in primary care facilities in rural Pakistan,"As the world struggles to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, the crisis has revealed a great deal about the gaps in global health systems, especially in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Evidence shows that patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are at higher risk of contracting Covid-19 and suffering direct and indirect consequences.  Countries are using different digital health strategies and solutions to support the public-health response to COVID-19 worldwide, including virtual clinical care, population surveillance, case identification and contact tracing for management and control of NCDs during the COVID Pandemic. There is an urgent need to strengthen primary care to screen, triage and manage NCDs and at the same time to provide home and community-based solutions to prevent community transmission of COVID-19. All people under care for NCDs are priorities for COVID-19 vaccination education and provision; as well as for identification and care of possible COVID illness.   Our study aims to implement an integrated package of care for NCD (mainly hypertension/diabetes) and COVID-19, via telemedicine and tele-mentoring platforms, in primary care facilities in rural Pakistan, and to evaluate its effectiveness using an implementation science framework. Our study is guided by the implementation science RE-AIM framework which tackles health system factors at multiple levels.  We will implement the integrated NCD-COVID care in six intervention with six health facilities matched control ones through qualitative and quantitative research methods. The study will improve health services for NCD patients who have high risk to COVID. This study fits into CIHR's Global Health Policy as it aims to improve health equity for vulnerable NCD patients facing immense challenges to accessing quality care during the pandemic.","10, 11, 12","10a, 11a, 11c, 12d"
C06116,Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) Inhalation to prevent ARDS in COVID-19 pneumonia (GI-COVID),"In December 2019, an outbreak of viral pneumonia was observed in China which developed into a pandemic. A new type of corona virus (Sars-CoV-2) is considered to be the cause of this disease, which is known as COVID-19.  In the course of COVID-19, pneumonia occurs in some cases, which can develop into an acute, life-threatening lung failure (respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS). This leads to destruction of the lung structure, which makes artificial respiration through a mask or intubation tube necessary. There is currently no specific therapy for COVID-19.     The planned randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will investigate the efficacy of the drug substance Molgramostim (trade name Molgradex®) by inhalation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.     Molgramostim promotes the formation and activation of immune cells and a similar preparation (sagramostim) is approved and used in the USA in a different dosage form in immunocompromised patients.  Preclinical studies of Molgramostim and first applications of Sagramostim in patients with severe lung infections with organ failure have shown that inhaled administration significantly enhances the immune response of the lungs while accelerating the regeneration of lung tissue.    The aim of this study is to measure whether the administration of Molgramostim (Molgradex®) compared to placebo leads to acute lung failure in fewer COVID-19 patients.",6,6h
C06103,Characterization of modulators of the angiotensin-renin system with regard to their effect on an infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CARS),"It is currently being discussed whether clinically used active ingredients such as modulators of the angiotensin-renin system could accelerate an infection with SARS-CoV-2. In order to clarify this question, a time-resolved virus infection assay will be established. The assay will help in identifying active substances that promote virus replication, in particular the effect of modulators of the angiotensin renin system on SARS-CoV-2 cell cytotoxicity. In addition, it was postulated that the ACE2 expression downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 is at least partially responsible for the permeability of the lung epithelium induced by SARS-CoV-2 and related lung injury. Therefore it should be tested whether modulators of the angiotensin-renin system affect the permeability of the epithelial tissue. Our findings can fundamentally contribute to the treatment of patients who use modulators of the angiotensin-renin-systems.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
C03003,Rapid bench-to-human development of safe and effective aerosol vaccine strategies against Covid-19 [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"The pandemic of Covid-19 caused by respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection has brought the world to a standstill. The physical-distancing strategy currently implemented in the pandemic aims to prevent the majority of Canadians from being infected by SARS-CoV-2. While this is an essential short-term strategy to save lives, it will paradoxically leave the majority of our citizens without protective immunity against Covid-19. Thus, the majority of Canadians will be susceptible to the next waves of Covid-19. The only effective way to prevent new outbreaks from getting out of control is to establish herd immunity via implementing a safe and effective vaccination program prior to the next waves of Covid-19. High-risk Canadians including healthcare workers, seniors and indigenous people are especially in need of such vaccine-induced protective immunity.        A global effort has been initiated to identify effective Covid-19 vaccines, testing a variety of vaccine platforms and strategies. Unfortunately, only a few of them are being developed and tested in Canada and almost none of them are designed to target respiratory mucosal immunity.            To fill the gap, via the effort from a multi-disciplinary McMaster Team we have been rapidly developing innovative recombinant viral-vectored Covid-19 vaccine strategies to target the desired respiratory mucosal immunity. Our Team has internationally recognized reputation in bench-to-human translational vaccine research. Particularly relevant to the proposal is our strong expertise in advanced viral vector bioengineering, vaccine efficacy testing in small animal models at CL3 facility, clinical-grade vaccine production at GMP manufacturing facility, optimized inhaled aerosol vaccine delivery method, and clinical vaccine trials. We are confident that our project will make available to Canadians a superb, needle/pain-free vaccine strategy capable of potent respiratory mucosal protection against Covid-19.",7,"7g, 7l"
C15152,Engineering protease-resistant antiviral peptide inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2,"No vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV-2 are yet available. A simple prophylactic antiviral strategy would  protect naïve individuals from infection now. In the future, when vaccines should be available, a prophylactic  antiviral will be essential for individuals who do not mount a suitable immune response. Antivirals that target  viral entry into the host cell have been proven effective against a wide range of viral diseases. The entry/fusion  process for CoV (including SARS-CoV-2) is mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (S). Concerted action  by the receptor-binding domain and the fusion domain is required for fusion. Upon viral attachment (and uptake  in certain cases), large-scale conformational rearrangements occur in the fusion domain, driven by formation of  a structure that couples protein refolding directly to membrane fusion. The formation of this structure can be  targeted by fusion inhibitory peptides (C-terminal heptad repeat or HRC peptides) that prevent proper  apposition of the HRC and HRN domains in S. We have found that conjugation of a lipid to an inhibitory  peptide directs the peptide to cell membranes and increases antiviral efficacy. Analogous lipo-peptides prevent  infection by several viruses (measles, Nipah, parainfluenza, influenza), and can be administered via the  airway. Treatment is effective for some of these even several days after infection. In addition, we have shown  that modifying the backbone of an HRC peptide via periodic replacement of α-amino acid residues with β-  amino acid residues generates α/β-peptides that retain antiviral potency (toward HIV or parainfluenza) but are  highly resistant to proteolysis. We recently generated an HRC lipopeptide that is effective against both SARS-  CoV2 and MERS live viruses in vitro, blocks spread of SARS-CoV2 in human airway tissue, and inhibits  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between ferrets in direct contact. Here we propose to combine the lipid  conjugation and backbone-modification strategies to generate potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 infection that  display a long half-life in vivo.  1. Optimize the antiviral potency and bioavailability of SARS-CoV-2 HRC peptide fusion inhibitors via  rational molecular engineering. Antiviral efficacy of α/β-lipopeptide candidates will be measured in  quantitative in vitro assays, in authentic virus infection, and in a human airway model.  2. Evaluate the protection afforded by new backbone-modified α/β-lipopeptide fusion inhibitors against  SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. Analysis of in vivo biodistribution and toxicity of backbone modified S-  CoV-2 α/β-lipopeptide fusion inhibitors and assessment of in vivo potency and resistance mechanisms will lay  the foundation for a safe and effective SARS CoV-2 fusion inhibitor for coronavirus prevention and  therapy.",6,6a
C10698,COVID-19: Implementation of virtual P.I.E.C.E.S™ for resident care planning with family to build and sustain team collaboration and resilience for the workforce in LTC,"COVID-19 restrictions resulted in profound isolation for older adult residents in long term care (LTC) homes, which exacerbated their physical, social, and mental health care needs (Chu et al., 2020). Illness due to COVID, in combination with LTC workplace challenges, also led to losses of staff and greatly impacted the mental and physical health of the remaining workforce, compounding the detrimental effects on residents (Shechtera et al. 2020). The primary goal of the proposed research is to improve pandemic preparedness, provide a workforce strategy for integrated resident care and safely engage family in care partnerships, to avoid the recurrence of the detrimental effects of the first pandemic wave. A secondary goal is to provide evidence for practices and policy and build research capacity that can be implemented in LTC homes. Facing the likelihood of future COVID-19 outbreaks coinciding with flu season, LTC homes, residents, their families, and staff need a clear strategy in place to better manage resident care. A plan that involves family members, promotes communication, and supports the resilience of Registered Practical Nurses (RPNs), the largest front-line regulated workforce, and staff so they can practice safely and effectively during a pandemic. This project, situated in two partner LTC homes, will investigate a novel virtual intervention of P.I.E.C.E.S.™ (PIECES) for team-based planning of resident care.","9, 11","9e, 11a, 11f"
C01080,"COVID-19: The local as a site of food security resilience in the times of pandemic: opportunities, challenges and ways forward.","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted on the UK's food systems, and disruptions are likely to continue. There is emerging evidence that the local food sector (local food producers and their supply chains) can significantly contribute to the resilience of the UK's food system at this time.

C07083,Genetics and quantum chemistry as tools for unknown metabolite identification,"Project Summary/Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 virus and resulting COVID-19 pandemic has created the biggest global health crisis in ourlifetime. We have assembled a team of investigators with expertise in vaccine development, environmentalexposures, immunology, metabolomics, lipidomics, and modeling to discover metabolic predictive biomarkers(MPBs) of infection in ferrets. We will use ferrets, because they have already been shown to be an effectiveanimal model for human COVID-19 disease, and they are currently being used for vaccine development.Our study builds upon an NIH funded co-infection study in which ferrets will be infected with 4 different commonrespiratory viruses before infection by SARS-CoV-2. That study will determine the severity of infections andimmune responses, but it did not include metabolomics measurements. The hypothesis of the co-infections isthat the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be attenuated with co-infection by another virus. We will be addinga group of ferrets that will be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) prior to infection by SARS-CoV-2. PFAS have been shown to suppress the immune system in mice, and a limited number of studies havedemonstrated associations between severity of virus infection and levels of PFAS. PFAS bioaccumulate intissues and are common chemicals used in many everyday items such as plastic bottles and non-stick cookingpans, so this common environmental exposure could be an important variable in COVID-19 symptoms. Theferret model provides an ideal way to study the effect of PFAS on SARS-CoV-2 infection progression andoutcomes. For each group in the study (co-infection, PFAS, or control), 15 serum samples will be collected fromeach animal (n=6 for each group) over about 1 month, with SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring at the midpoint ofthe sampling. Thus, we will be able to derive detailed time-course measurements of metabolites and lipids andassociate these signals with phenotypic outcomes.We have 3 specific aims: 1) Conduct the co-infection and PFAS exposure studies in BSL-3 containment andcollect immunological and infectivity data. Serum samples will be collected and inactivated by a biosafety-approved protocol. 2) Measure metabolites and lipids using non-targeted LC-MS and NMR. NMR is faster andless expensive and will be used to prioritize samples for LC-MS. Background PFAS signals from animal housingequipment will be determined. 3) Model the metabolites and lipids with phenotypic outcomes. We will also modelthe influence of PFAS exposure on the lipidome to better understand the molecular mechanisms of PFASimmunotoxicity.We have also started a Slack workspace for communication between different groups around the worldworking on COVID-19 metabolomics. This workspace provides for sharing of protocols and data, posting thelatest research in this area, as well as a forum for questions and answers.

Self-employed cancer survivors remain an understudied group with the majority of the literature focusing on salaried cancer survivors, despite self-employed workers accounting for 15% of the Canadian workforce. The lack of research on self-employed survivors means that the barriers and facilitators of remaining or returning to work following cancer remain relatively unknown. The study will be completed by interviewing 25 Canadian self-employed cancer survivors who have remained or returned to work following a cancer diagnosis. Data will be collected during semi-structured phone or zoom interviews of 45 to 60 minutes will be conducted guided by the Vocational Rehabilitation Model for cancer survivors. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and a continuous, comparative method will be used to code and analyze data of the 25 interviews. The goal of the study is to describe the unique experiences and strategies of self-employed Canadian cancer survivors with remaining or returning to work following cancer. Interviews will explore (1) the overall experiences while remaining at or returning to work; (2) work-related barriers and facilitating factors while remaining at or returning to work; (3) work accommodations employed to address the barriers; and (4) the impact of COVID-19 on cancer survivors ability to remain or return to work.

As of February 18 2020, 73,439 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in 29 countries around the world with an attributed 1,875 deaths. The World Health Organization recently declared COVID-19 as a global health emergency. Studies on H1N1 and other pandemics show that Indigenous communities in Canada suffered most from these diseases. Responses to H1N1 were often inadequate and at worst created more harm than good. Communities had poor access to medical experts and supplies. Indigenous organizations were mostly excluded from decision-making. And misinformation generated much fear that still persists today. Yet, many Indigenous communities and organizations also responded effectively and, with others, eventually found ways to reduce the impacts of H1N1. The outbreak of COVID-19 thus represents a critical moment. On one hand the same mistakes could be made, with similar impacts. On the other hand, there is an opportunity to do things differently in ways that are grounded in the priorities of Indigenous communities and organizations. The goal of this project is to evaluate the implications of past and existing responses to pandemics with respect to Indigenous communities across Canada and to address any gaps in understanding and support related to COVID-19 and future pandemics. This collaborative project will focus on the past by documenting experiences with other pandemics and explore changes in response over time. It will focus on the present by assessing current state of community emergency planning and risk communication. Finally, it will focus on the future by assessing community responses to different possible scenario and ideas for moving forward.

C09556,A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,"Summary - Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisysteminflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow apresentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasakidisease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear andwhether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fiercedebates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in thepast for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. Inthis study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and createsalient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2),and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models forKD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate theperformance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosisand management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study wewill include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless ofwhether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for buteventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted datawill be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping andbiomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used toestablish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In thefollowing 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real-time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for futuredeployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with theInternational Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD andpediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites.More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasibleand perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data sciencemethods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-Cpatients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and willmore rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C.",4,4c

Significant questions remain  regarding the inter-epidemic maintenance of RVFV in endemic countries, and the ecological importance of  North American mosquitoes in the establishment and transmission of RVFV. In particular, RVFV is currently  believed to be maintained in natural mosquito vector populations through vertical transmission, however  published laboratory evidence documenting this phenomenon is completely lacking. We recently demonstrated  high RVFV dissemination rates and infection of ovarian tissues in both Ae. aegypti and Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes  orally exposed to an epidemic strain of RVFV from Kenya. The infection rate of the 1st instar larvae of Cx.  tarsalis mosquitoes was 87% (Bergren, preliminary data). This is the first time transovarial transmission of  RVFV has been experimentally demonstrated in any mosquito species. Interestingly, transstadial transmission  of RVFV from eggs to F1 adult life stages was inhibited in Ae. aegypti due to an unknown mechanism. This  project will address the hypotheses that the efficiency of transstadial transmission of RVFV is mediated by  larval habitat temperature (Aim 1), as well as mosquito anti-viral effectors and Wnt signalling during immature  developmental stages (Aim 2). For Aim 1, both Cx. tarsalis and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes derived from RVFV-  infected parental mosquitoes will be reared at low (18Ã'Â°C) standard (28Ã'Â°C), and high (35Ã'Â°C) temperatures.  Transstadial virus persistence in each mosquito species will be quantified by qRT-PCR and plaque titration of  1st instar, 4th instar, pupal, and F1 adult mosquitoes reared at each temperature. Statistical analysis of infection  rates as well as virus titer in each life stage as a function of mosquito species and temperature will inform  whether or not larval rearing temperature significantly influences transstadial persistence of RVFV. To support  these environmental data, RNA-Seq will be employed in Aim 2 to identify the underlying molecular pathways  contributing to our preliminary phenotypic observations. Differential gene expression will be analyzed in  individual mosquitoes of each species throughout the developmental process. The function of top-candidate  genes during RVFV transstadial transmission will be confirmed by specific double-stranded RNA knock-down  in mosquito larvae. The data generated in these studies will collectively elucidate environmental and molecular  drivers of RVFV persistence in North American mosquito populations. This project will also directly address  shortcomings in current predictive models regarding the environmental persistence and establishment potential  of RVFV in mosquitoes.","1, 2","1b, 2b"
P22291,Next generation mosquito control through technology-driven trap development and artificial intelligence guided detection of mosquito breeding habitats,"Project Summary  Each year, approximately 400 million people are infected with an arboviral disease from the bite of an Aedes  spp mosquito. Aedes spp. mosquitoes are a leading public health threat due to their high competency to vector  multiple pathogens, their preference to bite humans, and their ability to adapt to new domestic environments. In  the US, reintroduction and establishment of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito populations has  resulted in local epidemics of Zika, dengue and chikungunya in the past decade. Unfortunately, mosquito control  programs in the US generally operate with limited budgets, forcing the majority of insecticide spraying to be  conducted in reaction to population exposure instead of targeted prevention, which has also contributed to  considerable growth of insecticide resistant populations, yielding a widening gap of infrastructure vulnerability.  Our current proposal aims to leverage existing technologies from non-health disciplines to advance mosquito  detection and abatement. We propose to validate the use of technology-driven mosquito traps that allow for high-  throughput identification and counting of Aedes mosquitos at various life stages to inform decision making when  selecting areas for insecticide spraying and abatement. Additionally, we propose to develop rigorous remote  sensing workflows for identification of neighborhood-level Aedes abundance risk and rapid detection of individual  Aedes mosquito breeding habitats on a household-level. This innovative proposal uses multi-year and real-world  mosquito data from two different metropolitan areas to statistically adjust for variances in geographic ecologies,  urban microclimates, seasonal climate patterns, and annual weather events. Our study will result in low-cost  tools immediately ready for broad distribution and integration by vector control agencies nationally. The  outcomes of our study have promise to directly impact vector control agencyÃ¢Â€Â™s decision-making processes for  mosquito trapping site selection, inform preventative abetment protocols, and shorten the time required for  mosquito collection and identification. Further, integration of our proposed technology traps and informed site  selection maps will increase overall collection volumes while preserving scarce resources for local vector control  agencies. This proposal has the potential to create a paradigm shift in how we approach vector control globally,  with a targeted intervention resulting in significant economic, environmental, and clinical benefits.",2,2c
C20517,Multiple social tie transitions and their impact on cardiometabolic risk factors in aging women and men (MORE),"Social connectedness is important for promoting healthy aging among Canadians. In particular, measures of social connectedness such as marital status are linked to greater survival and less chronic disease. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has really highlighted the importance of social ties, older people are especially at high risk of transitioning from multiple to few or no social ties, and this can threaten health differently in women versus men. However, there is very little research examining whether and how changes in different social ties influence the biological indicators of aging, or how their effects vary for women and men. Our preliminary work suggests that marital status, social participation, social networks and living arrangement are more strongly linked to linked to obesity and hypertension in women than men in Canada. Far less is known about whether economic circumstances alter the importance of social connectedness for cardiovascular risk. To fill these critical knowledge gaps, the current project will build on our initial work to (1) assess changes in obesity and hypertension over time in women and men by types of social tie transitions; (2) quantify how changes in different social ties impact these healthy aging indicators; and (3) explore the role of financial autonomy in social connectedness and cardiovascular risk. Using established techniques, we take a unique approach of looking at sex/gender, which is typically given less attention in cardiovascular research. The results will have implications for decision-makers who shape tailored, evidence-driven policies, services and programs that promote social connections and engagement among Canadians in order to advance our national healthy aging strategy. ",10,"10a, 10b"
C00040,Development of a rapid point-of-care diagnostic test for COVID-19 [Supplement added: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"This research addresses the urgent need of rapid point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19. The collaborative research is conducted by a multi-disciplinary team of virologists, chemists, infectious disease specialists, front-line practitioners, and public health researchers from the University of Alberta, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Wuhan Institute of Virology (China).  The immediate priority focuses on developing two complementary techniques to be performed on-site and in resource-limited settings, in support of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnostic innovation takes advantage of the most recent advances in chemistry, molecular biology, genome technology, and nanotechnology. Chemical reactions required for efficient amplification and sensitive detection of the viral RNA take place in a single tube at a moderate temperature, simplifying the operation procedures. The specific reaction products are visible to the naked eyes, thus eliminating the need for any elaborate equipment. The first test reads color changes, with red color indicating negative and blue color indicating positive. Readout for the second test is color band on paper strips, similar to those of pregnancy tests, with two red bands indicating positive whereas a single control band indicating negative. The mid-term priority focuses on validating and evaluating the new diagnostic tests for field applications in the epidemic center of COVID-19. Our team members in Wuhan who currently perform the standard diagnostic tests will lead this effort. Once validated and approved, the new diagnostic tools will be used to support screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 at the community level. The mid-term objective also includes adapting the point-of-care diagnostics at other collaborating sites, e.g., Karachi (Pakistan) and Nairobi (Kenya). A longer-term priority of this research includes refining the new diagnostic tools to enable monitoring of mutational changes of the virus as it continues to evolve.",1,1a
P22240,Defining Molecular Epitopes of Protective Antibodies to Flaviviruses,"Project Summary/Abstract:  The objective of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Award Application is to provide Dr. Alena Markmann  with a strong foundation in human immunology and the latest methods for studying human immune cells before  launching her independent research career on the human immune response to RNA viruses. Dr. Markmann is  an Assistant Professor of Medicine, tenure track, at the University of North Carolina -Chapel Hill (UNC) School  of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. The candidate has  expertise in and a strong track record of publications on antibody structure, antibody-antigen interactions and  antibody neutralization of viruses. By strengthening her knowledge of adaptive immunity to RNA viruses and  mastering the latest methods for analyzing antigen specific B cells, Dr. Markmann will study how the human  immune response to emerging flaviviruses like dengue and Zika can suppress viral infection and disease or  enhance viral replication and exacerbate disease. The candidate and her mentor Dr. Aravinda de Silva have  designed a training plan that includes a rigorous research component along with didactic instruction, networking  and presentation opportunities, team management skills as well as manuscript writing and grantsmanship.  Together these skills will establish the methods and principles necessary for successful career development.  Flaviviruses are enveloped positive stranded RNA viruses that pose a growing threat to the human population  and cause millions of infections annually. They are vector-borne, transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes, and cause  a spectrum of disease manifestations including febrile illness, encephalitides that can cause lifelong  complications, Congenital Zika Syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes. For the most  part, flaviviral infection result in a neutralizing protective antibody response against the infecting virus, that can  last for years after infection. The four dengue viruses however are very similar antigenically and in many cases,  result in generating a broad cross-neutralizing antibody responseto dengue virus serotypes that individuals have  not yet been exposed to. Thus far, no one has identified the viral target site of these broadly neutralizing dengue  antibodies that exist in the serum. Furthermore, though we know of a few major targets of the Zika protective  antibody response from studying memory B cells, we do not know what the serum targets are. Preliminary results  suggest that in the case of Zika serum antibody responses, binding targets are correlated with known strongly  neutralizing memory B cell-derived antibody targets. Thus, we hypothesize in Aim 1, that serum antibody  responses will mirror memory B cell responses, but will likely come from a smaller number of B cell clones and  be less cross-reactive with other flaviviruses. In Aim 2 we will identify the viral binding targets of broadly cross-  neutralizing dengue antibodies from the serum. These studies will result in the ident ification of critical protective  viral targets to both dengue and Zika viruses from the serum antibody compartment in order to inform successful  vaccine design.",1,1d
P22397,Understanding mosquito movement and its relevance to control through genetic analysis,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose a major global health burden  through much of the world, despite the widespread distribution of insecticide-based tools and antimalarial  drugs. Consequently, there is interest in novel strategies to control these diseases, including the release of  genetically sterile male mosquitoes, mosquitoes transfected with Wolbachia, and mosquitoes engineered with  gene drive systems. The safety and effectiveness of these strategies and considerations regarding trial design  and implementation are critically dependent upon a detailed understanding of mosquito movement at both fine  and broad spatial scales, yet there are major gaps in our understanding of these movement patterns. The  declining cost of genome sequencing and novel methods for analyzing geocoded genomic data provide  opportunities to address these knowledge gaps. In this project, we propose to devise a robust approach for  inferring fine-scale mosquito dispersal patterns and their impact on innovative vector control strategies. We  propose to use in silico simulations of mosquito ecology and preliminary geocoded mosquito genomic data  collected from Fresno, California to determine sampling routines capable of quantifying dispersal patterns,  population sizes and mating patterns using genetic kinship analyses (Aim 1). Results from these analyses will  iteratively inform sampling schemes for two rounds of subsequent collections of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito  vector of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, in Yishun, Singapore (Aim 2). Genome sequencing and  kinship analyses will be used to quantify Ae. aegypti movement patterns, population sizes and mating  behaviors at this location, and to parameterize spatially-structured 3D models of Ae. aegypti population  dynamics. The resulting models will be used to explore biosafety, trial design and implementation  considerations for novel vector control strategies including: i) population suppression systems such as  Wolbachia-infected males and genetically sterile males, and ii) population replacement systems such as  population transfection with Wolbachia, localized systems such as chromosomal translocations, and non-  localized systems such as homing-based gene drive (Aim 3). We expect the proposed research to lead to the  development of greatly enhanced surveillance strategies to infer fine-scale mosquito movement patterns and  other demographic parameters, and to help inform the safe application of several novel and highly promising  strategies for the control of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses and other devastating mosquito-borne  diseases.",2,2b
C06405,A new digital deal for an inclusive post-COVID-19 social compact: developing digital strategies for social and economic reconstruction,"For many people around the world, digital technologies have enabled the continuation of work, education, and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. But for half the world's population who cannot connect to the internet, the pandemic has put a renewed spotlight on the uneven access to and distribution of digital technologies globally. This enduring digital divide undermines governments' abilities to harness technologies for the efficient and safe delivery of necessary services online, and that in turn means education, commerce, and relief support is not accessible for many who need it most.    This project will study the linkages between the informal economy and the digital transformation of governance. Among the issues under examination are the potential to ""formalize"" small firms and thus increase the tax base that funds social protection; the impact of digital services during lockdown and eventual recovery; the factors that undermine digital access; and the role of democratic governance and accountability. The project aims to inform policy debates on the role of digitalization in the management of disasters and pandemics, and the economic and social reconstruction of emerging economies. It will provide immediate signals to policymakers on the strengths and deficiencies of current response strategies and help create conditions for economic recovery through improved information flows and efficiencies associated with digitization.    The project will involve six countries: Colombia, India, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, and Sri Lanka, and will generate comparisons with other countries in those regions.",10,"10c, 10d"
C19502,Bioethanol and hand sanitizer production from sugar cane molasses to quickly respond to their local increasing demand towards COVID-19 pandemic.,"A: Background This project intends to assess feasibility of producing Aloe vera-based hand sanitizers using bioethanol from sugar cane molasses and other vegetable by-products to mitigate Covid- 19 pandemic. By using hand sanitizer, it is a convenient way and less time consuming to ensuring hand hygiene which will lessen the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. The requirement of hand sanitizers is expected to continue for an extended time. Thus, the ethanol availability has to be ensured in order to help people meet the demand for adequate hand hygiene. Because of Covid-19 pandemic the need for sanitizers is higher, yet availability is low or high cost. Yet the production of bioethanol from edible agricultural products may cause rise of cost of these crops leading to food insecurity. Bioethanol derived from agriculture waste, which is most abundant at global level, is the best option. B: Goals and Objectives The overarching goal of this research project is to assess feasibility of production, and operationalize a bioethanol plant and to develop Aloe vera-based hand sanitizers. Specific objectives: i To install and operationalize a bioethanol processing plant at NIRDA Research Center in Huye District; ii To initiate the bio-ethanol production from sugar cane molasses and other vegetable by-products for a standardized hand sanitizers production; iii To formulate Aloe vera-based hand sanitizers and conduct its efficacy and safety evaluation C: Methods and Materials We will initiate a bioethanol processing unit. The NIRDA ethanol pilot plant stopped after 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. A pilot plant was re-operated up to 2007. However, because of some important parts were completely damaged, NIRDA bioethanol production plant ceased its activities. We will use sugar cane molasses from Kabuye Sugar works, which are not valued and are regarded as by-products and considered as waste or simply used as source of energy. This molasses are important key materials for bioethanol production. The combination of Aloe vera gel with glycerol and propylene glycol at appropriate proportion will be used as humectant. The Aloe vera will be supplied by local cultivation companies and processed in NIRDA. Other excipients including: • The fermentative yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nutrients and citric acid for ethanol production • Carbomer powder which is used as clear gel thickner, emulsion stabilizer and suspending agent • Glycerol which is used as humectant, moisturizing, emollient, skin softening. Skin repairing, prevent skin barrier from drying • Methyl paraben, methyl/Propyl parahydroxybenzoate which is used as antimicrobial agent designed for preservation of a wide range of cosmetics, toiletriess and topical pharmaceuticals. • Triethanolamine which is used as pH adjuster The Procedure will be as follows: • We will use molasses from the tanks diluted with water to obtain the sugar concentration around 10-15%, • We will use a yeast culture tank, with nutrition supply of ammonium and magnesium phosphate or sulfate, • We will use diluted and treated molasses and the yeast from storage fed to the fermentation chamber, • Fermentation takes around 30-70 hours based on the pH, temperature and sugar concentration • The rectification process will be used to produce 95% ethanol Activities and Milestones Some of planned activities in the project are following as shown at Fig 1 below: • Organization of first research meeting • Conducting the technical Audit by planning & monitoring team • Preparation of MoU and contracts for equipment, excipients and raw material acquisition • Aloe vera planting materials acquisition • Bioethanol formulation from sugar cane molasses • Aloe vera gel-based hand sanitizer formulation D: Expected outcomes The expected outcomes are the following: • Bioethanol processing plant installed and operationalized; • Bioethanol with pharmaceutical grade produced; • Aloe vera-based hand sanitizers formulated and produced",5,5b

C15208,Human Airway Biomimetics for RSV and Other Respiratory Viruses,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Project 2  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major global respiratory pathogen. The Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented crisis. Respiratory virus  infections are often accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, but how respiratory pathogens cause GI  disease is not understood. Moreover, a number of vaccines and therapeutics are being developed against these  important pathogens, however, the existing models do not recapitulate the human experience. Small animal and  non-human primate models fall short of mimicking human disease, and the human RSV challenge model is  expensive and raises safety concerns. The requirement for BSL-3 facilities to study SARS-CoV-2 hampers data  generation and increases cost. The human endemic CoV-NL63 can serve as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 because  it uses the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This project will develop an ex-vivo Human  Challenge Airway Model by advancing our current 3-dimensional (3D) nose/lung model for studies on  RSV and CoV-NL63 (proxy for SARS-CoV-2) to address the urgent need for a preclinical model that  recapitulates the human disease. In collaboration with the Human Biomimetic Scientific Core, we have  developed the expertise for isolating stems cells and generating 3D nose and lung organoid lines from nasal  wash and bronchoalveolar fluids, respectively. Our internationally recognized expertise in RSV and other  respiratory viruses uniquely positions us to develop advanced 3D nose/lung models for dissecting the  pathogenesis of RSV (Aim 1), and develop airway and GI platforms with the Engineering Micro-Environment  Core (EMEC) to evaluate molecular mechanisms driving the lung-gut axis of respiratory virus disease (Aim 2).  We will select donors based on sex and age so that we can comprehensively study the complex interactions of  host (age, sex, distinct airway sites, and immune cells) and virus, and the contribution of humoral and cellular  immune responses in an HLA-restricted system. We will also evaluate the lung-gut axis by studying the  downstream effects of RSV and CoV-NL63 airway infection on the GI tract by either direct (infection) or indirect  (inflammation) pathways using lung-gut flow systems. This project is responsive to the RFA by the development  of an advanced nose/lung model with increased complexity that includes humoral and cellular immunity, as well  as defining novel mechanistic pathways in the lung-gut axis of respiratory virus disease. The global scientific  community will benefit immensely from a 3-D nose/lung airway-virus model that recapitulates human virus  infection and serves as a platform to evaluate therapeutics and vaccines.",1,1e
C09642,NASAL CARRIAGE OF VIRULENT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS: A POSSIBLE CO-MORBIDITY OF COVID-19,"BACKGROUND  Coronavirus diseases-19 (COVID-19), caused by a coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a respiratory disease. The disease was first reported in China in December 2019, and has currently spread to most part of the world resulting to a global pandemic. There are currently no vaccine and specific antiviral drug recommended for COVID-19 treatment; however, the disease can be successfully managed by treating specific symptoms such as the use of fluids to reduce dehydration risk, medication to reduce fever, and oxygen therapy for respiratory failure [1,2].    Most people with this disease exhibit mild to moderate symptoms and fully recover without special medications; however, elderly people and people with other co-morbidities like cardiovascular diseases, asthma, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and the immunocompromised develop more severe illness leading to fatality [1-3]. Though these conditions are the most commonly reported conditions influencing COVID-19 severity, bacterial superinfection may also affect the severity of disease.   In the SARS-CoV epidemic of 2003, an increased rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported from the pre-SARS to the SARS period [2].  In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a case-fatality of a French man in his thirties with no underlying medical conditions has been reported [4]. Investigations into the cause of the severe symptoms seen in this patient showed the presence of a cytotoxin producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus which was inducing necrotizing pneumonia in the patient, leading to his death [4]. Considering the similarities already reported between the 2003 coronavirus infection and this SARS-CoV-2 infection [5], there is a need to assess the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in COVID-19 patients, and its treatment be considered to reduce risk of superinfection and ultimately the severity of disease in patients with COVID-19.    AIMS   Staphylococcus aureus is a human commensal that causes community-acquired and nosocomial infection. The increase in the resistance of this bacterium to antibiotics makes it of great clinical importance. Nasal carriage of S. aureus are reported to increase the risk of acquiring both community and hospital-acquired infections, and are particularly implicated in bronchopulmonary infection, causing both upper and lower respiratory tract infection [6, 7]. The prevalence of nasal carriage of staphylococcus is high in Nigeria even in apparently healthy people [8-9]. There is currently a paucity of data on the different comorbidities that might vary in different populations with COVID-19. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the association of nasal carriage of S. aureus and its association with COVID-19.  The objectives of this study are:  1.	To determine the nasal carriage rate of S. aureus among suspected patients presented for SARS-CoV-2 screening   2.	To evaluate antibiotics resistance patterns in the identified S. aureus strains.  3.	To examine the association between nasal S. aureus carriage and SARS-COV-2 infection.  4.	To assess the prevalence and distribution of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among the S. aureus strains.  5.	To type isolates into the different S. aureus protein A types    STUDY DESIGN  The study will be a quantitative study using a cross-sectional research design. The target population for this study will include individuals who present for SARS-CoV-2 testing at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research drive through COVID-19 testing centre.  The inclusion criterion for this target population is that they are willing to participate in the study.  The sample size for this study was estimated using the formula for single proportion. With Z set at p<0.05 = 1.96, d at 0.05, and the expected proportion in the population based on a previous studies was set at 57% [9]. The estimated sample size was 380 based on this calculation. Convenience sampling will be used to recruit participants into the study.   The two anterior nares of the participant will be swabbed using a sterile swab moistened with normal saline following all safety guidelines. The samples will immediately be plated on mannitol salt agar and nutrient agar and incubated within two hours of collection at 37ºC for 18 - 24 hours. The swab stick will also be transferred into a lysis buffer containing guanidine isothiocyanate for viral inactivation and transported to the laboratory for direct molecular detection of S. aureus. Isolates will be identified using colony morphology, gram staining, slide agglutination and tube coagulase test, and molecular amplification of the 16s rRNA gene specific to S. aureus.   Pure isolates will be subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method as recommended by Kirby-Bauer method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) criteria with the following antibiotics: Gentamicin (10µg), Augmentin (30µg), Streptomycin (10µg), Tetracycline (10µg), Cotrimoxazole (25µg), Cloxacillin (5µg), Chloramphenicol (10µg), Erythromycin (5µg), Imipenem (10µg), Cefuroxime (30µg), Amoxycillin (10µg), Rifampicin (5µg), Cefoxitin (30µg), Methicillin (5µg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), Ofloxacin (5µg), ceftriaxone (30μg) ceftazidime (30μg), vancomycin (30µg) and azithromycin (15µg). Sensitivity will be read after 24 hours incubation at 35º-37º C. Isolates will be regarded as sensitive or resistant according to the CLSI criteria [10].  DNA will be isolated from all identified isolates and directly from the swab samples using a commercial DNA extraction kit. The mecA and the SCCmec typing will be done using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) method as previously described [11]. The panton valentine leucocidin (pvl) toxin has been associated with necrotizing pneumonia in children [12, 13]. The virulence of the S. aureus will be evaluated with regards to pvl using PCR methods as previously described [13]. The isolates will also be typed into the different S. aureus protein A (spa) types using methods as previously described [14].  Statistical analysis will be done using SPSS version 20.0.  Chi square analysis will be carried out to determine if there is a significant association between the presence of S. aureus and SARS-CoV-2 detection and also if there is an association between the presence of virulent S. aureus strains and COVID-19 severity.  Ethical considerations  Ethical approval will be obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. Apart from the nasal swabs, demographic information such as age and gender of the participants will be collected. Though no identifying information will be collected from the participants, the result of the COVID-19 screening and severity of the diseases in the participant will also be required.    MAXIMISING THE IMPACT OF RESEARCH OUTPUTS  Collaborations will be made with relevant experts to improve the research output of this project. This will involve collaborating with laboratory technicians, microbiologists and virologists involved in COVID-19 research. The result of this study will be sent to the head of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research so as to influence health policies by the federal ministry of health. Additionally, the result of this study will be published in open access, peer-reviewed journals, and will also be presented in local and international conferences    EXPECTED OUTCOMES  Considering the increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the fact that Nigeria already has a high prevalence of nasal carriage of S. aureus even in apparently healthy people, it is expected that the nasal carriage of virulent S. aureus may influence the severity of COVID-19. The result of this study may help highlight the need to assess the presence of nasal carriage of S. aureus as comorbidity in COVID-19 patients, and consider the treatment of S. aureus co-infection in COVID-19 patients as a means to reduce the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.

C07249,FIU Center for Reducing Health Disparities in Substance Abuse & HIV in South Florida (1),"SUMMARY Background: The United States (US) remains one of the epicenters of the global COVID-19 public health emergency, resulting in the government's implementation of mitigation policies to stem and contain the virus.Despite these measures, people of color (POC - Blacks, Latinx and American Indian/Alaska Native populations) in the US are disproportionately represented in the epidemic.     Objectives: The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of macro and ecological policies by (a) using state and county level data to report on COVID-19 health outcomes experienced by communities of color and (b) conducting in-depth interviews among community members and providers to understand their perceptions about accessing and providing healthcare services.     Design: Firstly, there will be an ecological study at the US state and county levels examining the relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 outcomes, considering selected COVID-19 risk factors (crowding, poverty level, percentage of essential workers) as moderators in that relationship.     Secondly, there will be a policy study of differences on timing, interpretation and implementationof federal and state level mitigation policies on COVID-19 outcomes.     Finally, interviews will be conducted to understand provider and patient viewpoints about how macro level social and health policies implemented by federal and local governments influence providers' perception about delivery of care and community members'perception about accessing COVID-19 healthcare services.     Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe COVID-19 prevalence by racial/ethnic density in states and counties, followed by bivariate correlations. Any statistically significant correlation (<0.10) in the bivariate correlations will be incorporated intothe regression models with COVID-19 incidence, prevalence and death rate as outcomes. Regression models will be used to determine the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and state and county level demographic data and COVID-19 policy data. For the interviews, content analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data about perceived barriers and facilitators accessing and providing care.     Significance: The results of this study will help to understand the underpinnings of social mechanisms and disparities contributingto the overrepresentation of underrepresented minority populations in the COVID-19 public health crisis. The study objectives are in line with recent NIMHD priorities issued for the COVID-19 response to support studies that investigate the ""influence of state and local mitigation policies on differences in health services utilization and health outcomes, the role of community-level protective factors and interventions in mitigating the adverse consequences of the sector disruptions caused by the outbreak, the influence of COVID-19-related racism andother types of discrimination, and the role of social determinants of health in influencing preventive health behaviors"".","3, 9, 10","3b, 3c, 3d, 9a, 9e, 10a"
C00406,COVID-19: Outreach to Domestic Abuse Victims in Times of Quarantine,"Police reports suggest that domestic abuse (DA) has risen as a result of the pandemic, yet there is concern that the share of DA incidents reported may have fallen. When a victim and abuser are quarantined together, calling the police may jeopardize the victim's safety. As a result, greater numbers of victims are increasingly isolated and at risk. So how can victims get help?  How can authorities let them know what options are available? Direct messaging can be dangerous, since texts from the police may provoke a controlling abuser. We propose a targeted social media campaign to inform potential high-risk victims about the Silent Solution, a safer option for contacting police.  Our approach leverages the wide use of social media, which also poses less risk than direct messaging. Whereas text messages are actively sent, social media adverts are passively received. The study will identify potential high-risk victims and randomly select half for the media campaign. Analysis of DA calls will show whether the approach is effective.  If so, it will provide an approach for reaching isolated DA victims, and for giving them options to get help, that will be of value both during quarantine and beyond.",10,10b
P21572,Investigation of the role of phosphatidic acid metabolism in filovirus budding,"Lipid enveloped viruses replicate and bud from the host cell where they acquire their lipid coat. Filoviruses are lipid-enveloped viruses that have a filamentous lipid-envelope and despite being discovered more than 40 years ago, not much is known on how they acquire their lipid coat. These viruses bud from the plasma membrane of the host cell and cause viral hemorrhagic fever with up to a 90% fatality rate. Filoviruses include Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), which are classified as category A pathogens by the NIH as they pose a serious public health and national security risk. These viruses harbor a negative sense RNA genome that encodes seven genes. The viral matrix protein VP40, which regulates budding from the host cell membrane, underlies the viral lipid envelope. VP40 is a peripheral protein and the only protein required from these viruses to form filamentous virus like particles that are nearly indistinguishable from authentic virions. Since little is known about how VP40 interacts with biological membranes, many fundamental questions about Filovirus assembly and budding remain unanswered. Preliminary studies demonstrate that a host cell enzyme, phospholipase D, is required for sufficient viral particle release and VP40 particle displacement at the plasma membrane. Phospholipase D is an enzyme that uses phosphatidylcholine as a substrate to generate the anionic lipid phosphatidic acid (PA). Preliminary studies also demonstrate that VP40 protein expression in human cells is sufficient to increase cellular levels of PA. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the host enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) plays an essential role in the late stage budding of filoviruses. This R21 application describes experiments to provide a cohesive cellular and biochemical model of the role of PLD activity and PA generation in Filovirus budding. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the role of PLD activity and PA generation in the cellular assembly and budding of EBOV and MARV. We will elucidate the potential for inhibition of synthesis of this glycerophospholipid to inhibit Filovirus budding. Experiments with a BSL-4 collaborator will also test this hypothesis against authentic EBOV and MARV. Specific aim 2 will investigate the mechanism by which PA stabilizes VP40 oligomers and the molecular origin of PA binding by VP40. Quantitative measurements in our live cell BSL-2 surrogate system will determine the kinetics of VLP assembly and release and the role of PLD activity and PA generation in stabilizing VP40 oligomers at the plasma membrane for the scission process. The molecular origins of PA binding will be investigated using strong rationale of lipid-protein interactions and the known VP40 structures. Taken together, these studies should produce new and important mechanistic insight into how Filovirus particles form from the plasma membrane of cells.",1,1b
C07779,"CORONA - NuForm - Proximity despite distance - new forms of encounter communication in museum space; subproject 2: Visitor behavior, formats and indicators (of knowledge transfer).","Encounter communication in museums, visitor centers, show rooms, cultural institutions or at exhibitions/fairs is inherently linked to spatio-temporal contact - with staff, exhibits, other visitors. Hygiene requirements, distance rules and visitor/travel restrictions in a corona context therefore create special challenges for encounter communication. The NuForm project is specifically looking for approaches and options that are not merely acutely effective in relation to the crisis, but for measures that have potential for sustainable benefits for visitors and operators of encounter communication that extend beyond the crisis. In some cases, completely new solutions must be designed and implemented, and the process of digital transformation must be accelerated significantly. Using the example of museum visits under pandemic conditions, the project will investigate which factors play a decisive role in encounter communication, how individual factors can be substituted or overcompensated for with digital and virtual means, and which new possibilities can arise from a hybridization of real and virtual offerings. In particular, contactless and hygienic forms of interaction will be considered, as well as concepts for virtual visits, for the intersection of real and virtual encounters, for personalized visitor guidance, and for the expansion of the museum space. The two partners in the research program are approaching these questions from two different perspectives. The Museum für Naturkunde is investigating the factors and effects of different communication formats along a gradient from real to virtual with regard to visitor behavior and addressing different sub-publics.",5,5b

C20537,Evidence synthesis and knowledge mobilization to advance 'Health in All Policies' in Canada,"Good health has more to do with the circumstances in which we live, work, grow, and play than with factors commonly linked with health, such as healthcare services or a nutritious diet. Addressing these factors and their influence on health outcomes requires an approach to health policy that works across sectors beyond 'health'. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified differences in social, economic conditions, and illustrates how addressing these differences requires a whole-of-society and whole-of-government response Health in All Policies (HiAP) is one such approach, where different government sectors work together around health. The Intersectoral Partnerships and Initiatives team (IPI) within the Public Health Agency of Canada(PHAC) is looking to benefit from research about how best to take up key lessons from HiAP into its work. Addressing this challenge will strategically inform IPI's current and future partnerships, and support its efforts to improve the circumstances in which we live, work, grow, and play the most effective ways possible. Using data and evidence available on HIAP, the project will develop evidence-based tools and materials for the Intersectoral Partnerships and Initiatives team to use in facilitating more effective collaboration and more strategic partnerships with non-health sector government departments. The project will also mobilize learnings within government and across sectors; both directly (i.e., through presentations to different public health and allied audiences about the review and its findings), and indirectly (i.e., through adopting and encouraging the use of my findings and tools in my day-to-day work as an HSI fellow and policy analyst on the IPI team). ","10, 11","10b, 11e"
P24930,UC Davis - Rift Valley fever,"CEPI to invest $28.5 million, with support from the EU, in UC Davis-led clinical trials of a Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine in Tanzania, a country at high-risk of outbreaks of the disease.  Potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus causes great damage to lives and livelihoods, primarily in rural communities in low- and middle-income countries across Africa and beyond.  As climate change expands the range of potential RVF outbreaks, trials will meet urgent need for vaccine development progress.    14 September 2023, OSLO Norway and DAVIS, California: Human trials of a novel vaccine against the potentially deadly Rift Valley fever virus (RVF) are to take place in Tanzania 'Äî a country where the mosquito-borne disease poses a significant threat to the lives and livelihoods of people in rural communities. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) will provide funding of up to US$28.5 million, with support from the European Union's Horizon Europe programme, to fund a research team led by the One Health Institute in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University of California, Davis (UC Davis) to conduct Phase I and Phase II trials of a novel RVF vaccine candidate.    The studies will be amongst the first CEPI-funded trials to be conducted in a region where RVF is endemic, and will assess the safety and immunogenicity of UC Davis' live-attenuated RVF vaccine, known as DDVax, in people most at risk of RVF infection. The Phase I trial is planned to begin in 2024, subject to regulatory and ethical approvals. DDvax is currently being evaluated in preclinical studies funded by CEPI and the EU under a previous agreement with Colorado State University, UC Davis and partners.    In addition to clinical trials in Tanzania, CEPI will fund technology transfer of assays and samples to laboratories in Tanzania, and regulatory engagement to plan a pathway to licensure for the vaccine. The consortium will also carry out comprehensive One Health-oriented epidemiological studies designed to generate valuable scientific knowledge about the sources and drivers of RVF outbreaks, thereby contributing to outbreak prediction and management and guiding late-stage vaccine development planning.  Rift Valley fever: a climate-driven disease with epidemic potential  RVF is a potentially deadly virus which can spread to people either through mosquito bites or through contact with infected livestock. The disease can cause severe symptoms such as encephalitis and hemorrhaging, and kills around 1 percent of all those it infects. RVF is also profoundly destructive for the livelihoods of those in rural areas where outbreaks occur and often results in large-scale losses of livestock.    Because of its impact on both people and animals, RVF is a prime candidate for a 'ÄòOne Health' approach to disease control. No safe and effective human vaccines or treatments have yet been approved for use against RVF, so their development is considered a top priority by both the Africa CDC and the World Health Organization's R&D Blueprint team.    RVF was first identified in Kenya's Rift Valley, but in recent decades has steadily extended its reach across much of Africa and parts of the Middle East, putting more people in more countries at risk of infection. Outbreaks of RVF have been consistently linked with intense periods of rainfall and flooding - including those caused by the El Ni√±o phenomenon which has recently returned after a seven year absence. Heavy rains provide ideal conditions for RVF-infected mosquitoes to breed and hatch. As climate change persists, expanding the range of mosquitoes and increasing the likelihood of extreme weather events such as flooding, there is a risk that RVF outbreaks will become more frequent and widespread making the development of a protective human vaccine all the more urgent.    Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said: ""Despite the devastating impact that Rift Valley fever can inflict on the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable communities, no licensed vaccines are available to prevent the disease. Climate change is making weather patterns ever more volatile, increasing the risk of more frequent and widespread outbreaks of this potentially deadly virus, and making the development of safe and effective vaccines more urgent than ever before. Through this partnership, CEPI and EU funding will support UC Davis and its partners to advance this promising vaccine candidate into clinical trials in an endemic country, generating crucial data in the population most likely to benefit from its protection in the future.""    Marc Lema√Ætre, Director-General for Research and Innovation, European Commission, said: ""With the memories of the recent pandemic still fresh in our minds, we know how important it is to invest in research to prevent and control the threat from infectious diseases. An effective vaccine against Rift Valley Fever would go a long way to prevent more frequent and deadly outbreaks, with all the serious public health and socioeconomic consequences that we see today. I am pleased to see that this essential research project can now take off with the steadfast support of the European Union and Horizon Europe, through our great collaboration with CEPI. The EU and its Member States have been among the largest contributors to CEPI since its inception. From the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation, we have provided more than EUR 240 million since 2017 and we are proud of the great scientific progress the strong partnership with CEPI has produced on Ebola, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and COVID-19 so far. I am confident that the project starting today will bring us even closer to an effective vaccine against Rift Valley Fever.""    Dr Brian Bird, Project Director, UC Davis One Health Institute, said: ""A One Health approach to vaccination and community-based risk reduction activities is essential to control Rift Valley fever. We are tremendously excited to work with CEPI and our partners to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of DDVax in clinical trials in Tanzania, and to understand the underlying epidemiology of this deadly zoonotic disease. Working together as a multi-disciplinary team we can improve the lives of people, animals, and communities across the world.""    Dr Ally Olotu, Head, Department of Interventions & Clinical Trials, Ifakara Health Institute, said: ""Rift Valley fever virus has periodically caused severe outbreaks in Tanzania and across Africa, impacting people's health, their livestock, and socio-economic outcomes. An effective vaccine for humans would be a game changer for public health. The Ifakara Health Institute is delighted to partner with UC Davis and CEPI to evaluate the DDVax candidate, and work to understand the dynamics of RVF transmission to inform vaccine deployment in the future.""    This funding is being awarded under a CEPI Call for Proposals designed to support RVF vaccine candidates through clinical trials in endemic areas, which is supported by EUR35m provided by the European Union's Horizon Europe programme.   Enabling equitable access to RVF vaccines  RVF primarily impacts rural and pastoral communities living in low- and middle-income countries in East Africa. CEPI and the UC Davis-led consortium are committed to enabling equitable access to RVF vaccines to the populations who need them, in line with CEPI's Equitable Access Policy. This includes planning for the potential development of investigational stockpiles for use in outbreak situations, agreeing to an affordable pricing mechanism such as Cost of Goods +%, and endeavouring to manufacture the vaccines at geographically dispersed manufacturing sites close to where outbreaks may occur in order to minimise supply risks. In addition, the clinical trial and epidemiological data generated by this projects will be published open access to benefit the broader public health and research communities.

C07305,Children and young people living in poverty: COVID-19 needs and policy implications,"This project addresses the UK's serious knowledge gap in understanding the needs of children and young people (CYP) aged 5-18 living in poverty in the context of Covid19. A North East(NE) regional analysis is required urgently to inform policy decisions being taken quickly without real understanding of lived experiences of poverty. This project will enable policy to consider how best to address children's social, emotional, physical and educational needs.  This project that puts CYP's voice at its centre is co-designed and co-delivered by researchers from Newcastle University's Centre for Learning and Teaching and the charity Children North East (CNE). The long-standing reputation CNE has built upon by providing support during lockdown will ensure high engagement by families in the research, and an extensive reach through networks will enable policymakers to make timely use of findings.  CYP will be invited to communicate experiences and needs in a format of their choice (writing, picture, photo) and we anticipate a sample of 1500. 500 CYP will be consulted in more depth (face to face/online interviews/focus groups). Twenty interviews with  organisations working with CYP will triangulate findings. We will investigate and compare organisational response to CYP living in poverty. Case studies of practice and policy change will be shared nationally as good practice examples. Our regional and national networks will ensure quick and effective dissemination of findings. Outputs from the project include two academic articles, three research reports, two linked policy workshops/webinars, a policy brief, a series of short comics, and an animated video.",10,10b
P23530,Redefining mass spectrometry 'Äì a breakthrough platform for real-time noninvasive breath analysis with single ion detection of intact viruses and bacteria and post-analysis molecular characterization,"The extraordinary ability of the coronavirus to spread in the environment has established the Covid-19 pandemic as the biggest challenge humanity faces in the XXI century. Covid-19 attacks humans regardless of age, claiming the life of over 8,000 people in a single day, with a devastating death toll exceeding 350,000 in just a few months. The virus is likely to survive for the foreseeable future and disperse further, requiring long-term planning and investment in developing means of detection, protection and cure. Protective measures based on monitoring the dispersion of the coronavirus in the environment and fast screening of individuals has become paramount for ensuring safety of our ageing population and restarting/supporting the worldwide economy. The objective of the ARIADNE project is to develop a multiple-stage analytical platform based on multi-dimensional mass spectrometry instrumentation. Performing direct and instant detection of intact virus particles in breath and in water, and going far beyond that task, this unique analytical platform will push the scientific boundaries in all aspects of analytical sciences centered on mass spectrometry, incorporating a series of potentially disruptive technologies integrated into a single system. ARIADNE integrates state-of-the-art technological advancements in breath sampling and post-ionization methods, new analytical tools for characterization of the protein content of viruses by top-down mass spectrometry, non-destructive ultra-high mass analysis of single particles followed by their soft landing and further processing based on advanced single proteomic workflows. A compact and simplified version of this versatile and powerful analytical platform is also envisaged for advancing the field of real-time breath analytics. Applications extending the analytical capabilities of the system to new viruses, intact bacteria as well as whole human cells will also become accessible.",1,1a
C14367,CoV-Ind-UK: Prospective investigation of the determinants for COVID-19 outcomes amongst South Asians in India and the United Kingdom.,"South Asian people are at high risk both for infection with SARS-CoV2 virus, and for developing severe or fatal COVID-19. Addressing this inequality is a major public health priority. In this study, we will identify incident COVID-19, amongst ~30,000 South Asian men and women who are participants of our established prospective population studies in India and the UK. Participants will undergo testing for SARS-CoV2, and complete a validated questionnaire to assess symptoms, relevant behaviours, attitudes to vaccination, and adverse outcomes. We will use our available comprehensive baseline phenotypic data, including molecular characterisation and stored biological samples, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, to determine what are the major risk factors for infection with SARS-CoV2, severe COVID-19, or prolonged COVID-19, amongst South Asians in India and the UK. We will focus initially on recognised risk factors such as adiposity, raised blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, health behaviours, socio-economic indicators, and biochemical measures. We will compare our results in South Asians with equivalent data for Europeans, to determine whether these known risk factors explain the high risk of COVID-19 in Asians. We will develop simple tools for predicting risk of COVID-19 in South Asians, that can prioritise people for vaccination or behavioural interventions, and thus protect them from COVID-19. We will report on vaccine hesitancy in South Asians and the main reasons for this. Finally, we will use 'all-of-the-data', including available health and genetic data, to search for novel risk factors or biological processes that might contribute to COVID-19 in South Asians. Our research will thereby determine the reasons underlying the high burden of COVID-19 in South Asians and generate knowledge that will inform health policy and practice for prevention and control of the disease amongst South Asians in India, the UK and globally.","4, 9","4a, 4b, 4c, 9d"

The results of recent studies show that, while the vaccines have shown very good short-term efficacy, the protection of the elders may be insufficient, 6 months after the 2nd dose. Some countries have started to offer a 3rd dose. We plan to act at the level of the intestinal flora of the elderly (which is often unbalanced) in order to increase the effectiveness of vaccination. Indeed, it has been shown that probiotics (which can rebalance the intestinal flora) significantly increase the production of antibodies after vaccination against the flu virus. Our hypothesis is that taking probiotics one month before and one month after the 3rd dose of COVID vaccine would provide longer-lasting vaccine protection in the elderly. Our study will include 668 seniors, aged 65 to 89, who have not had COVID-19, who have received 2 doses of the same vaccine and who will accept a 3rd dose of vaccine. All participants will take one capsule/day (probiotics or placebo) for 2 months and, in the middle of this period, they will receive a 3rd dose of vaccine. Participants will have to travel 3 times to the Sherbrooke Clinical Research Center (inclusion visit, vaccination and final visit). On five occasions (inclusion, vaccination 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-vaccination), they will prick their fingertips and express the drop of blood on blotting paper. They will mail this dry blood sample in an envelope for the antibodies to be dosed in Quebec. We expect to reduce by 1/3 the number of seniors poorly protected by the 3rd dose of vaccine 6 months after the injection thanks to probiotics. If successful, this approach could quickly be implemented worldwide because probiotics have few side effects and are affordable.]","1, 4","1d, 4c"
C07168,Role of host genetics in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity of infection,"Novel Coronavirus 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is a global pandemic disease that has severely affected the United States. Emerging data suggests that racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and African Americans (AA) are overrepresented among hospitalized patients. The clinical symptoms vary from mild in approximately 80% of cases to critically ill. Established risk factors are age, gender and several comorbidities including cancer. Many other factors in clinical severity remain unexplained. This proposal will leverage remnant biospecimens from laboratory-proven COVID-19 positive individuals at Quest Diagnostics, a national commercial laboratory that has performed over 3.75 million COVID-19 tests and has identified over 298,000 positive cases to date, to study host-genetics of COVID19. We expect to include >7500 samples with whole genome genotyping, performed in collaboration with intramural NCI. While there are no established predictors of severity, certain biomarkers from total blood count have been observed to correlate with worse outcomes. Several studies have reported the role of uncontrolled cytokine release to be correlated with poor outcome. We will incorporate biomarkers such as lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and other inflammation markers to develop a severity score. Using this severity score, we will classify individuals as having mild, severe or critical infection. Biospecimens with de-identified clinical data from Quest and vital status data from the National Death Index in the 28 days period from testing positive, will be utilized to determine whether host genetic factors modify COVID-19 outcomes. We will discover novel genetic variation and clonal hematopoiesis (CH) associated with infection severity, mortality and cytokine storm. Finally, we will compare these novel genetic biomarkers in a cancer cohort of 2,000 individuals from MSKCC to contrast COVID-19 specific outcomes in cancer care. This study represents one of the largest COVID-19 cohorts for genetic association studies. These data will be used to compare genetic diversity and the role it plays in COVID-19 severity and will add to the understanding of constitutional determinants of host immune response to mild and severe viral infection and inflammation.","1, 3, 4","1d, 3b, 4a"
C07079,Effects of COVID-19 in Patients with Gastroparesis: A GpCRC Supplement,"ABSTRACT:Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly presents with symptoms including fever, cough, andshortness of breath. Some patients have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after developing gastrointestinal(GI) symptoms either solely or in conjunction with pulmonary symptoms. This may be due to SARS-CoV-2infection of the GI tract or a systemic effect from the respiratory viral infection. In patients with chronic GIillnesses, such as gastroparesis, COVID-19 may present as a flare of their underlying GI condition asviruses have historically been implicated in exacerbations of chronic GI disorders, including gastroparesis.Some patients with no underlying GI conditions have been diagnosed with COVID-19 after presentingpredominantly with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. They may be at risk for developing post-viralgastroparesis, which is an important and poorly understood potential chronic inflammation-based cause of""idiopathic gastroparesis"". The NIH Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC), consisting of sixclinical centers and its Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC), is following the largest number ofpatients with gastroparesis and dyspepsia symptoms. These patients are well phenotyped. In addition todetailed physiological phenotyping, every 6 months we obtain detailed questionnaires, and store plasmaand serum. The overall goals of this supplemental grant are to determine if COVID-19 affects clinicalcourse of patients with gastroparesis and whether COVID-19 is associated with development ofpost-infection gastroparesis and/or functional dyspepsia. We will accomplish these goals byundertaking the following three specific aims involving patients in our gastroparesis registry. Aim 1.Determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with confirmed gastroparesis to help assessif SARS-CoV-2 infection disproportionately affects patients with gastroparesis compared to generalcommunity population in same geographic location. Aim 2: Determine if COVID-19 affects the clinicalcourse of patients with gastroparesis by causing more flares than usual, increasing the severity ofgastroparesis symptoms, and decreasing gastric emptying. Aim 3: Characterize patients developing newonset gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia after COVID-19 in patients. Currently, the GpCRC is the onlylarge, NIH-funded registry of patients with chronic GI symptoms from gastric dysmotility (gastroparesis). TheGI epithelial involvement with SARS-CoV-2 as well as the existing rationale that such infections can led tochronic gut dysfunction, makes GpCRC ideally poised to conduct this research. This research project will beaccomplished within 1 year timeline to produce impactful clinical data to understand GI implications ofSARS-CoV-2 infection. This proposed study will be implemented at all six clinical sites of the GpCRC withSDRC for coordination and Mayo Clinic core of the GpCRC will be used for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing.",4,"4b, 4c"
C06810,Genetic underpinnings of dysosmia in COVID-19,"Abstract entitled ""Genetic underpinnings of dysosmia in COVID-19"": There is evidence that smell and tastedysfunction is an early and often the only identifier in COVI-19 positive patients. We hypothesize that geneticvariants in specific candidate genes associated with the development of unique sensory phenotypes of COVID-19patients: In patients reported to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery using the COVID-19Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians, in the first 237 entries anosmia was noted in 73% of patients prior to COVID-19diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6%. The occurrence in asymptomatic individuals makes this finding a usefultarget for public health screening and would facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as the identification of thoseindividuals who are not ill but still capable of spreading the disease. The mechanism underlying sensory alteration iscurrently unknown. Infectious diseases may demonstrate a heritable component - that is the propensity to contract anddevelop active infection and the severity of the immune response is influenced by host genetic factors to some extent andmay reflect inter-individual variation in the host immune response. The genetic basis of this variability in response willprovide important clues for therapeutics and lead to identification of groups at high risk of death. Public health measuresto identify those at increased genetic risk of severe infection would be useful as a way of mitigating the economic effectsof lockdown and social distancing policies. The genetic influence on COVID-19 symptoms may reflect genotype status ofcandidate genes such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Our team has been on the forefront to collect preliminary data on thepresence of neurosensory disturbances in COVID-19 patients. We and others reported that anosmia is an importantpredictive symptom of COVID-19. Moreover, a UK twin study has shown that anosmia in COVID-19 patients has a highheritability (h2 = 0.48), suggesting that an individual's genotype plays a role in the presence or absence of this symptom.The goal of this study is to determine the susceptibility which may be influenced by host genotype to sensory disorders inCOVID-19 patients to estimate the heritability of covid-19 sensory symptoms. In this study we will expand our work onfollowing Specific Aim: Identify genetic variation associated with the development of dysosmia in COVID-19patients. We hypothesize that there are genetic variants in the candidate genes that underlie smell and taste dysfunction inboth symptomatic and otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data: We have established aninternational interdisciplinary collaboration team and have collected and published preliminary data on the role of ENT inCOVID-19 and on the prevalence of sensory dysfunction in COVID-19 in our pilot studies. To determine if variants inspecific candidate genes are associated with the development of anosmia in COVID-19 patients, we will collect DNAsamples in our local COVID-19 patients and international patients from our collaborators for the study. In our hospitals,we have access to over 462 patients with confirmed positive COVID-19, 1565 with confirmed negative, and 390 patientswith pending testing results. Over 10% of these patients report smell and taste dysfunction; our international collaboratorshave a large cohort of COVID-19 patients with smell and taste dysfunction available to us as well (see their LOS). We willperform WES on 120 samples from COVID-19 patients including 60 with smell and taste dysfunction and 60 without. Wehave established a COVID19 blood sample treatment process at our pathology lab for our ongoing study. Whole exomesequencing will be performed using established methods in the Center for Genome Technology in the Hussman Institutefor Human Genomics (HIHG). Innovations in our proposal include: 1. Identify genetic markers for the early detectionof mild and asymptotic COVID-19. 2.

We are testing the hypothesis that MBCTengages a novel therapeutic mechanism involving increased capacity for metacognitive emotion regulation(""decentering""), and this is underlain by increased functional connectivity (FC) between the posterior cingulatecortex (PCC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We hypothesized that MBCT-linked increases indecentering would reduce perservative negative thinking (PNT), a transdiagnostic process common to distressdisorders. However, at present our entire planet is caught in the grip of a global COVID-19 pandemic, which hasled to suspension of in-person research. Nearly half of US adults report negative mental health impact due toworry and stress over the virus, and disease and social burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as stressfrom the resulting economic downturn are profoundly impacting mental health. The state of Michigan (>52KCOVID-19 cases/>5K deaths) is among the most impacted ""hot zones"" in the US. Communities with highdensities of low-income African Americans are the hardest hit and disproportionately bear the brunt of thispandemic. African Americans account for 32% of all Michigan COVID cases and 44% of all COVID-relateddeaths, yet are only 14% of the Michigan population. Wayne County, which includes the city of Detroit, is thesingle hardest hit location in Michigan, with >19K cases and >2K deaths. African Americans are also oftenexposed to everyday racial discrimination, a prevalent and pernicious form of psychological stress, and havehigher rates of physical health disorders that amplify COVID risk. Childhood adversity, trauma exposures, andpoverty, disproportionately elevated in African Americans, as well as PNT, likely also substantially increase riskfor anxiety, depression, and SUD in the context of COVID-related stress. Mental health treatments are neededfor COVID-impacted individuals, especially low income African Americans who are disproportionately impacted;however, social distancing measures and increased financial insecurity create additional barriers. To adequatelyserve these communities we now face an urgent need to test the feasibility and efficacy of already validated,remotely-delivered stress management programs in health disparity populations. Such remotely deliveredinterventions, including MBCT, are feasible and recent data suggest are highly efficient and efficacious fordepression, anxiety, PTSD and SUD. Based on this evidence, we propose to conduct a RCT of remotelydelivered MBCT (N=30) & PMR (N=30) in underserved, trauma-exposed health disparity populationsdisproportionately impacted by COVID in South East Michigan. We will test hypotheses about the efficacy ofremotely-delivered stress management for COVID-related stress, anxiety and depression in this population, aswell as hypotheses about the specific psychological mechanism of MBCT, involving increased decentering /metacognitive emotional regulation, and how this relates to improvement in PNT and related distress.","9, 10","9a, 10a"

C19519,Restriction of HIV and coronavirus infections by the innate immunity protein Shiftless,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a mechanism of recoding that allows synthesis of multiple proteins from the same mRNA by shifting the translation reading frame. Many viruses, including medically important HIV and coronaviruses rely on PRF to increase their coding capacity and modulate appropriate stoichiometric ratios of viral proteins. An interferon-inducible restriction factor Shiftless (SFL) can block the frameshifting required for viral translation and infectivity. Understanding the mechanism of action of SFL will undoubtedly guide the design of new antiviral therapeutics. However, most structural and functional aspects of SFL and its role in viral infections are unknown. We intend to characterise the role of SFL in HIV and coronavirus infections using a three-pronged approach: (i) We will elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of PRF on viral mRNAs by SFL using a state-of-the-art in vitro reconstituted translation system and depletion/deletion of SFL in human cell lines. (ii) We will determine the interaction of SFL, translating ribosome and frameshifting viral mRNAs using cryo-electron microscopy. (iii) Based on the structural data obtained, we will generate mutants of SFL and characterise their activities by in vitro and cellular translation assays to identify specific domains and amino acid residues required for the antiviral activity of SFL. The results expected from our proposed study should not only be crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism of SFL but should also provide vital inputs to the development of antiviral therapeutic agents by either mimicking or upregulating SFL expression against critically important viruses such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, our research should continue to be relevant for the treatment of any future frameshifting virus.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

Chinese students comprise the UK's largest proportion of international students and are important to HEI's financial sustainability. The project will use principles from research in intercultural communication, health communication and media literacies to examine how Chinese students access and evaluate information, negotiate intercultural differences, and cope with COVID-19-related stigma, and how these processes affect their attitudes towards studying in the UK. It will adopt a participatory-research model, engaging participants in data collection/analysis, empowering them to communicate their findings to relevant parties and build resilience. The results will improve universities' ability to support international students and more broadly enhance our understanding of the problems faced by people residing in different cultures during pandemics. The unique participatory approach developed will be applicable to studying and supporting other multicultural/multilingual communities in the UK.",9,9c
P24986,COVID-Protect - Efficacy of Nrf2 activators for the prevention of cell damage in COVID-19 - Subproject screening of Nrf2 activators.,"COVID-19 poses a great challenge for humanity and the health system whose functionality is of great importance. Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, protective measures are essential. Healthcare workers are at forefront of exposure to infected and undiagnosed COVID-19 cases. Regardless of the pandemic, patients, especially the chronic ill, need medical advice. In this case, protection of employees in health care system is linked to specific requirements to avoid contagion and staff downtime and to ensure the functionality of the basic health care system. Recommendations for personal protective equipment can vary between public health authorities, which can contribute to uncertainty among healthcare workers. Knowledge is limited and reports of experiences are essential.There is a lack of direct information on experience, attitudes and the infection prevention of healthcare workers. Elicitations of health system worker´s experience, attitudes and personal protection of the use of masks, hygiene measures and vaccinations are required. The aim of this study is to determine the protection situation of general practitioners and employees of nursing homes. The knowledge and the experiences of practitioner´s protection help to uncover strengths and weaknesses and for guiding evidence-based protective measures in healthcare settings.     Method: This mixed-method study will examine the protection situation of general practitioners and employees of nursing homes by executing semi-structured interviews and a survey.","5, 9","5c, 9a"
C10643,"Population-based virtual mental health interventions for children, youth and families during COVID-19: If we build it, will they come?","BACKGROUND: Public health emergency measures (EMs) to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have led to losses of structured school time, extracurricular activities, and social activities, impacting all aspects of children's lives. Virtual mental health care (MH) has since become ensconced in our health care system. Despite the anticipated impact on MH and MH care, data examining these outcomes are scarce. Four leading research teams have joined forces to improve our understanding of the MH of Canadian children, youth, and parents and the acceptability of virtual MH interventions during the pandemic within these well characterized clinical and population-based cohorts.   GOALS:  To determine the impact of COVID-19 related EM on child and parental MH and family functioning in real-time over 12 months. Further, to determine the feasibility of providing MH profile- and developmental age- specific virtual MH interventions to these children and families, identify risk and protective factors, and compare the MH trajectories of vulnerable and otherwise healthy youth throughout the pandemic and into the recovery period.  METHODS: 6,200 children ages 0 to 18 years and their families will be recruited for participation. Validated measures will be administered monthly. Feasibility of virtual MH treatment will be determined by measures of recruitment, enrolment, and retention rates for referred interventions.  IMPACT: The results of this study will provide the information needed to direct MH care, including virtual care, planning and inform public health discussions regarding the EM reduction process during the pandemic recovery phase and their reimplementation (if necessary) during subsequent COVID-19 pandemic waves.",10,"10a, 10b"
C00897,Spatiotemporal Mechanisms of Olfactory Processing in the Human Brain,"(Administrative Supplement)COVID-19 is a viral disease (SARS-CoV-2) that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization onMarch 11, 2020. The disease has negatively impacted the health of millions of people around the world and istaking a toll on the global economy. The disease has been particularly difficult to contain as it is highlycontagious, has a long incubation time (2-14 days) and many carriers of the virus are asymptomatic [1-2].Initial reports of the disease showed that the symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, body aches andshortness of breath [3-4]. However, more recent reports have shown that many COVID-19 patients also losetheir ability to smell [5]. Furthermore, reports show that the patients who experience smell loss may otherwisebe asymptomatic suggesting that smell loss could potentially be an early indicator of COVID-19 in a subset ofthe population [5]. These recent findings highlight the importance of studying the relationship between smellloss and COVID-19 to better understand the mechanisms and symptoms of the disorder as well as its potentiallong term effects. The study proposed here will investigate: 1) the extent to which COVID-19 patients developsmell loss (anosmia); and 2) whether the early presence of anosmia can be used to predict the severity ofdisease. To invesitgate this urgent question, we will use the well-established 8-item ""Brief"" University ofPennsylvania Smell Identification Test (""B-SIT"") [6-9] to assess the olfactory abilities in patients with suspectedCOVID-19 infection who present to the COVID-19 external testing sites affiliated with the University ofPennsylvania.",4,4b
P23112,Developing a Culture of Biomedical Research at the University of the Virgin Islands,"PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal will enhance and innovate the biomedical research infrastructure and training at the University of  the Virgin Islands (UVI), the only higher educational institution in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). The overall objective  of this proposal is to provide the highest level of sponsored program services for biomedical research by  developing a culture of research through training, mentoring, collaboration and a strong infrastructure. UVIÃ¢Â€Â™s  vision is to develop research resulting in an increase in the number of faculty conducting excellent externally  funded biomedical research who will be able to mentor undergraduate students with potential for careers in  science. There are several motivating factors for this project: (1) Diversity in the scientific workforce is key to the  future biomedical discoveries that will improve the health of the Nation, and HBCUs such as UVI have an  important role to play in training students who are underrepresented in science. (2) The USVI is a medically  underserved area that experiences dramatic health disparities and emerging diseases including dengue,  chikungunya, Zika, and the more recent coronavirus, which are important not only in the Caribbean but are also  increasing on the US mainland. Little research on population health has been performed in the USVI and UVI  continues to look at research in these areas. (3) Extensive undergraduate research experience is essential to  prepare students for highly competitive doctoral programs. Although UVI has very successful programs that  mentor undergraduates in research, there are many more UVI students interested in research experience than  can be accommodated in externally funded research laboratories. (4) UVI has established a culture of innovation in  its 2018-2023 Strategic Plan and through this research infrastructure and innovation is a primary focus area and is  supported by the President and senior leadership. The UVI Institutional Development Plan (IDP) addresses barriers  to research and informs the Specific Aims of this proposal: (1) Develop UVIÃ¢Â€Â™s research administration leadership  and organization such that it is well-trained, resourced, and motivated to support a culture of research. (2)  Develop research review and training programs for research faculty to increase the number and improve the  competitiveness of proposal submissions (3) Increase mentorship and training opportunities for undergraduates in  biomedical research by supporting faculty to receive external funding. This program is innovative because it will  fully integrate the IDP for research within UVIÃ¢Â€Â™s 2018-2023 Strategic Plan, providing strong institution-wide  commitment. Research and training innovations include targeted training initiatives covering the life cycle of  research, increased outreach efforts, training and grant writing initiatives and focus groups of HBCU research  administrators to overcome the barrier of geographic isolation. UVIÃ¢Â€Â™s logic model will be used to ensure that  each activity will contribute to a sustainable vision for research and to developing a University-wide culture  supporting research.",12,"12a, 12b"
C03903,Social Media Intervention to Promote Smoking Treatment Utilization and Cessation among Alaska Native Smokers,"PROJECT SUMMARYThis application is for an administrative supplement (PA-18-591) to NIDA-funded R34 grant ""Social MediaIntervention to Promote Smoking Treatment Utilization and Cessation among Alaska Native Smokers"" (R34DA46008). It is responsive to the NIDA notice of special Interest, NOT-DA-20-047 and meets the statedobjective to understand the broad impacts of COVID-19 (e.g., anxiety, social isolation) on access to addictiontreatment and substance use. The parent R34 grant is a Stage I treatment development grant to develop andpilot test a Facebook (FB) intervention for AN smokers statewide. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic,now more than ever, virtual options, such as social media, hold promise as sustainable and scalableintervention strategies to promote access to smoking cessation treatment among Alaska Native (AN) people,and other vulnerable and underserved health disparity groups who experience a disproportionate burden oftobacco-related morbidity/mortality and who may also be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In thissupplement, we propose to adapt and evaluate perceived effectiveness of new content for the FB interventionrelevant to COVID-19 and smoking, using a rigorous participatory approach, as was done in developing othercontent. We will also collect data on self-reported impacts of COVID-19 on our outcomes of treatmentutilization and cessation within our ongoing pilot clinical trial. Our Specific Aims (within the scope, timeline, andcurrent evaluation process of the current R34) are to: 1) Assess the perceived effectiveness of social mediacontent and communication on COVID-19 and smoking (N=40). We will use existing content on COVID-19(e.g., CDC Tips™ campaign videos) for adaptation. Potential content adaptations for COVID-19 messagingthat may impact treatment utilization and quitting as barriers or facilitators include stress, anxiety, perceivedrisks, social isolation, and social support; and 2) Explore the self-reported impact of COVID-19 perceived risks,severity, and COVID-related anxiety, stress, financial impacts, social isolation, and social support, on ourprimary outcome of smoking treatment utilization and cessation in our ongoing R34 pilot clinical trial (N=60) at6-months follow-up. Our measures have been pilot tested and were selected from a bank of COVID-19measures provided by the NIH. Expanding FB intervention content to address COVID-19 and evaluatingCOVID-19 impacts, within the parent R34 grant, is timely and significant. This work will provide the foundationfor a larger Stage II efficacy trial.","9, 10","9a, 9c, 10a, 10b, 10c"
C10005,MICA: Community Based Point-of-Need Integrated Diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2,"Currently, validated diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infections include laboratory-based tests involving Reverse Transcriptase (RT) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or RT-isothermal Loop-Mediated Amplification (RT-LAMP), using swabs from the upper respiratory tract, as well as blood-based IgM/IgG/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) lateral flow immunodiagnostic devices (LFD) are also available for community testing. Most recently DNA testing ex-laboratories has been achieved, albeit with complex and expensive units (e.g. DNAnudge). In general, although these commercial products provide solutions for testing in many scenarios, there remains a need for low-cost, point-of-need nucleic acid sensors, able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in a timely manner, providing multiplexed tests (e.g. with RSV, influenza), without the need for expensive equipment.    We have developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assay, targeting sequences in the ORF1 ab region and N gene simultaneously (as recommended by China CDC and USA FDA). The assay has been optimised, now giving a limit of detection <64 copies/ml and validated clinically against 7 other respiratory viruses, showing no cross reactivity. We propose to incorporate this into a multiplexed community-use, hand-held nucleic acid-based sensor as a self-contained single-use disposable device. A nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample will be placed into an injection-molded cartridge, containing all reagents to perform sample enrichment and RT-LAMP. The multiplexed result is read visually on an integrated paper-LFD. The device enables (i) sample enrichment, reducing the elution volume from a swab and (ii) simple methods for thermal management, and will be validated in a statistically-powered study, to ensure the test's rapid translation to our clinical and industrial partners.",1,1a

So far (04/13/2020) there are already at least 22300 people infected and 1230 deaths in the country. Worldwide, the number of deaths exceeds 116,000. The virus is advancing rapidly around the world, and everyone who can is looking for alternatives to contain it, so far we have no medicine, vaccine or other method of control other than social detachment. In order to contribute to this search for scientific knowledge for the development of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, the molecular mechanisms that promote and sustain viral infection must be defined. An important therapeutic target among coronaviruses is the main protease Mpro (or 3CLpro), due to its essential role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from viral RNA and enabling the formation of the viral particle. Thus, the purpose of this work is to identify specific inhibitors for the main Mpro protease of SARS-CoV-2 using the phage display technique using peptide libraries and protein inhibitors.

C20527,Youth exposure to marketing of sugary beverages and intake across six countries during pre- mid- and late COVID-19 pandemic,"Unhealthy food marketing is omnipresent and influences youths food preferences, consumption patterns and purchases, with important implications for health later in life. Marketing of sugary drinks is of particular interest as these are a principal source of sugar in young Canadians diets and intake is associated with obesity. Globally, public health policies have been implemented to restrict marketing directed at youth. In parallel, exposure to marketing of sugary drinks may have increased as a result of greater screen time during COVID-19 lockdowns and preliminary evidence suggests sugary drink intakes increased among youth. This project will explore youth exposure to marketing of sugary drinks across 6 countries and the relationship between marketing exposure and sugary drink intake during 3 phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (pre, mid, late). Exposure to marketing in various locations and intake of sugary drinks will be measured in repeated surveys of 11,500 youth ages 10-17 from Canada, Australia, Chile, Mexico, United Kingdom and United States at each phase of the pandemic as part of the International Food Policy Study. The level of lockdown restrictions will be assessed at each time point in each country to investigate associations with marketing exposure and sugary drink intake. Differences in potentially vulnerable subpopulations will be explored. This research uniquely provides in-depth individual-level marketing exposure data at various time points of the pandemic. Findings will contribute to global knowledge on the impact of food marketing on health-related outcomes among youth to inform food marketing policy, and may also inform future health crises, ensuring public health measures are supported by efforts to protect vulnerable populations. ",10,10a
C14342,Low cost air quality device for virus removal from indoor air environment and public transport (EP/V049100/1),"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets which linger in enclosed spaces, often exacerbated by HVAC systems. Although research to improve HVAC handling of SARS-CoV-2 is progressing, currently installed HVAC systems cause problems because they recirculate air and also use ineffective virus filters. This project will develop a novel method of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and future viruses in enclosed spaces using Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) technology, previously employed to remove organic contaminants and compounds from air streams using the irradiation of titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces with ultraviolet (UV) lights causing the disintegration of organic compounds by reactions with oxygen (O) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). The O and OH reactions can also destroy viruses.    Using the established results from previous R&D, the project will develop a novel TiO2 coated copper fibre mop system, which will both act as a fan and provide the essential very large surface area for UV irradiation. Research will include optimizing UV frequencies, intensity, and improvement on photocatalytic oxidation by doping of TiO2 with metals, followed by in vitro studies investigating the effects on SARS-CoV-2, and other endemic coronaviruses. The rotating fibre fan, illuminated by a high intensity UV, allows viruses to be eliminated in an efficient, nearly silent system, adaptable for small or larger applications.    Engineering will include optimization of two demonstrators: a low-profile wall unit and free- standing floor unit. These low cost, efficient systems will be demonstrated to industry to allow rapid adoption for buildings and public transport systems.",5,5b
C09639,Informational and structural barriers to uptake of preventive behaviours among Healthcare workers working in both isolation and non-isolation sitesduring COVID 19 in Zambia,"1)	Project background, context and needs addressed  Countries all over the world areimplementing different strategies to prepare for expected increase in numbers of patients who test positive for COVID-19.The rising number of positive  COVID-19 cases puts healthcare workers(HCW) at increased risk of infection,posing a serious threat to the epidemic chain as healthcare workers are the frontliners helping in controlling the pandemic.(1) As the numbers of  positive patients increase,  the risk to Healthcare also increases, putting a strain on supply of Personal protective equipment (PPE) as shortages of PPE are being noted in most health facilities around the world.(2) Other factors that put healthcare workers at risk includedelayed recognition of COVID-19 symptoms and lack of experience in dealing with respiratory pathogens,exposure to large numbers of patients in long shifts with inadequate rest periodsand lack of measures to prevent the spread in hospitals.(3)Thus, the World Health Organisation WHO recommends training and support for HCWs including to recognize respiratory diseases occurring in hospital settings even as it attempts to ensure consistent supply and distrubition of PPE(3,7).  Countries have systematically implemented various infection preventionand control measureswith good results - for example, using refined management theory,a general hospital in China ensured zero hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections among hospital staff.They formulated prevention and control measures and standards for non-isolation areas in the hospital,infrared temperature screenin was performed on all entering the hospital those with high fever were escorted to fever outpatient. They also ensured that rapid hand sanitizer stations  were at  all entrances. All outpatients were scheduled, to control patient flow and surfaced were wiped every 4 hours. For inpatient education material was placed in strategic areas with emphasis on hand hygiene, wearing masks correctly and reducing the number of visitors. Systematic training was also used to continuously give staff on the latest COVID-19 information(4) The Korean government ensured that HCWs received training in diagnostic testing for COVID-19, how to wear protective clothing, and in management of novel infectious diseases in screening clinics.(5) Singapore having learnt from the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome (SARS) has begun to prepare for new pandemics by  establishing a 330 bed facility and stockpiling PPE and barrier equipment. Other measures such as having strict staff management polices in place has also helped reduce infection. These include 14-day compulsory leave of absence for staff who traveled overseas, twice daily temperature screening for all clinical and nonclinical staff, separation of teams into those who care for COVID-19 patients and those who do not, and designated clean areas.(6)Staff with respiratory symptoms are also not allowed to come to work until symptoms completely resolve . In Italy, organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) helped separate wards that could be contaminated from wards less at risk and monitoring of patient and staff flow.They are also helping to increase knowledge of healthcare staff on how to protect themselves and better manage patients.(8)    Zambia reported its first two confirmed COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, 18 March 2020.9 Of the76 confirmed COVID-19 as of 24 April 2020,15 are HCWs, of whom at least 5 were working in isolation wards.10This raises questions about the training, systems, and PPE available and used by HCWs to prevent and controlCOVID-19 infection among HCWs in both non-isolation and isolation facilities. Establishing what HCWs know, their perceived threat of COVID-19 and their ability to practice preventive behavioursdissagregated by those directly working with and those not working with COVID-19 patients is important to design interventions that help control the spread of infection among HCWs including and not limited to training, system changes, practice and policy.      2)	Aims or research questions being addressed    This exploratory research aims to gather HCWs'perspectives on their knowledge and skills needs, their attitudes towards, and their ability to practice preventive behaviorsin the context of COVID-19 in Zambia.This perspectives will help inform interventions that reduce the  risk of COVID-19 transmission in health care settings.The research questions we hope to answer are as follows:    1.	What information do healthcare workers need to better protect themselves and their patients from the risk ofacquiringCOVID-19?  2.	How do HCWs feel handling patients who present with respiratory illness in the time of COVID-19?  3.	What are the motivators, facilitators and barriers to the uptake ofinfection prevention practices to avoid contracting COVID-19? How do these differ between HCWs in both isolation and non-isolation facilities?       3) Study design    This qualitative study will use in-depth interviews with 20 healthcare workers, 10 from the isolation centres and 10 from two health centres -- one in high and the other in low density hotspots in Lusaka, the epicenter for COVID-19 in Zambia.Ourstudy populations will includeMinistryOf Health Zambiastaff,in particular HCWsand support staff who are directly involved in triaging, screening, testing and caring for COVID-19 patients in isolation facilitesandnon-isolation sites.    If the current guidelines of social distancing are still in place by the time the study starts, we will conduct In-depth interviews by  phone, recruiting staff through the facility-in-charges and through the Zambia National Public Heath Institute (ZNPHI). The ZNPHI leads the national epidemic response. Staff will be contacted on phone numbersprovided by the in-charges and ZNPHI. The lead qualitative researcher (this applicant) will explain the study and emphasize voluntary participation, confidentiality and right to refuse/withdraw with no penalty. Those interested to proceed will be asked for verbal consent before the IDI. The IDIs will be conducted on a conference call to includea research assistant, who will document the conversation, engagement and emotion. The interview will be audio recordedwith participants' consent. Each interview is expected to take 1-1.5 hours and will be conducted in English.Which is predominantly spoken in Lusaka.Interviewswill then be transcribed verbatim.The computers used for data entry will be password-protected and have regularly updated anti-virus application. No personal identifiers will be noted; pseudonyms or codes will replace any identifying information arising during interviews.    Asemi-structured IDI guide will be used to collect the data andwillcontain open-ended but key questionstofullyexploreparticipantexperiencesthroughthe normal flow of conversation and probes to gain deeper insight and to pursue new information. Questions will explore the Once the interviews are completed, with the participant present on phone or in-person, interviewers will review the field guide and check the availability of notes and audio recordings to ensure that nothing has been left out.The recordings will then be transcribed verbatim. Final transcripts will be reviewed for accuracy against original notes and recordings for at least two transcripts. Recorded data will be transferred on to a lockable pass-word protected computer. Once this process is done and the quality of transcripts has been assured, recordings will be destroyed. All electronic data will be stored in secure locations, with access permissions only for authorized users.  At a minimum, data will be stored until the final analysis and reporting on the project are complete.

C10077,"Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes in COVID-19: A global registry of women with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infeciton in pregnancy and their neonates, understanding natural history to guide treatment and prevention","Summary:    To better understand some specific research questions as to how COVID-19 affects early pregnancy, fetal growth, prematurity and virus transmission to the baby the researchers will construct a registry of women with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 from early pregnancy to after delivery of the baby. Healthcare professionals from the UK and across many international centres will contribute data via a web portal.    Description:    The current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) is likely to affect hundreds of pregnant women globally. Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratoy Syndrome (SARS), also coronaviruses, caused more severe illness - particularly lung infections- in pregnant vs. non-pregnant women. There has been a report of nine women affected by COVID-19 in the latter third of their pregnancy, many more are likely to be affected. There is a data-gap on the effect of SARs-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 at other stages of pregnancy e.g. early pregnancy and its effect on the unborn and newborn baby. Maternity services and individual maternity centres are currently developing their responses using national and WHO guidance for non-pregnant women. PAN-COVID will develop a global database detailing a number of outcomes (death of the baby or mother, stillbirth, miscarriage, pregnancy complications, gestational age at delivery, delivery method and testing the baby for SARS-CoV-2). The aim of this database is to understand the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and the impact on mothers and their babies to guide both treatment and prevention.","3, 4","3a, 4b"
P22062,A Novel Strategy for Generating Safe and Effective Flavivirus Vaccines,"The recent emergence and devastating impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) clearly demonstrates that arboviral  emergence continues to defy accurate prediction and exposes our inability to rapidly respond to and control  outbreaks. The medical and veterinary importance of emerging flaviviruses is significantly exacerbated by the  absence of available vaccines, therapeutics, and reliable control measures. Vaccination remains the most  reliable strategy for outbreak prevention and control, but vaccine development intrinsically involves trade-offs  between safety and immunogenicity. This study will develop a platform to overcome these trade-offs by  combining the safety advantages of non-replicating platforms with the rapid and long-lived immunogenicity of a  live-attenuated vaccine. We have developed a unique chimeric virus platform based on a novel insect-specific  flavivirus (ISFV), Aripo virus (ARPV). Preliminary data shows ARPVÃ¢Â€Â™s host restriction is noticeably later in the  replication cycle than described for other ISFVs and is capable of entering vertebrate cells and developing a  robust immune response in the absence of genomic replication. An ARPV/ZIKV chimera was developed to test  our hypothesis that ARPV/ZIKV vaccination produces a rapid and robust innate, humoral, and cell-mediated  immune response that elicits sterilizing immunity against subsequent ZIKV challenge. Preliminary studies show  a single dose of ARPV/ZIKV produces a robust adaptive ZIKV-specific immune response that completely  protects mice from viremia, weight loss, and mortality, while demonstrating exceptional safety in vivo. This  platform is superior because of the increased safety of the chimera by virtue of its fundamental replication  defect in vertebrate cells, increased immunogenicity due to a lack of inactivation requirements, and efficient  genome delivery to target cells. This innovative and essential R01 aims to evaluate the safety profile,  protective efficacy and mechanisms underlying the immunogenicity of ARPV/ZIKV vaccination via three aims:   1. Determine the efficacy of ARPV/ZIKV immunization for preventing ZIKV-induced disease in murine and   rhesus macaque models.   2. Elucidate the correlates underlying vaccine-induced protection from ZIKV-induced disease in ARPV/ZIKV   vaccinated murine models.   3. Evaluate the safety profile of this vaccine candidate in vitro and in vivo, and elucidate the mechanism   underlying its immunogenicity.  This study will generate a safe, efficacious, single-dose ZIKV vaccine that will be ideally suited to affordably  control explosive outbreaks, which typically affect resource-limited regions. Our platformÃ¢Â€Â™s antigenic superiority  will result in enhanced efficacy, effectively combining the safety of replication-defective virus-like particles or  nucleic acid vaccines with the antigenic superiority, and rapid, long-lived immunogenicity of live-attenuated  vaccines. This platform can also be readily translated to other flaviviruses of human or veterinary importance.",7,7a
P22976,Dissecting ADP-ribosylation as an innate immune response countering influenza virus replication,"ABSTRACT  Viral infections manipulate diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs), altering existing protein landscapes  to create cellular environments favorable to replication. PTMs allow for rapid modulation of host environments  by altering protein abundance, localization, and activity. Because of their dynamic nature, PTMs typify ideal  immune response effectors or initiators. Our data identifies ADP-ribosylation, the modification of proteins with  ADP-ribose (ADPr), as a rapid, immune-like response from infected cells that constitutes an antiviral response  that counters influenza virus infection. Using cutting-edge ADPr-specific mass spectrometry approaches, we  have characterized with single amino acid resolution the ADP-ribosylome during influenza virus infection and  identified thousands of modifications on viral and host proteins. ADP-ribosylation has been associated with  antiviral responses against multiple viruses. However, little is known about how viral infections trigger this  response or the activiral mechanism(s) of ADP-ribosylation and poly(ADPr)-polymerases (PARPs), the enzymes  that catalyze addition of ADPr to proteins. Here, we propose studies of ADP-ribosylation during influenza virus  infection. We will identify the functional consequences of specific ADPr modifications, and building on our unique  ADP-ribosylome dataset, investigate how ADP-ribosylation alters the function of specific viral and host proteins.  We will interrogate the cellular pathways responsible for initiating ADP-ribosylation responses, defining the  molecular triggers and PARPs that are activated during influenza virus infection. These experiments will  elucidate the mechanisms of ADPr-mediated viral inhibition, the factors that trigger this response, and how  viruses counter it, establishing ADP-ribosylation as a key aspect of cellular antiviral responses and perhaps as  an entirely independent arm of antiviral defenses.",1,1b

P21946,Viral factors responsible for Lassa virus pathogenicity,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This career development award will help fill in the knowledge and skills in basic virological research of Risk  Group 4 agents, which need to be handled in the highest containment laboratory (BSL-4). This is essential for  the goal to become an independent researcher as an expert on highly pathogenic infectious diseases. The goal  during the award period is to reveal novel mechanisms of Lassa fever (LF) by using both in vivo and in vitro  techniques, leading to new insight into the development of countermeasures and controlling methods against  Lassa fever.  Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic in West African countries and causes outbreaks of LF annually. Although LASV  is one of the most alarming pathogens from a public health perspective, there are few effective vaccines or  therapeutics against LF. LASV must be handled at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4), due to its high pathogenicity. This  is one of the largest barriers to the development of preventive or therapeutic approaches against LF. Furthermore,  animal models of LF are limited, which is essential for basic research and development of countermeasures.  Recently, we developed a novel guinea pig model of LF and found that LASV strain LF2384 and LF2350 have  completely different pathogenic phenotypes in guinea pigs. These two viruses have been isolated from human  LF patients and pathogenicity of these viruses in guinea pigs is consistent with human cases. These unique  combinations of immunocompetent rodent model and clinical isolated LASVs are strong tools, which allow us to  reveal viral factors responsible for pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms underlying LASV pathogenicity. In  the proposed study, we will determine factors responsible for LASV pathogenicity and reveal novel molecular  mechanisms underlying LASV infection by using reverse genetics, in vivo experiments, and several in vitro  molecular techniques.  We will address this goal through three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will reveal the pathophysiology of  LASV infection in guinea pigs. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine viral factors responsible for LASV  pathogenicity by using reverse genetics and in vivo study. In Specific Aim 3, we will unveil molecular mechanisms  underlying LASV pathogenicity. Taken together, we hope to address novel pathogenic mechanisms of LASV  infection, leading to new insights to develop countermeasures against LF.",1,"1b, 1c, 1e"
C00910,6/7: Longitudinal evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on high-risk new and expectant mothers,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant environmental event in living history and is leading tounprecedented social, economic and health consequences. There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequences fortheir children's birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre-existingsubstance use, mental health conditions and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across seven geographically-representative sites from theNIH HEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University, OregonHealth Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter, University of Vermont and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartum women intoa multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial and substance use risk acrosspregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioral developmentduring the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatal COVID-19 relatedstress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress and infant temperament and neurodevelopmentand 2) substance use, mental health and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negative COVID-19 relatedhealth and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey, birth and postpartumdata will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers per site (providing a totalconsortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19 related experiences andresponses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohorts obtained prior to the pandemic.Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poor mental health and lowsocioeconomic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources as resilience factors thatinfluence COVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioral outcomes. The effects ofgeographic location will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity, variation in local governmentpolicies and resource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect and bank longitudinal perinatalbiospecimens in N=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the biologicalmechanisms through which the effects on maternal psychological and physical health influence offspring brainand behavioral development. Through this analysis of COVID-19 related stress, contextual factors and childoutcomes, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of effects and modifiers of this event on healthoutcomes in individuals that vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life, one of the most sensitive timepoints inhuman development.","4, 10","4a, 10a, 10b"
C04628,Optimising General Public Uptake of a Covid-19 Vaccine: A Mixed Methods Study (OPTIMUM),"The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 has disrupted people's daily lives in many parts of the world, including in the UK, and it has caused many people to become ill and even die. Scientists, policy makers and the general public hope that a Covid-19 vaccine will developed soon, to help to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in future.   As with any vaccination, it is very important that the public are confident in the vaccine so that most people will want to choose to have the vaccine.  A high uptake of the vaccine is needed to protect as many individuals from becoming ill as possible, and to  stop the spread of the virus. Recent studies suggest most people want a vaccine, but a minority of people are uncertain about whether they would want to be vaccinated against Covid-19. This seems to be because some people are worried about the safety of a new vaccine or do not have trust in the benefits of vaccination more generally. We want to understand more about what people see as the upsides and downsides of a new Covid-19 vaccine. This information will help to design a vaccination campaign that is trusted by people because it tells them what they want to - or need to - know before making a decision about having the vaccination. A good vaccination campaign would help to increase vaccine uptake, and help people separate facts about the vaccine from misinformed stories.  To understand what hopes and worries people have about a Covid-19 vaccine, we plan to do a study on people's attitudes towards a new Covid-19 vaccine. The study will have four parts. In the first part, we will interview 12-15 key people involved in vaccine policy and in providing vaccines in different parts of the UK. The interviews will ask about: plans for vaccine roll-out; expected barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake; communication challenges; key messages, channels and target groups, including professional and public; and any helfpul learning from other countries and other campaigns. In the second part, we will ask a sample of around 2,250 adults in the general population across Great Britain to take part in a survey about Covid-19 and a vaccine to prevent it. The people we ask will be a random sample of people who have taken part in the British Social Attitudes Survey in the past.  The survey will include questions in five key ares: (1) typical behaviour in the past for other vaccines (e.g. annual flu vaccination, childhood vaccination); (2) general attitudes to vaccination; (3) experience of Covid-19 infection and whether people feel they are likely to get Covid-19 in the future (e.g. tested positive, suspected infection, contact with people with Covid-19 through their work, being in some of the groups that were asked to 'shield'); (4) attitudes and beliefs towards a new Covid-19 vaccine (e.g. safety, effectiveness, accessibility, necessity, trust, sources of information about vaccination, responsibility to others); and (5) people's intentions (e.g. whether they think they would agree to be vaccinated). Participants will also be asked about views and use of the NHS Tracking App. In the third part, will will invite a smaller sample of about 30 people, including some people at higher risk of Covid-19, to take part in more in-depth interviews so that we can understand their hopes and concerns about the development and roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccine in much more detail.   In the last part of the study, we will go back to key people involved in vaccine policy and in providing vaccines in different parts of the UK and invite them to workshops so that they can hear about the study findings and use these to shape their information and plans to support high uptake of the vaccine.",9,"9a, 9c, 9d"

P23278,VTEU Supplement,"Project Summary/Abstract  The University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health  (CVD) has been an established VTEU site since 1974. The goal of the VTEUs is to initiate innovative concepts  for clinical research and implement clinical site protocols for evaluating vaccines, other preventive biologics,  therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, and CVD is  uniquely poised to accomplish this goal. CVD's expert and accomplished investigative team has  complementary skill sets in all areas necessary to address the NIAID priority areas, with established  management plans to effectively allocate work and conduct multiple projects simultaneously. CVD is  internationally recognized for our capacity and capability to conduct controlled human infection trials for  malaria, influenza, and enteric pathogens and to implement treatment and prevention trials in endemic areas  for malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTD), both of which have been a focus of its research for many  years. CVD has access to U.S. populations of healthy subjects in all age groups for this research and subjects  with special risks, such as patients attending outpatient clinics with sexually transmitted infection (STI) and  other conditions that generally do not requiring hospitalization. Strong domestic collaborations at sites  experienced in clinical trials provide the CVD's VTEU with surge capacity among healthy subjects of all ages  and vulnerable populations such as pregnant women in the U.S. to address public health emergencies. CVD's  international collaborators, including two long-standing permanent field sites in Africa, are an invaluable  resource for vetted international trial sites in low resource countries endemic for malaria and NTD with  experience in conducting high quality NIAID and VTEU studies. This proposal describes mechanisms to  implement protocols that arise from concepts proposed by the Leadership Group (LG) and the research  community including investigators from other VTEUs, academia, industry, non-governmental organizations,  and DMID. These concepts will focus on NIAID priority areas, including malaria, NTD, respiratory infections,  particularly influenza, enteric diseases, STI, and emerging infectious diseases and other infectious disease  considerations. Under our VTEU contract that is nearing completion (2013-2023), CVD was awarded over 23  Task Orders, enrolled over 1,500 participants, and successfully collaborated with national and international  sites. This renewal application is intended to supplement the new VTEU award (1UM1AI148689) that we  received in December, 2019 in response to AI18-046; funding for this award was limited to one year as a result  of an omission by our Sponsored Programs Administration to include a request for 7 full years of funding. The  current proposal seeks to supplement that one year award with an additional 6 years of funding.","6, 7","6j, 7j"
C17772,"Mapping the lipid envelope composition of SARS-CoV2 for reducing transmission, thrombosis and inflammation","Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, like influenza, Herpex Simplex and HIV. Thus, they are surrounded by a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell, in this case oral/lung epithelia. Surprisingly little is known about coronavirus membranes. Old studies suggest that virions bud from the phospholipid (PL)-rich ERGIC membrane, unlike many other enveloped viruses which bud from the plasma membrane, this a high level of PLs is likely. Importantly, the envelope of the SARS-CoV2 virus has not been mapped.     We successfully purified SARS-CoV2 virus from Vero cell cultures on sucrose gradients, validated purity by nanosight, and are analysing its lipid composition using established mass spectrometry protocols (Stanton/O'Donnell laboratories). We can detect common PL and the full repertoire is currently being mapped and quantified. However, this now needs to be extended using human patient virus isolates since the composition is predicted to depend on the host cell and its metabolism. Notably, how virus membranes vary dependent on the host is unknown. Virus will be isolated from saliva, sputum and BAL of hospitalised patients with COVID 19. We have already obtained BAL, and subglottic aspirates, from patients intubated on ITU, and isolated live virus with titres >104 PFU/ml. Saliva will be obtained from patients using infrastructure set up as part of our ongoing clinical trial (ISRCTN25647404). We have isolated virus from saliva (104 - 105 PFU/ml) from patients on our ward. Virally-infected epithelial cells can also be harvested from the nasal mucosa using direct brushing. We plan to obtain virus from asymptomatic students donating to our university testing centre (if samples are available at that time). Virus will be purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation (already validated using Vero-derived virus). Lipids will be extracted using a chloroform/methanol method before lipidomics as described below. As this is a pilot study, we will aim for 20 BAL and 50-100 saliva samples as first step. Ethical approval processes for observational studies are well established and we anticipate no problems.    A second approach will be to analyse virus cultured in A549 (human alveolar epithelial cell line transfected to overexpress ACE2 and TMPRSS2). This can be manipulated through exposure to cytokines consistent with the inflammatory status observed in COVID19 (PMID:32302401,32353870, 32678432). This model will allow scale up of virus isolation, enabling in-depth mechanistic studies to be undertaken. Virus will be cultured in A549 (+ACE2/TMPRSS2). The impact of inflammation will be tested using cytokines known to be elevated in COVID19, to mimic inflamed airway cytokine storm. These will include: IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-10, IL-17, IFNg, IFNg-inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), G-CSF, macrophage inflammatory protein 1a, and TNFa (PMID:32302401,32353870, 32678432). Two other cytokines of significant interest are IL-4/IL-13, known to play a key role in allergic lung diseases like asthma. IL-4/IL-13 will be tested +/- dexamethasone. Importantly, IL-4/IL-13 are inducers of procoagulant eoxPL generation in airway epithelia (PMCID:PMC5765418). It is therefore critical that we determine the impact these cytokines have on envelope composition, to determine how this may impact dissemination of bioactive lipids via the virion envelope. This will be conducted on in vitro and in vivo isolated virus  and to complement this we will also analyse the subcellular membranes of A549 cells.    Third, we will conduct a transcriptomic analysis of A549 cells during infection focusing on lipid metabolism. This will determine which lipid signalling pathways are utilised/hijacked by the virus to support replication (particularly PL synthesis), aiming to identify druggable targets for intervention based on interfering with the lipid","1, 4","1b, 4b"
P21889,Point-of-care antigen detection assay for early diagnosis of Ebola virus disease (EVD),"Project Summary  Ebolavirus spp. cause a severe hemorrhagic fever known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). EVD is  a serious public health concern, both as an emerging infectious disease and a potential  biothreat. The 2013-2016 Ebola pandemic in West Africa brought global attention to the  challenges associated with controlling an Ebola. The ongoing outbreak in the Democratic  Republic of Congo, which recently reached over 1000 cases with no signs of slowing, has only  confirmed the need for improved Ebola medical countermeasures. To better control Ebola  outbreaks, it is imperative for healthcare workers to be able to diagnosis and isolate infected  patients at the point-of-care in a timely manner. As such, the World Health Organization and  other healthcare agencies have called for development of Ebola rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).  The proposed joint effort, for development a point-of-care antigen detection assay for early  diagnosis of EVD, stems from a history of successful collaborations between the academic  laboratory of Dr. David AuCoin at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and commercial  partner, InBios International, Inc. The two organizations have valuable expertise in RDT  development and navigating the FDA approval process. The effort is further bolstered by  assistance from collaborators at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious  Diseases (USAMRIID) who will perform all high containment level (BSL4) studies.  Preliminary studies for this proposal have resulted in an Ebola RDT prototype that shows a  substantial improvement in sensitivity for Zaire ebolavirus. Our goal is to further improve assay  sensitivity and expand detection to all EVD causing Ebolavirus spp. A comprehensive approach  with clearly defined strategies will be used to support successful development of a pan-Ebola  RDT with high sensitivity. Key aspects and milestones include: i) high throughput monoclonal  antibody (mAb) production using multiple immunization strategies, ii) mAb characterization and  RDT-based mAb screening, iii) commercial optimization and development of multiple assay  prototypes, iv) determination of analytical sensitivity and specificity and v) assay validation with  samples from Ebola-infected non-human primates.",1,1a

C10632,Reducing Risk and Promoting Health Among Vulnerable Teens and their Families in the Context of COVID-19:  A Multisite National and International Implementation and Evaluation Study,"COVID-19 and the associated public health response (e.g., physical distancing) have had significant negative impacts on the mental health of youths and their families. This is particularly notable among vulnerable teens with pre-existing mental health challenges and families experiencing high levels of interpersonal conflict. Concerns that vulnerable teens may leave their family homes and be unable to return due to the risk of COVID-19 transmission are rising. During these difficult times, caregiver depression, stress, and family violence is likely to increase. Evidence-based interventions supporting vulnerable families are critical to combating these challenges. Connect is an evidence based, trauma-informed, attachment-focused program that promotes effective parenting skills (mindfulness, empathy, emotion regulation), and parent-teen collaborative problem solving. National and international studies have demonstrated that Connect reduces family conflict, caregiver depression and stress, and improves family satisfaction. Furthermore, mental health problems (oppositional behavior, anxiety and depression) are reduced amongst teens whose parents complete the program. While structured, Connect can be flexibly adapted to suit unique cultures and contexts. In response to the call for online mental services for vulnerable populations, we have created eConnect Online, a program that specifically addresses the challenges associated with parenting vulnerable youth in the context of COVID-19. The current project evaluates the challenges (related to COVID-19 or otherwise) of families at the start of the program, implementation, uptake, and evaluation of eConnect Online through a global network of researchers, health agencies, clinicians and families in developed and developing countries. As collaboration and knowledge sharing are cornerstones of this project, we will use feedback from families and service providers to inform future implementations of eConnect Online.","9, 10","9a, 10a"
C03110,Presence of viable SARS-CoV-2 virus in surgical smoke produced during electrocautery,"Electrocautery is an important, and in many cases, essential tool used during surgery.  It is well established that electrocautery can produce aerosol, and previous studies have demonstrated that some viruses can be carried in the vapours from cautery.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, out of an abundance of caution, protocols have been put in place to minimize potential exposure to this smoke that significantly reduce the capacity in our healthcare system to do surgery.  High level personal protective equipment is required for these procedures when they do occur, and much of that equipment is currently in short supply.   This study will be done in a biohazard level 3 laboratory and will examine if the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is viable and present in the smoke produced by using cautery.  This study will collect the smoke from using two different types of cautery on blood from a patient with COVID-19, from blood inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and from cauterizing a culture plate with SARS-CoV-2. The vapour will then be cultured to see if SARS-CoV-2 can be grown, thus demonstrating if viable virus is aerosolized during cautery.  Another test (RT-PCR) will be used to look for RNA from the virus to see if any is present in the smoke. A positive control will be done using aerosolized blood from the same samples.   The results from this study, whether positive or negative, will important implications.  If positive, it will have a critical and direct impact on ensuring the safety of healthcare workers performing procedures on patients.  Procedures using cautery will continue to require high level protection if the COVID status of the patient is unknown. If negative, it will significantly improve the ability of our healthcare system to perform surgical procedures safely and effectively, and conserving critical protective equipment for cases that need it.","1, 5","1f, 5c"
C08228,Cash and Compliance with Social Distancing: Experimental Evidence from Ghana,"As coronavirus begins to spread in developing countries, an important question is whether poor households will adhere to social distancing given the likely inability to work remotely, and the subsequent large income losses. In such a context, mobile money transfers may not only help households maintain consumption levels, they may also complement social distancing policies - those that get the cash may work less, and stay at home more. We are launching a three-arm mobile money transfer study in Ghana to test this idea. Specifically, using a subset of relatively low-income households from the Ghana Panel Survey (a representative panel dataset collected over the last decade) we will randomly assign households to a treatment group that receives eight weekly transfers or a control group the receives only a single transfer. We will examine effects on a battery of economic and psychological measures of well-being as well as adherence with social distancing and self-isolation.","9, 10","9a, 10a, 10c"
P23470,"ExeVir's XVR011, a best in class nanobody-based biology that broadly neutralizes SARS-COV-1 and SARS-COV-2","XVR011, ExeVir's clinical lead candidate has emerged from scientific research from labs of highly regarded virologist Xavier Saelens and biochemist Nico Callewaert. Nonclinical data has recently been published in Cell and a preprint on BiorxIV. XVR011 is a nanobody-Fc fusion, has best-in-class potential, neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and minimizes the development of lung damage in hamsters. The lama-derived single-domain antibodies are smaller than human antibodies and can attach to parts of a virus that are difficult to access for the human immune system. XVR011 inactivates spike proteins and sterically blocks spike binding to ACE2, preventing virus from entering a human cell, stopping viral replication; this supplements the patient's own immune response in a critical time window during which many COVID-19 patient's immune system reacts too slowly, giving it more time to do its job and eliminate the virus. It binds to a unique highly conserved epitope in the viral receptor-binding domain. Its epitope is much less susceptible to human antibody immunity pressure that can lead to viral escape, resulting in retained potency against such escape variants. It thus neutralises the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, and exhibits a unique, wide scope binding across the Sarbecovirus clades. Furthermore, XVR011 has been optimized for stability, safety and manufacturability. XVR011 received approval from the Belgium regulators to move into its Phase 1b. Seven IP patents were filed early on during the pandemic. ExeVir has surrounded itself with both a team of experienced entrepreneurs and is backed by a mix of private and public experienced partners and has a strong board of directors bringing with expertise across the whole value chain. The objectives of this proposal is to demonstrate XVR011 safety and efficacy in a global Phase 2; to strengthen its nonclinical package including neutralising variants data, set-up its manufacturing process and progress its regulatory pathway.","1, 6","1c, 1d, 6c, 6d"
P23551,Nanoscale virus imaging X-ray microscope based on incoherent diffraction,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that emerged in late 2019. By March 2020, the outbreak was declared a devastating pandemic and¬†clearly illustrated the threat that viruses pose to our society. The characterization of viral structures¬†and the identification of key proteins involved in each step of the cycle of infection are crucial to developing treatments. Yet imaging single viruses can only be performed in a few specialized centers in Europe, while every hospital could benefit from it. ¬†NanoXCAN proposes to develop a tabletop¬†virus imaging X-ray microscope, with foreseeable impact as revolutionary as the invention of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy, paving the way towards¬†determination of structure and dynamics of matter to a large community. For this purpose, we will develop an original digital laser that delivers, on a daily operation, subwavelength focusing, reaching relativistic intensities at MHz repetition rates. This will be used to create a nano-source of hard X-rays from the Kalpha plasma emission of metallic nano-targets¬†at an average power comparable to that of a synchrotron beamline.¬† We will capitalize on this high brilliance, high¬†average power hard X-ray source to perform lensless nanoscale biomedical imaging based on recent findings in incoherent imaging and machine learning. All these¬†ingredients will create a unique nanoscopy platform that our consortium will illustrate by imaging a single virus. In the future, our X-ray IDI microscope could help¬†to study mechanisms involved in viral infection and antiviral design. X-rays have the advantage of performing in-situ non-destructive and non-invasive imaging over competing techniques.

C15288,Sex specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to chronic neurologic symptoms,"PROJECT SUMMARY  To date over 16 million people in the US have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the vast  majority will survive the acute illness, many are at risk for experiencing long-term symptoms after the acute  illness. Acute neurologic symptoms including encephalitis, strokes and seizures have been reported in COVID-  19 patients. Increasingly, even survivors without acute neurologic conditions have reported neuropsychiatric  symptoms (NPS) months after their illness. The incidence and factors that influence the development of long-  term NPS is unknown. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a systemic pro-inflammatory response termed `cytokine  storm', characterized by an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory molecules. The consequences of  uncontrolled systemic inflammation on the brain and the link to long-term NPS after COVID-19 is unknown.  Sex differences in the outcome from COVID-19 are increasingly evident. Men have worse outcomes with  acute COVID-19 infection, with higher hospitalization rates and mortality, an effect seen globally. Sex  differences in the immune  literature  acute  inflammatory  circulating  immune  responses underlie the differences i n the acute disease course, as seen both in t he  and in our preliminary data. We have found that men have a more robust innate immune response to  COVID-19 infection, with increased circulating neutrophils and monocytes and higher serum levels of  cytokines and markers of brain injury (neuron specific enolase). In contrast, women have more  T and B cells in response to acute infection compared to men, hallmarks of an antigen-specific  response.Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that women however, may be disproportionally  affected by the chronic effects of infection, including higher rates of NPS. To examine the mechanism of NPS,  we propose a longitudinal, prospective study to assess the impact of acute and chronic inflammation on  markers of brain injury, and long-term NPS for up to 2 years after COVID-19 infection. To accomplish this, we  will leverage our prospective clinical biorepository and long-term COVID-19 follow-up clinic. To date, over 400  hospitalized COVID-19 patients from three different hospitals have been enrolled into a prospective  biorepository and Houston is now at the verge of another surge. Identifying patients at risk for developing  chronic consequences of COVID-19 infection, and discovering potential underlying mechanisms leading to  NPS will be critical to the enhance the health of millions of COVID-19 survivors.","1, 4","1d, 4b, 4d"
C03899,Homebound with Dementia in the Context of COVID-19,"Homebound with Dementia in the Context of COVID-19Summary/AbstractIndividuals with dementia live for many years at home in the community. Even though the community is theoverwhelming preference for site of care, the experience of living with dementia in the community is challengingfor patients and their caregiving families. In the existing parent grant, we examine how being homebound impactsthe lived experience of individuals with dementia using the longitudinal, nationally representative National Healthand Aging Trends Study and the companion National Study of Caregivers with linkages to Medicare claims, theU.S Census, and other geographic data. In this supplement, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on homeboundadults with dementia and their caregiving families in the epicenter of the pandemic, New York City. Usingroutinely collected data within the Mount Sinai Health System, we will examine change in care delivery forhomebound patients during COVID-19 outbreak in NYC, compare end-of-life care experiences for homeboundpatients and caregivers before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and conduct an in-depth analysis ofcare disruptions for homebound patients with dementia during COVID-19. In summary, this project will criticallyenhance our understanding of the lived experience of patients with dementia by examining their experienceaccessing care throughout this pandemic. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, homebound older adults with dementiafaced social isolation and routine challenges to accessing healthcare. Patients are highly reliant on familycaregivers for daily support.1 In the wake of this pandemic, there are tremendous and unprecedented challengesfor these individuals and their caregivers who support them. The proposed study will allow for the firstdocumentation of the homebound experience before, during, and after the peak of COVID-19 infections in NewYork City and will set the stage for new guidelines and research into emergency preparedness, programadaptations and partnerships with community organizations for persons living with dementia in the communityand their caregiving families.",10,10a
P21696,Spillover of Ebola and other filoviruses at ecological boundaries,"More than half of all infectious disease outbreaks across the globe are zoonotic, involving pathogen spillover from animal reservoirs to humans. Ebola and other filoviruses rank among the most deadly zoonoses. Recent large outbreaks with mortality in the thousands both in humans and wildlife underscore the pressing need to better understand the factors promoting filovirus spillover. Although spillover is commonly defined as a pathogen crossing species boundaries, there are relatively few empirical studies or modeling frameworks that explicitly consider ecological boundaries across which spillover occurs. Crossing ecological boundaries involves processes that occur at many levels of organization: physiological processes at the individual level, interspecies interactions between individuals at the population level, interactions between populations of different species at the community level, and interactions between ecological communities within landscapes. Processes accelerating spillover often involve human activities such as habitat encroachment and land conversion, which are themselves ultimately driven by socioeconomic factors. In the context of Ebola and other filoviruses in Africa, we will develop the data sets, theoretical models and statistical tools needed for a general descriptive and predictive framework for spillover at ecological boundaries. Our project will follow an iterative design where results from mechanistic models are used to refine patterns that we test for empirically, and statistical models of large-scale data allow us to more realistically parameterize mechanistic models. Our work will test the generality of specific theories that so far have been applied only to a limited number of study systems. For example, ours will be among the first attempts to test the influence of SchmalhausenÃ¢Â€Â™s law -- an evolutionary theory that may explain the tendency for large outbreaks to occur at the edges of species ranges or during unusual weather conditions and which to date has primarily been investigated in the context of malaria -- in pathogens that rely on direct transmission. This work will demonstrate how new methods can provide unifying insight into patterns in critically important disease transmission systems and will enhance our ability to predict spillover of both filoviruses and many other zoonotic pathogens. Note that no human subjects, biohazards, or select agents will be involved in this project.",2,2a
P22937,Human Genetic Variation Regulating Transcriptional Response and Cellular Susceptibility to Influenza,"Project Summary/Abstract  It is estimated that 50-100 million people (~5% of the global population) died from the 1918 influenza pandemic.  While influenza infections usually do not cause such severe disease, ~30 million are infected every year in the  United States alone (2014-2015). However, there are broad differences in influenza susceptibility and severity,  with outcomes from asymptomatic infections (~16%) to death (0.2% in 2014-2015). These differences arise from  the complex interplay of exposure, environment, influenza genetics, and human genetics.  The overall goal of my lab is to understand how human genetic diversity regulates susceptibility and severity of  infections. Famous examples of genetic differences that profoundly impact susceptibility include sickle cell allele  protection against malaria and CCR5 deletion protection against HIV. Such genetic differences can lead to  insights on pathogenesis, drug targets (e.g. CCR5 inhibitors), and more personalized care. For influenza,  common genetic variation has been most convincingly shown to influence flu severity at a single locus (IFITM3)  that regulates a single step (cytosolic entry) in the complex influenza life cycle. We hypothesize that other human  genetic differences affect influenza infection and can be identified through measuring inter-individual variation in  cellular infection phenotypes. To facilitate identification of SNPs that affect cellular infection phenotypes, we  developed and validated a cell-based GWAS approach called Hi-HOST. SNPs identified as important for  influenza infection by Hi-HOST can then be examined for relevance in human infection using already completed  human flu challenge studies and population-based studies. We propose that the intersection of human subject  and cell line data facilitates discovery of novel pathways and genetic determinants of susceptibility.  This project will generate a high resolution analysis of how human genetic variants impact transcription,  cellular phenotypes, and human disease following influenza exposure. We will accomplish this through 1)  identifying human SNPs that confer resistance/susceptibility to cellular and molecular phenotypes of flu infection,  including entry, replication, cell death, cytokine levels, and host transcriptional responses, 2) determining the  impact of SNPs on host transcription during influenza challenge of healthy volunteers, and 3) integrating the  generated cellular and human challenge datasets to generate and test hypotheses linking transcriptional  response and cellular susceptibility. Understanding these differences could lead to new diagnostic approaches  in identifying at-risk individuals and novel therapeutic strategies for treatment.",1,1d
C15236,Targeting Coronavirus through Nucleocapsid Phosphorylation,"Summary  Coronaviruses express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and virion  assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV (responsible for SARS) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-  3) is required for its function. GSK-3 inhibition attenuates infectivity of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses and  is therefore an intriguing therapeutic strategy for coronavirus infections. Lithium, a widely used medication,  directly inhibits GSK-3 and impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, replication, and infectivity of diverse  coronaviruses. However, GSK-3 phosphorylation of N protein from SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID19) has  not been reported. This proposal leverages our long-standing expertise with GSK-3 to block N function  and SARS-CoV-2 replication. In a preliminary review of 70,000 subjects undergoing PCR testing for SARS-  CoV-2, we found that patients on lithium had reduced risk of COVID19 (odds ration = 0.5 [0.36 - 0.80], p =  0.0002). We show that phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by lithium and that other GSK-3  inhibitors block N phosphorylation with IC50s in the low micromolar range. GSK3 loss of function supports that  GSK-3 is required for SARS-CoV-2 N protein phosphorlyation. We identified clinically-tolerated drugs that  unexpectedly inhibit GSK-3 and impair N phosphorylation at clinically-tolerated levels. Aim 1 of this proposal  describes approaches to enhance inhibition of N phosphorylation by lithium and by selective GSK-3 inhibitors,  with a focus on those shown to be safe in humans through clinical trials for other diseases. As GSK-3  phosphorylation of N protein requires pre-phosphorylation at a distinct site by another, unkown protein kinase,  Aim 2 will identify and target the priming kinase as an alternative strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 transcription  and replication. This aim will also test whether inhibitors of either GSK-3 or the priming kinase interfere with  replication of other pathogenic coronaviruses. If successful, the project will identify clinically safe  medications that can be repurposed to treat COVID19 as well as future coronavirus outbreaks.",6,6a
C12421,COVID-19 and mental health: cultural adaptation and validation of instruments for the Brazilian context,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest public health emergency facing the international community in decades. In addition to concerns about physical health, it also brings concerns about mental health, since psychological suffering can be experienced by the general population and by the health professionals involved, directly impacting their quality of life. The intensification of feelings such as fear, anger, stress, insecurity and frustration are associated with an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders. In this context, the availability of measurement instruments related to COVID-19 and Mental Health, adapted and validated for the Brazilian context, is of great relevance, as for measuring anxiety (COVID Anxiety Scale - CAS) and the threat perceived by COVID-19 (Perceived Coronavirus Threat Questionnaire -PCTQ) and the impact of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire - CIQ). They are instruments that have shown reliability and validity in their original version, developed in other cultures, such as India and the United States and that, through this study, will be made available in Brazil and may guide the conduct taken by health professionals and competent authorities, and the elaboration of public health care policy plans, aiming to prevent the population's injuries. In view of the above, the present study has the general objective of translating, adapting and validating CAS, PCTQ and CIQ for the Brazilian context. This is a methodological study, which will respect the steps recommended by Beaton et al. (2000), which are: translation, synthesis of translations, back-translation, evaluation by a committee of experts, pre-test, presentation and evaluation of reports on the process of cultural adaptation and analysis of the psychometric properties of these instruments. The researchers who developed the tools authorized the process of validating them in Brazil and are associated researchers in the proposal. All ethical precepts will be respected and the project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). The development of this study will enable several results, such as the availability of several instruments related to COVID-19 and Mental Health. In addition, it will enhance the international partnership of the proposing researcher with new international research groups of excellence in the subject investigated. The stages of data collection will be carried out online, after the free and informed consent of the participants (in different stages), with the completion of the data collection instruments through google forms, being disseminated at national level, respecting the eligibility criteria previously established. Statistical analyzes will be carried out at different stages of the research, such as descriptive, correlation and confirmatory factor analysis, among others, in order to verify the evidence of reliability and validity of the Brazilian version of the instruments analyzed. It is important to highlight that the proposed research project is original, innovative, with great scientific relevance and notorious applicability for the current pandemic context that we are experiencing.

C12416,Serum vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients: prevalence of hypovitaminosis and associated factors,"In December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China, as the agent of respiratory infections, including cases of respiratory failure and death. The virus called SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly to more than 180 countries, including Brazil, causing an international alarm and pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. However, despite the epidemiological importance, additional information on SARS-CoV- 2 are necessary to better understand the transmission, pathophysiology, disease severity factors and risks for the general population. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory properties, including the regulation of inflammatory cytokines, and may have a preventive role in the evolution of acute lung injury. It is plausible that vitamin D may have a protective role against SARS-CoV-2, reducing the severity of pneumonia and the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there are no studies on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and the factors associated with this condition in the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Considering this knowledge gap, the present study aims to assess serum vitamin D levels in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as to identify factors associated with this deficiency, especially inflammatory and oxidative stress variables. The project is an observational, cross-sectional study with patients of both sexes, aged 18 years or older and hospitalized with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. (AU)",4,4b

Given the vaccine and specific antiviral treatment forCOVID-19 will take months or years to finalize, preventive behaviors remain the most effective strategy thusfar.Adapted from the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) used in the parent R01 for smartphones, we planto develop a self-monitoring EMA (SM-EMA) intervention to collect real-time behavior data and promoteadherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors. The central hypothesis of this study is that tailored-feedbackmessages via SM-EMA, a theory-based intervention, will improve knowledge and self-efficacy, which willconsequently lead to self-guided implementation of CDC-recommended preventative behaviors.The proposed research addresses the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on African Americans who are aparticularly vulnerable population. It is innovative in its large-scale testing of a novel SM-EMA to reinforcepreventive behaviors and its examination of the sustainability of engagement.

C07319,"Virtual Justice: Enhancing accessibility, participation and procedural justice in family courts and tribunals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Perceptions of accessibility and fairness are central to civil order and the legitimacy of the legal system and state. COVID-19 and social distancing rules have forced radical changes upon the justice system with many trials now having to take place online from participants' homes with no one being present in a physical courtroom. There is currently no online support to prepare members of the public for appearing in court from their own home or to guide them around these  new virtual spaces. This poses a number of challenges to the validity of the process with many interest groups expressing concern about due process and the dangers of alienating court users from the process. There are particular concerns about the ability of the digitally impoverished, vulnerable and other lay users to participate effectively in this new way of doing justice. Working in partnership with Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service this project will draw on existing  research and extensive consultation with the public, court staff, interest groups, practitioners and policy makers to produce a central repository of good practice materials and a series of audiovisual  guides.

P21306,Opening new windows into viruses inside the cell by electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET),"As the Caltech physicist Richard Feynman once explained, ""It is very easy to answer many fundamental biological questions; you just look at the thing!"". If we could simply look at a virus inside a eukaryotic cell and observe all the host and virus molecules interacting with one another in their native state, we would vastly improve our understanding of the virus life cycle and the cellular innate immune responses. In fact, several key historical breakthroughs in virology and cellular biology have been made through advances in imaging technologies. The development of traditional electron microscopy (EM) led to the first detailed pictures of a virus and later the fine ultrastructure of cellular organelles such as the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Successive technological advances have brought us to the point that we are able to image viruses at close to atomic resolution, a feat recognized by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 'for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution"". With recent electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) technology developments, we are in touching distance of visualizing any virus in its native state and context within the cell. For the first time, all stages of a viral replication cycle from attachment and entry through genome replication to morphogenesis and egress may be visualized at macromolecular resolution. This is an exceedingly exciting moment to work in this field. This new technology affords us the opportunity to solve the structure of viral proteins in their natural habitat with unprecedented resolution.     To understand virus-host interactions using cryo-ET technology I am proposing to address a number of important biological questions targeting the virus order Bunyavirales. Viruses in this order are representative of many emerging viruses which pose a high-risk to human and animal health. In cryo-ET, samples are plunged into a cryogen (liquid ethane, or a mixture of ethane and propane), preserving them in a frozen-hydrated, near-native state. The frozen samples are then imaged in a transmission electron microscope, and a series of 2-D projection images are recorded as the sample is rotated incrementally around an axis. This so-called ""tilt-series"" is then reconstructed into a 3-D ""tomogram"", with typical resolution sufficient to make out the shapes and arrangement of large macromolecules (~5 nm). If the tomogram, or a set of tomograms, contains structurally homogeneous copies of an object of interest, ""tomogram subvolumes"" containing the objects can be computationally extracted, aligned and combined, a process we call ""subtomogram averaging"" (STA) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and clarify details, typically improving the resolution to ~2-3 nm. For exceptionally favorable samples such as pseudo-crystalline protein coats on cells or viruses, the resolution of STA can be pushed to even 3.1A, sufficient to build atomic models de novo.     To learn about important aspects of Bunyavirales biology, my research will apply state of the art technologies, such as cryo-CLEM, cryo-FIB milling, cryo-ET and STA to visualize infection of the related viruses TOSV and RVFV (Phenuiviridae) in situ at high-resolution. Using these techniques, I will look for novel structural aspects of both the pro- and antiviral processes that take place during the immune response and the triggering of the antiviral innate immune response of the cell. More specifically I will investigate (i) restriction of the virus RNPs by the MxA restriction factor, and (ii) the architecture of TOSV and RVFV host response antagonist NSs filaments inside the nucleus. Identifying new structures and key interactions between the virus and the host will be a step change in understanding fundamental aspects of viral replication and the host antiviral responses and might even allow for new insights into host targeted therapeutics.",1,1b
C06356,"Mapping the spread of SARS-CoV-2: size of the outbreak, transmission dynamics, clinical outcomes of the infection and duration of antibody responses in a small Amazonian city","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally and now represents an important challenge for low- and middle-income countries, where health infrastructure can quickly become overburdened. This proposal is part of our ongoing field research, funded by FAPESP, to investigate the epidemiology and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mâncio Lima, a small Amazonian city. The general objective is to translate the information generated by the field study into evidence to guide the control of COVID-19 in one of the poorest regions of Brazil. We start from the hypothesis that many SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unnoticed and asymptomatic carriers of the infection may continue to spread the pathogen in their daily social interactions until its spontaneous elimination, becoming immune to reinfections or, at least, to serious illness. . The proposed means to test this hypothesis are: (a) to use serial serological assays to retrospectively detect seroconversion events, estimate the size of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and identify risk factors associated with seroconversion in the community; (b) identify social interactions and shared spaces, such as home, workplace, schools and churches, that may have contributed to the local transmission of SARS-Cov-2; (c) calculate the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections diagnosed retrospectively that remained asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, usually without prior diagnosis, and those associated with the disease (COVID-19), resulting in visits to health services and even even in hospitalization, and (d) determining the proportion of individuals who, when they become seropositive during the outbreak, remain with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 over the next 12 months.","1, 3","1d, 3a, 3b"

Covid-19 attacks humans regardless of age, claiming the life of over 8,000 people in a single day, with a devastating death toll exceeding 350,000 in just a few months. The virus is likely to survive for the foreseeable future and disperse further, requiring long-term planning and investment in developing means of detection, protection and cure. Protective measures based on monitoring the dispersion of the coronavirus in the environment and fast screening of individuals has become paramount for ensuring safety of our ageing population and restarting/supporting the worldwide economy. The objective of the ARIADNE project is to develop a multiple-stage analytical platform based on multi-dimensional mass spectrometry instrumentation. Performing direct and instant detection of intact virus particles in breath and in water, and going far beyond that task, this unique analytical platform will push the scientific boundaries in all aspects of analytical sciences centered on mass spectrometry, incorporating a series of potentially disruptive technologies integrated into a single system. ARIADNE integrates state-of-the-art technological advancements in breath sampling and post-ionization methods, new analytical tools for characterization of the protein content of viruses by top-down mass spectrometry, non-destructive ultra-high mass analysis of single particles followed by their soft landing and further processing based on advanced single proteomic workflows.

C06184,"CONtact TrAcing in Care homes using digital Technology (CONTACT) - A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial, cost-effectiveness evaluation and theory-informed process evaluation.","Background: 400,000 people live in ~115,000 care homes with and without nursing. With no COVID-19 vaccine, 80% infection and 50% mortality rates in some homes, testing and crucially - contact tracing must become business-as-usual in homes for effective infection control, mortality reduction and minimising community transmission. Traditional contact tracing in care homes is ineffective: ~70% of residents have a cognitive deficit/dementia making reliable recall unfeasible and care staff would need to recall >50 contacts a day. Interview and document-based tracing is labour intensive, expensive and extremely burdensome. Small, wearable, inexpensive, digital devices within secure 'plug and play' wireless networks in homes can provide reliable real-time and historic contact data. Wearables can increase the quantity and quality of contact data, with almost zero burden, using technologies similar to those already present in homes: access fobs, cards and wristbands. The information produced can help homes plan and evaluate infection control procedures such as cohorting of residents/staff, environmental zoning and modification. Systematic reviews of care home infection control suggest 30% improvements in mortality are possible.     Research question: Are wearable digital contact tracing devices and tailored feedback of results (the CONTACT intervention) a cost-effective means of contact tracing in care homes, improving infection control and COVID-19 resident infection rates and reducing mortality, compared with contact tracing as usual in homes (the controls)?     Research design: pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with embedded cost effectiveness analysis, and theory-informed process evaluation.     Methods: Over 12 months, residents, staff and visitors in 64 care homes - (80% power to detect a 25-40% improvement in infection rates) in Yorkshire and Midlands will be randomised to the CONTACT intervention or control arms. After brief training for staff and base station installation, CONTACT will provide real time and retrospective data to each home and NHS test and trace services on all individual-individual and individual-home environment contacts (e.g.kitchens,corridors) in homes. Tailored information on contact patterns and trends, including frequency and constituents of contact(s), environment 'pinch points', and deviations from infection control procedures (cohorting/zoning) will be fed back monthly as an emailed PDF and via an electronic dashboard website for each home. Economic data on costs and resource use will be analysed and expressed as £-per-infection-avoided and willingness-to-pay. Determinants for embedding the CONTACT technology will be explored using a mixed method (QUANT|QUAL) process evaluation based on Normalisation Process Theory. Primary analysis of clinical effectiveness will be differences in infection rates (+PCR swab test) and all-cause mortality.     Impacts: CONTACT will enable care homes to plan and evaluate infection control procedures efficiently, increasing the likelihood of lower mortality from COVID-19. CONTACT will provide data otherwise unavailable to the NHS Test and Trace system, ensuring contact data does not start and finish at the care home door . It will facilitate more and safer visiting, constructive conversations between homes and the NHS regarding viral transmission risks and offer a minimal-burden approach for care homes to contribute to reducing the impact of COVID-19 on communities.","5, 9","5a, 9a"
C07251,"DAT 18-06 Feasibility and Acceptability of HIV, HCV, and Opioid Use Disorder Services in Syringe Service Programs","PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 threatens to exacerbate the national opioid crisis by reducing availability and access to harmreduction and health services delivered by syringe service programs (SSPs). Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the availability and delivery of harm reduction and health services by SSPs in the U.S. over time is imperative for guiding local and national opioid policies. Failure to restore services will require additional responses to avoid adverse consequences, including HIV and hepatitis C outbreaks, whereas potentially beneficial responses, such as eliminating 1:1 syringe exchange requirements, should be disseminated widely.    This supplement proposes collecting and analyzing longitudinal data on the impact of recovery from COVID-19 on SSPs. We will describe the changes in national SSP services in response to COVID-19 over one year via qualitative interviews and short surveys with SSPs every 6 months. Interviews will explore changes in harmreduction and health services offered; funding, adoption and sustainment of innovative services and servicedelivery; and barriers and facilitators for SSPs to delivering different services over a year. Descriptive data analysis will be conducted to determine if programs recover, maintain, or adapt services 6 and 12 months afterthe baseline survey. Qualitative data will be analyzed using content analysis. We will also conduct alongitudinal analysis to determine the associations between COVID-19 reported infections, COVID-19response policies, and SSP services delivered. SSPs registered with the North American Syringe ExchangeNetwork will be invited to participate in the longitudinal study that will collect monthly data on 1) number ofsyringes dispensed, 2) number of naloxone kits dispensed, 3) estimated number of participants served (directlyand through secondary exchange), and 4) whether the SSP offered any on-site HIV or HCV testing in thatmonth. COVID-19 reported infections and policies will be derived from publicly available data sources. We will conduct interrupted time series analysis to determine if changes in local COVID-19 stay-at-home policies areassociated with changes in the monthly number of syringes and naloxone distributed and per client rates,taking into account reported local infection rates. Time-to-event analysis will be used to assess the impact ofCOVID-19 infection rates and policies on HIV and HCV testing. Results will be disseminated to national andlocal policy makers to support decision making for harm reduction and health services provided to people who inject drugs.","9, 10","9e, 10a"

More specifically, the study will assess changes for PWID in terms of: (i) risk behaviours for HIV and HCV infections related to drug use; (ii) access and adherence to opioid substitution therapy (OST); (iii) access and adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) for those HIV-infected; (iv) access to harm reduction materials.  Secondary Objectives:  - To assess changes for PWID in terms of: (i) access to drugs and patterns of drug use; (ii) risk behaviours related to sex practices; (iii) access to counselling and support from health care staff, peer educators and members of community-based organizations (CBO); (iv) quality of life; (v) mental health, with a focus on suicidal risk, depression, psychotic syndrome and anxiety; (vi) individual social and economic situation; (vii) occurrence of administrative events (including incarceration); (viii) occurrence of life-threatening events (including overdose, suicide) and episodes of violence; (ix) access and adherence to psychiatric treatment for patients enrolled in the ANRS 12410 DRIVE-MIND study. We will also model the impact in terms of excess HIV and HCV infections and relative increase in HIV and HCV incidence resulting from changes due to the lockdown compared to if pre-lockdown behaviours and access to interventions had remained.  Methodology  Study design: before-after design approach, supplemented by a qualitative component and mathematical modelling.  The measurement of study outcomes during the 'before' (restriction) period will be drawn from the latest visit of either NIDA RO1DA041978/ANRS 12353 DRIVE, ANRS 12380 DRIVE-C or ANRS 12410 DRIVE-MIND studies. The same outcomes will be measured during the 'after' (restriction) period through a cross-sectional survey, conducted after the lifting of restrictive measures: during a specific follow-up visit organized for DRIVE participants; during the 'End of study' visit for DRIVE-C participants as planned in the DRIVE-C study; during the month-18 follow-up visit for DRIVE-MIND participants as planned in the DRIVE-MIND study. Potential changes that occurred specifically during the restriction  period will be assessed retrospectively during this survey, that will also be complemented by data collection in treatment clinics and from CBO.  The qualitative component will include 2 phases: (i) a preliminary work based on focus group discussions (FGD) with CBO members, and (ii) in-depth interviews with participants during the study data collection period.  The modelling component will use a HIV and HCV transmission model being developed for the ANRS 12380 DRIVE-C study, utilising new data collected by DRIVE-COVID to parameterise how lockdown has changed behaviours and intervention outcomes.  - Estimated enrolment: (i) cross-sectional survey: 930 participants; (ii) qualitative component: 20-30 participants.  Primary endpoint:  The changes in HIV and HCV risk behaviours and in access to prevention and care for PWID will be assessed through four main indicators, compared before and after the period of COVID-19-related restrictive measures: (i) self-reported frequency of sharing needles/syringes and water/Novocain; (ii) proportion of PWID receiving OST and adherence to OST (urine testing, self-assessment and medical file); (iii) proportion of HIV-infected PWID receiving ART and adherence to ART (HIV viral load testing for all HIV-infected, self-assessment and medical file); (iv) self-reported number of sterile needles/syringes accessed per month.

C09494,Co-producing knowledge about the impacts of emergencies/pandemics: developing remote participatory visual methods using smartphones,"The goal of this project is to respond to the challenges of methodological co-production and participatory action research - which are almost always conducted in person face-to-face - that arise during emergencies by developing an innovative remote participatory visual method using smartphones. In collaboration with migrant women in Colombia and a Londonbased film company, we will co-develop and test a novel and pioneering remote participatory visual method for coproduction researchers by applying participatory filming remotely to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's new lived realities of urban life. The whole research process, from development to dissemination, will be conducted online. During emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face research becomes impossible through travel and social contact restrictions. Many researchers have been stalled immediately prior to, or during, data collection, but the need to work with research participants remains. The same can occur in contexts of climate emergencies, disasters, conflict affected areas or in situations where there is not enough funding available for international travel. This is particularly challenging in transnational research and where collaborative research methodologies conducted with marginalised communities in times of such crisis become even more pressing. A remote participatory visual methodology provides a solution to continue or initiate participatory work, whilst ensuring that co-production and impact research still holds the potential to create social change and transformation of past, current and evolving issues.  One of the most promising solutions to be able to co-produce knowledge without face-to-face in-person contact is the use of smartphones to collect and share audio, visual and written data. The increased use of smartphones worldwide provides an opportunity for researchers to connect to participants transnationally remotely and for participants to still being able to express their voice. A remote participatory visual methodology may thus offer deep insights during emergencies, coproduced with participants to include those whose voices are traditionally unheard, while working towards the equalisation of power-relationships during the research process. To successfully develop a pioneering remote participatory visual method in this project, an interdisciplinary research team in the UK and Colombia consisting of Geography, Sociology, International Development, Filmmaking and Education and Human Rights scholars and a London-based film company will explore and test the methodological, ethical and technical challenges and possibilities of the use of smartphones for remote participant recruitment and participatory visual data collection. In collaboration with migrant women in Colombia, we will produce four filming and evaluation cycles, during which we will train researchers and participants in filming techniques, while at the same time collecting filmed material to produce short films of how the pandemic impacts the women's negotiation of their gendered right to the city in Medellin and Bogotá. Methodologically, the research will develop, pilot and evaluate a novel remote participatory visual method that can shift the co-production research landscape and make this form of research more accessible in contexts that have been excluded because of lack of face-to-face access to participants. The project will produce training materials for social science researchers. Substantively, the research project will contribute co-produced knowledge about women's gendered right to the city, including the voices of vulnerable women who are frequently absent from contemporaneous commentaries of emergencies and disasters, especially in situations where face-to-face contact is impossible or undesirable.",10,10d
C15335,Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery of SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACT  The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for  hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding  of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes  the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl  methionine (SAM) to 2'-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0  (m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell's mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot  distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only  tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own  proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral  infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of  the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2'-OH  methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is  unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are  unique to SARS-CoV-2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long-  term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion  from the host's immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap  modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for  therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in  every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed  biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly  of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will  develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We  will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small  molecules. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a  bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to  determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently  described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and  associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",1,"1b, 1d, 1e"
C03166,COVID-19 pandemic guidelines for mental health support of racialized women at risk of gender-based violence,"Gender-based violence (GBV) affects 30-60% of women, impacting their mental, physical, and sexual health. Violence against women contributes to high levels of morbidity and mortality. It is associated with life-long mental health impacts including anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders. Studies report higher rates of past suicide attempts and social exclusion and isolation. Global statistics reveal a drastic increase in violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Fear, uncertainties and stressors among the population during the pandemic contribute to anger and aggression against spouses and partners. Worldwide warnings (including Canada) are raised on the increasing domestic violence during the crisis.   Growing evidence also shows that racialized groups are especially at higher risk of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.   Our project's overall goal is to advance trauma-informed mental health care for racialized women at risk of GBV during the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery phases.   We will conduct a rapid review to assess the state of knowledge on mental health among women exposed to GBV during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify best practices for detection, referral, and service provision for mental health promotion and care. We will adapt the Cochrane Rapid Reviews method, and will be guided by an equity lens in conducting rapid reviews on public health issues. We will engage in gender-specific knowledge exchange with different sectors.   Our project's outcomes will be: a Rapid Review of synthesised findings, an Information Brief, an Infographic, and a Toolkit.  We will also prepare a Peer-review Article and a Policy brief. Finally, we will develop emerging Guidelines to assist racialized women at risk of GBV and service providers on mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.",10,10a
C15296,Experimental and natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human pancreas,"ABSTRACT  The possibility that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may trigger diabetes emerged as a concern in mid 2020. We have  addressed this issue by developing a research roadmap that identified complementary areas of investigation according  to several broad topics in the realm of relevant basic biomedical research. Based on our recent publication about the  expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the non-diabetic human pancreas, we have now developed a Research  Strategy that will assess the principal capacity of pancreatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and its primary consequences in a  series of in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies distributed across three Specific Aims:  In Aim 1 we will define expression patterns of ACE2 and other viral entry factors in dispersed human pancreatic cell  populations; will subject islets to in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection and quantify infection patterns as well as alterations of  single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes by flow cytometry, high-dimensional mass cytometry, and scRNAseq; will  determine functional islet responses under conditions of viral infection by dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion;  will conduct mechanistic studies with targeted ACE2 blockade and by generation of ACE2-deficient beta-like cells; and  will explore SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of living pancreas slices that provide a more ""physiological""  experimental platform for in vitro studies. In Aim 2, we will use the robust ""minimal mass"" model of human islet  transplantation into immunodeficient mice to delineate metabolic perturbations (blood glucose values, plasma insulin,  intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test) accrued in the wake of an in vivo SARS-CoV-2 challenge. To address the  considerable experimental and logistical challenges in these studies, we have developed a tiered approach that  progressively refines experimental designs (including use of a recently generated, sequenced and characterized  mouse-adapted [ma] SARS-CoV-2 strain) with the goal to imbue our models with escalating biological relevance. In  Aim 3, we will draw on our access to COVID-19 and control autopsy cases to reveal the ex vivo viral burden of natural  SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pancreas. These studies, which build on recently published pilot data as well as extensive  preparatory studies to adjust our staining protocols to the demands of at times suboptimal tissue quality, will define  SARS-CoV-2 protein and mRNA abundance, cellular association and distribution patterns across the COVID-19  pancreas. We will further leverage an established immunohistochemical multiplexing strategy to define the identity,  quantity and distribution of major immune cell subsets throughout COVID-19 and control pancreata. Thus, the proposed  work will generate an inclusive perspective on the cardinal viral and immunological components of the potentially  altered pancreatic histology in COVID-19.  Collectively, the proposed work addresses, and is expected to resolve at least in part, key aspects of the hypothesis  that SARS-CoV-2 infection may precipitate diabetes onset. Together with emerging epidemiological data, it may  therefore provide an important foundation for future risk assessment and the prioritization of prophylactic and/or  therapeutic intervention strategies.",4,"4a, 4b"

C01835,Africa CDC Response to COVID-19,"The African Union, Africa CDC, in collaboration with WHO on Febraury 22nd, 2020 convened an emergency meeting of all 55 ministers of health to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of the meeting, they agreed on a continent-wide strategy for COVID-19 that will allow for greater coordination, collaboration, cooperation and communication. The strategy focuses on six major technical areas and is implemented through and endorsed Africa Coronavirus Task Force (AFCOR). As of 15 March 2020, over 26 countries have reported greater than 250 cases. In Africa, the primary strategy for COVID-19, therefore, is based on limiting transmission and minimizing harm. Delaying and diminishing the peak of outbreaks can help health systems better manage the surge of patients and communities better adapt to the disruption of social, cultural, and economic activities. In order to compliment WHO's efforts to respond to COVID-19, Africa CDC is uniquely positioned to support Member States through its presence within the African Union, the highest political body in Africa, and its five Regional Collaborating Centers.

We propose to develop an in vitro model of human lung infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection for initial screening and in depth validation of hits. Our laboratories possess strong virological expertise, including direct work with SARS-CoV-2. We have established cultures of human respiratory epithelial cells in monolayers or in 3D models of culture at air/liquid interfaces. The SME partner has established a technology for the development of immortalized cell lines and has been expanding stocks of cells from upper and lower parts of the respiratory system.

P23247,"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data","Project Abstract/Summary  Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus  outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by  combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The  dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from  atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to  achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working  with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools  to support preparedness plans and decision-making.  Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and  signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within  seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data  covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim  2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and  chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates  and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from  millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and  EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses  that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other  surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy,  sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access  Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models.  This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high  spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance  systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these  algorithms to other US cities.",3,3d
P23510,"One Health approach to understand, predict and prevent viral emergencies from bats","In recent years, several novel RNA viruses found in bats have been associated to the emergence of human diseases. Surveillance in this extremely diverse group of mammals has revealed that bats are significant reservoir hosts for many viruses whose zoonotic potential deserves further insights. OneBAT aims at investigating the trigger for viral spillover from European bats to humans or domestic animals, using a multidisciplinary consortium of ecologists, virologists and modellers. In response to the outcomes foreseen by the call, OneBAT will unravel the complex interplay between natural and spillover host, pathogen and environment that determines the emergence of infectious diseases. Information on viral replication pathways, antigenic markers, and in vitro and in vivo screening of antivirals will advance the availability of current and future therapeutic and prophylactic tools for Disease X.  Due to technical and logistical reasons, OneBAT will not investigate all the bat species and pathogens circulating in Europe; it will rather provide well-based evidence on relevant model species that could be used to study other bat species or viruses that already are or may become of interest over the lifetime of the project or in the future. We will focus on the Miniopterus schreibersii bats, a species in significant decline across Europe, and on filoviruses, coronaviruses and lyssaviruses, as high-consequence pathogens known to circulate in the target bat. In addition to the specific information stemming from the project, OneBAT will establish a methodological platform that will make available the developed ecological and virological tools. Among them, innovative protocols for serological and virological investigations of these small-seize animals; harmonised longitudinal surveys across Europe, including tracking systems. Ultimately, OneBAT will equip southern and eastern EU countries with 20 VHF receivers that could be used for further studies on all flying animals.",2,"2a, 2b"
P23476,"Novel, orally available immune modulator MP1032 with anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-cytokine activity","The current global COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe health and socio-economic challenges. Despite significant improvements in the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients and advances in vaccine development, there is still an urgent need for safe and effective early-intervention treatments. To reduce disease burden, hospitalization time, and mortality, it is of critical importance to halt disease progression in early (mild-to-moderate) stages.      Our new drug, MP1032, has a dual mode of action, targeting two important mechanisms (immune system overactivation and viral replication) in the early development of COVID-19. Its unique mechanism of self-regulation prevents immune-suppression, which is critical for early intervention. In combination with the oral availability, favourable safety profile, rapid and affordable production scale-up, and potential to work against viral variants, MP1032 is the ideal candidate for early treatment of COVID-19, which can also be used safely in high-risk patients. Therefore, the iMPact project aims to clinically validate MP1032 in a Phase II trial for its ability to stop COVID-19 disease progression. The outcome of the project shall serve as a basis for follow-up rapid Phase IIb/III development and market registration.      Four international SME'Äôs will work together in the iMPact project to achieve the objectives: 1) To demonstrate the efficacy of MP-1032 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2) To demonstrate the effect of MP1032 on current SARS-CoV-2 variants, 3) To develop a GMP-compliant production scale-up process for MP1032, 4) To ensure that the clinical development plan is in line with regulatory requirements and 5) To collaborate with existing EU research networks. We have 29 clinical sites on board, and the required expertise for upscaling GMP manufacturing and regulatory preparation is available, ensuring that, by October 2022, MP1032 will be ready to progress to Phase IIb/III trials.",6,6d
C19858,To assess the impact of COVID-19 on prenatal education and pregnancy outcomes in mothers and children in remote First Nations communities in Manitoba,"COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected the prenatal education for pregnant women and potentially has long lasting adverse effects on the pregnancy outcome and health of mothers and their children. First Nations (FN) pregnant women and children  particularly those living in remote communities, may be more severely affected. We propose to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the interruption of prenatal education and resultant consequences including GDM, cesarean section, infant growth and breastfeeding initiation in FN women and their offspring in Manitoba via a database study, and on prenatal education, food intake, physical activities, spousal support, breastfeeding initiation and duration to pregnant FN women in remote Island Lake communities compared to those in rural FN communities in Manitoba, and FN and non-FN pregnant women and children living in Winnipeg via online or hardcopy survey with the support from regional health authority, communities, health workers and community Elders. The results of the proposed study will demonstrate the negative consequences of COVID-19 on prenatal education, lifestyle, family support, child growth and pregnancy outcomes in FN and non-FN mothers and their children in urban, rural and remote communities. The findings from the project may help to understand and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the health of FN pregnant women and their children to identify the areas in pregnancy and postpartum programs, which are required to be improved in remote and rural FN communities and to protect the health and wellness of Indigenous women, children and their families.",10,"10a, 10b"

P22573,Partnership for Research in Emerginig Viral Infections-Sierra Leone (PREVSL),"Project Summary/ Abstract: The recent Ebola epidemic exposed the fragility of Sierra LeoneÃ'Â´s health system  and highlighted the inadequate investments to date that are needed to support a well-functioning system  capable of responding to a disease outbreak of this magnitude. To improve delivery of quality health services  for patients with endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) such as Lassa fever (LF), while strengthening  capacity to conduct clinical trials during future epidemic VHF outbreaks such as Ebola, Sierra Leone must grow  its pool of qualified health professionals with the methodological skills in implementation science and the  conduct of clinical trials.  We have just completed a Planning Grant for Emerging Epidemic Virus Research Training for West African  Countries with Widespread Transmission of Ebola- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (D71TW010411), that  has allowed us to evaluate existing research capacity of our in-country partner organizations, while refining our  strategies for best approaches to address gaps in that capacity. Combining this with our extensive knowledge  and history of conducting VHF research in Sierra Leone; as well as nearly two-decades managing institutional  research, training, and capacity-building grants; we propose here our comprehensive research training plan  in response to PAR-18-840-Global Infectious Disease Research Training.

C09566,Detection and Automatic Privacy-Protected Contact Tracing System Designed for COVID-19,"Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, bringing death, illness, disruption to dailylife, and economic crisis to businesses and individuals. The situation has been exacerbated after the schoolsand companies reopened due to economic pressure. One of the key failures in COVID-19 containment isunderlined by the inability of our healthcare system in real-time detection in point-of-care (POC) and end-usersettings and precise tracing with privacy protection of active infections. The fundamental limitations of currentgene-based assays stem from their reliance upon amplification and detection of the viral genetic materialseven if there were no intact/infectious viruses. These tests require labor-intensive, laboratory-based samplepreparation protocols for virus lysis, extraction of genetic materials, purification of the isolated materials,thermal cycling for enzymatic amplification of viral nucleic acid sequences, and interpretation of complexresults by professionals. To accurately determine the infectivity of the infected individuals, contaminatedobjects and environments, and provide guidance for patients, public and authorities to better manage treatmentand containment, we seek a new paradigm for rapid and direct pathogen detection and identification in whichthe intact virions are directly recognized through their distinct surface epitope features, and the resultantfluorescent signal is immediately captured by an end-user smartphone, followed by automatic data transitionand event tracing in a blockchain-encrypted manner. To achieve specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 virions,we customized a designer DNA nanostructure (DDN)-based capture probe that harbors a macromolecular""net"" whose vertices precisely match the intra- and inter-spatial pattern of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spikeglycoprotein clusters, and integrates a net-shaped array of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific-targeting aptamers.This aptamer-DDN is designed for maximum affinity and specificity binding with spikes on intact virions in apolyvalent and pattern-matching fashion. Once bound to intact virions, the DNA ""nets"" trigger the release offluorescence. This fluorescent signal can be readily and automatically detected by a membrane-shaped andsmartphone-based fluorimeter attached to the end-users' phone cameras. The acquired results will beassociated with user device IDs that are cyber-protected before tracing. We propose to combine DDN captureprobes and a smartphone device to develop and demonstrate a rapid, room temperature, single-step, virus-specific, and ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which the detection results can be acquiredwithin 5 minutes upon exposure, at the user end, allowing tracing the presence of viruses without affecting userprivacy. The signal to result transition, result to ID association, individual track and interacting network tracingwill be blockchain-encrypted to ensure information security for individual privacy, while tracing informationwould be available to health authority for public health benefits.",1,1a
P21450,Fast DNA Sequencing Using Near-field Microwave Sensors,"DNA is the nucleic acid that passes information from parent to child in living systems. Determining the order of the four information-carrying bases, (denoted A,C,G,T) is known as ""sequencing"". Such sequencing is at the core of modern molecular biology and genetic epidemiology and has huge potential for applications in diagnosis and precision medicine. Since the pioneering work that led to the first sequencing of the human genome about 20 years ago, sequencing technology has made enormous progress, significantly reducing time and complexity. Portable sequencing devices are now commercially available and have been fundamental, for example, for field-surveillance of Ebola virus in West Africa and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) variants.    These portable devices are based on the motion of dissolved ions (charged atoms) through a tiny hole called a ""nanopore"", whose dimensions are in the order of a few nanometers, i.e. billionths of a metre. If DNA strands are present, they can also be made to flow through the pore, temporarily blocking the flow of ions. Each of the four bases forming the DNA modifies the ion flow in a slightly different way and therefore, by monitoring how the flow of ions changes over time it is possible to determine the sequence of the bases within the DNA. Nanopore sequencing is revolutionising the way we sequence DNA, but suffers from some limitations which are fundamentally linked to the ion current approach. In particular, although DNA can pass through the pore at a high speed (~1 million bases per second) it is not possible to monitor the motion of ions this quickly and therefore it is not possible to read the sequence in real time. Instead complex enzyme-based mechanisms must be used to slow down the DNA transit.    In this project, we hope to achieve a transformative change in real-time sequencing rates by combining solid-state nanopores with a new way of identifying the four bases within DNA strands. To do so, we will use microwaves - electromagnetic waves oscillating at GHz frequencies. Microwaves are at the core of the information and communication technologies used in mobile phones, wi-fi and Bluetooth networks and GPS satellites to carry large amounts of information. Microwaves also interact with matter and can be used to probe molecules by measuring their unique electromagnetic fingerprints.     Our proposed sensors will combine atomically-precise nanofabrication with the measurement accuracy offered by high frequency electronics. The device will consist of an atomically-thin conductor (graphene) shaped as a bowtie with a small gap at its centre. The conductor acts as a waveguide, enabling microwave propagation between the two ends of the sensor. The centre of the bowtie will be carefully aligned with a nanopore, so that, when DNA passes through the pore, it interacts with the electromagnetic field formed at the bowtie tips. We hope that each of the four bases forming the DNA (A, C, G and T) will cause different transmission and reflection of the propagating microwaves, allowing the sequence of bases to be read. This approach replaces the slow, ion-motion based electrochemistry currently used for nanopore sensing with fast communication-engineering technologies, with potential for a 1000-fold increase in speed.    The sensor technology developed will have capabilities beyond sequencing, as it can be applied to analyse other molecules relevant for biochemistry and medicine. Thanks to the compatibility of our sensors with electronic chip fabrication technology and the ubiquitous use of microwave electronics for wireless communication, we envisage a seamless integration with already existing technology to realise portable sequencing and sensing tools.",1,1c
C06690,Rapid Hit Generation and Lead Elaboration for SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics,"The novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic has taken a strong foothold and itis estimated that it will infect hundreds of millions of people, with millions dying. These estimatesunderscore the severity of the COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, yet there are currentlyno effective treatments that can be administered to infected individuals. Our approach centeredaround a proprietary structure-based drug discovery engine, which combines rapid screening ofa molecular fragment library in a fragment-based drug discovery approach with high-throughputX-ray crystallography. We will discover and develop novel small molecule inhibitors of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein S1 subunit (attachment inhibitors),inhibitors of the viral spike protein S2 subunit (fusion inhibitors), and the Nsp14-Nsp10 complex(replication mismatch repair inhibitors). Our approach resolves an important step in early drugdiscovery, i.e., the generation of reliable, high-quality, target-specific hits that can be advanced totherapeutics development. Our method provides experimental validation and unprecedentedability to visualize 3D protein-ligand interactions in a single step, delivering valuable actionableassets (identification and definition of binding sites and binding pose) for immediate chemistryand biology follow up in early drug discovery. Our goal is to target conserved amino acid residueswithin these proteins to discover and advance molecules that may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2proteins and also serve as pan-coronavirus inhibitors. Thus we will create broad-spectrumantiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains and against the homologous proteins inSARS and MERS, thereby effectively creating treatments for both current and future coronavirusoutbreaks. We will determine X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S2 and Nsp14-Nsp10 proteins bound to molecular fragments and elaborate these fragment hits into inhibitorsthrough a combination of computational and medicinal chemistry, high-throughput structuralbiology, and biophysical assays.",6,6a
C09368,Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in immune-suppressed patients: increased risk of insufficient immunological memory or sufficient protection against re-infection - a Target to B! substudy,"In general, vaccine responses are variably reduced in a large group of patients with autoimmune diseases (AID), mostly depending on the type and dose of the used immunosuppressive treatment (s).    Currently, there is the pressing question whether vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is less effective in these patients with immunosuppression (ISP). The main objective of this vaccination study is to elucidate whether the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2-targeted vaccination is reduced in ISP compared to patients with AID without immunosuppressive drugs or healthy individuals, and whether the persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity differs over time because of ISP. To get much better informed and prepared regarding current vaccination strategies, we will use the unique platform of our T2B consortium, a well-established close collaboration and infrastructure of 6 different academic hospitals, Reade, RIVM and Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation.         Building on several clinical studies already initiated at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by our clinical T2B partners, we will perform in-depth analysis of the humoral and cellular vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In one of our previous prospective observational studies we focus on the longevity of the immune response in ISP after primoinfection and the role of this previous infection in the early vaccine response.    In the current vaccination study in AID, we will collect longitudinal clinical data and samples from selected 3000 patients treated with frequently prescribed immunosuppressive drugs representing distinct categories within the wide spectrum of immunosuppression to determine vaccination efficacy in ISP. Humoral response in ISP upon vaccination will be compared to the humoral response in 1000 patients diagnosed with similar AID but without immunosuppression as well as to the response in healthy controls. In addition, we will determine the safety of vaccination and changes in disease activity of the underlying AID after vaccination (disease flaring), by comparing to a separate control group of 1000 patients with similar AID that are not willing to be vaccinated.

C07420,Improved face-worn PPE designs for use by the public and professionals to reduce audio-visual communication difficulties,"To reduce the transmission of COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE) is  required. PPE to protect the eyes, nose and mouth comprises face masks and transparent  visors. These range from a simple covering made from domestic fabrics for use by the  public, to FFP3/N99 rated air filters and wrap-around face visors in care settings. All these  PPE styles make spoken and signed communication harder. Everyone, not just the  hearing impaired, will struggle to understand in real-world conditions and background  sounds. This will result in increased listening effort, stress, communication errors and  potentially social withdrawal. Articles published in May 2020 by the PI and his group  leader in a professional journal  (https://www.entandaudiologynews.com/features/audiology-features/post/the-challenges-  of-facemasks-for-people-with-hearing-loss) produced over 100 responses from anxious  adults, parents, public and professionals.  Both acoustic and visual cues are reduced by face coverings: (i) acoustic : the high frequencies of  the sound are attenuated, leading to a ""muffled"" perception (ii) visual : sight of the talker's mouth  movements that can be used by all listeners to supplement the muffling of speech and (iii) visual :  full-facial expressions that convey emotions, supplement lip-reading and are essential  components of (the non-acoustic) British Sign Language (BSL).  Employing user surveys, fabrication, and testing, this project will produce validated examples of  facemask and visor designs that preserve acoustic and visual cues thereby offering less effortful  communication in a variety of usage scenarios. It brings together acousticians, audiologists,  material scientists, and users to tackle an urgent problem that affects everyone now, and will also  outlast the current pandemic.",5,5b

C00899,"Ebola modeling: behavior, asymptomatic infection, and contacts (2019-nCoV Admin Supplement)","We propose to use statistical methods we have used for Ebola virus disease forecasting in order toproject COVID-19 transmission at the state and municipal level, producing testable forecasts. Thesewill feature continuously updated estimates of the reproduction number (number of cases per case)and permit us to assess the benefits of current interventions (social distancing, school closure). We also propose to conduct a close analysis of the fraction of cases traceable to known cases.This statistic can be useful because it can indicate transmission through unknown routes or throughasymptomatic cases, but it can also be influenced by the efficacy of contact tracing itself. Manycases that would have otherwise occurred are caught and prevented by contact tracing and isolation.We will conduct network simulations to determine when large values of this presage epidemic growth(depending on the reproduction number, and timeliness and yield of contact investigation). Finally, we will use detailed network simulation to yield a pandemic preparation road maplooking into the future. Specifically, specific events (rate of increase of cases, large number ofuntraceable cases, cases in varying geographic areas) will yield specific actions (school closures,mass gathering abrogation) despite uncertainty in the mode of transmission. These detailed modelswill also be used for real time assessment of the timing and duration of school closure.","1, 3","1b, 1e,3a"

C06212,"Spectrum, determinants and long term outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection and disease in African children.","Children in LMICs experience a very high burden of pneumonia, which continues to be the major single killer of children under five years of age. Risk factors such as malnutrition, pollution, crowded living conditions and the high burden of infectious diseases all contribute to the vulnerability of children to developing severe pneumonia in these settings. However, surprisingly children in LMICs and globally are only mildly affected by COVID-19, with very few severe cases or deaths occurring in young children. This project will investigate what factors protect children against developing infection or severe disease from COVID-19 across LMICs and whether prior infection with other organisms, including seasonal coronaviruses, protects children against severe disease through development of immunity. This project will provide new information on COVID-19 in childhood, protective factors, immune responses and the long term impact on child health.    ""This funding provides a wonderful opportunity to better understand COVID-19 in African children in a low and middle income country context.

Policymakers have emphasised the need for a whole population approach to studying mental health during pandemics but no such study has yet been conducted. With initial funding from the Universities of Sheffield and Ulster, early in the crisis we began collecting longitudinal data from a sample of 2,025 UK adults that is representative of the population in age, sex, household income, etc., measuring anxiety, depression, health behaviours, political beliefs and other relevant variables using standardised measures.

C07245,Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance Use in a YMSM Cohort,"Abstract: Critical and urgent COVID-19 research questions will be addressed by characterizing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and symptom profile in a racially diverse cohort of substance-using YMSM at baseline and again 6 months later using a home-collected, quantitative assay for antibodies expected to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro.     The following are the specific aims:  (1) Characterize socio-behavioral risks of COVID-19 by testing hypotheses that:  a. At time of wave 1 testing in summer 2020, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and symptom rates will be higher among Black and Latinx than White participants. Subsequent seroconversion will also be greater among Black and Latinx substance-using YMSM RADAR participants.  b. Substance use will be associated with increased seroprevalence and symptoms. Specifically, utilization of combustible or vaporized nicotine or cannabis products, as well as methamphetamine, will increase prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Use of these substances will also predict seroconversion over subsequent follow-up.  c. Participants who report sharing of drug smoking/vaporizing paraphernalia since March 2020 will have an increased seroprevalence, over-and-above the effect of use alone, due to additional transmission risk from contact. Sharing paraphernalia at wave 1 will also predict seroconversion over subsequent follow-up.    (2) Understand COVID-19 risks associated with systemic inflammation, HIV-associated factors, and declining anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by testing hypotheses that:  a. Systemic inflammation is associated with increased sero-prevalence/-conversion and symptoms.  b. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence may differ between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants, or with antiretroviral use as PrEP or treatment (ART), after controlling for systemic inflammation.  c. Lower CD4 cell count (in people living with HIV) is associated with decreased anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG quantity and/or duration.  d. Lower quantity and/or loss of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD IgG is associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (a second, separate episode of PCR positivity in a subsequent peak of cases).","1, 3, 4","1d, 3a, 3b, 4a"
P21747,Engineering pathogen triggered biomineralization to enable a new generation of point-of-care tests,"ABSTRACT  Biomineralization is a coalescence of organic (soft) and inorganic (hard) chemistries where proteins or  peptides borne on a close-knit macromolecular scaffold serve as nucleation sites for salts to precipitate from  solution and grow into crystals. When these proteins or peptide motifs are free in solution phase at low  concentrations, biomineralization does not occur. We aim to harness this concentration dependent  phenomenon to formulate a new generation of pathogen specific assays. Biomineralizing motifs will be fused  to antibodies specific to macromolecular scaffolds of pathogens, so that the presence of pathogen will cluster  the fusions, concentrating them to trigger crystal formation. The approach requires no washing steps and  should give a visible readout in this feasibility study for an exploratory point-of-care assay. We will first isolate  protein motifs capable of driving the formation of physiological buffer salt crystals from solutions. We will then  employ Filovirus preparations and pre-existing antibodies against polyvalent viral cores to assess  biomineralization potential of motif-antibody fusions and establish limits of detection (LOD) for Ebola and  Marburg viruses to benchmark our system. Finally, we will engineer mutants of the motifs to understand  drivers of biomineralization, accelerating the process, reducing assay times and lowering LOD. While initially  meant as a point-of-care assay feasibility study, the process should also be addressable by conductivity  measurements and imaging for biosensing applications. If successful, future developments could also include  retuning the process to operate against adjacent nucleic acid sequence targets by fusing the biomineralizing  motifs to oligonucleotide probes. Convenient and inexpensive diagnostics that donÃ¢Â€Â™t require vast infrastructure  investment are desperately needed in the field, especially for emerging zoonoses in resource limited  geographies. Our feasibility study will show whether biomineralization can contribute to solving this problem  and offer a paradigm shifting parallel track for further development to help safeguard human health.",1,1a

C10724,Repurposing an FDA-approved anti-gout drug for the treatment of COVID-19,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has posed an unprecedented health and economic threat worldwide. Despite the intense research since its outbreak, there is currently no effective treatment or vaccine for this disease. This project focuses on the development of a novel therapeutic for COVID-19 by drug repositioning. Probenecid, under the brand name Probalan, is a medication that is primarily used in treating gout by increasing uric acid excretion in the urine. We have recently made exciting observations that probenecid potently inhibits infection of two different but related families of RNA viruses, i.e., corona- and entero- viruses. Moreover, unlike some anti-viral drugs that may cause severe cardiotoxicity, probenecid actually reduces cardiovascular risks associated with decreased inflammatory response. Based on these preliminary data and the proven anti-inflammatory role of Probenecid, we postulate that Probenecid is a very attractive drug candidate for COVID-19 treatment by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication and alleviating disease-associated systemic and lung inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we propose two aims: (1) evaluate the potential of repurposing Probenecid for COVID-19 treatment using cell and mouse models; and (2) define the underlying anti-viral mechanism of Probenecid. If successful, the significance of this study and the follow-up clinical trial will be huge for patients with COVID-19.",6,6a

C15234,Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19,"Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both ""neutralizing"" and nonneutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts.

C06348,Evaluation of amphiregulin as a prognostic biomarker of severity and its participation in the pathophysiology of COVID-19,"The latest threat to global health is the ongoing outbreak of the respiratory disease that has been named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the virus called SARS-CoV-2. Although scientists in basic and clinical areas worldwide are making great efforts to understand the pathophysiology and investigating the effect of drugs with antiviral action and the repositioning of drugs that have anti-inflammatory action, there is still no specific drug or effective clinical treatment. for COVID-19. However, it is known that progressive respiratory failure caused by massive damage to alveolar cells, resulting from viral replication and excessive local inflammation, is one of the major obstacles to the recovery of critically ill patients with COVID-19. In this sense, the host's defense against infections depends not only on the mechanisms of immune resistance, but also on the body's ability to tolerate the damage that a given pathogen promotes. Amphiregulin (AREG) is a central factor that promotes repair and restoration of tissue integrity after tissue damage associated with inflammation. AREG-deficient animals have a substantial impairment of the ability to restore lung function in infection models. In addition, the administration of recombinant AREG enhances the tissue repair process after tissue injury resulting from excessive inflation. Our working hypothesis is that AREG plays a key role in repairing and restoring the integrity of lung tissue during COVID-19 and that treatment with recombinant AREG shortens patients' recovery period. In addition, we work with the hypothesis that the determination of AREG levels in patients still in moderate form can be an important prognostic biomarker of severity in patients. Thus, we propose in the present project to conduct a translational study to investigate the participation of AREG in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, using animal models of experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection and samples from patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, we intend to assess the potential of AREG as a prognostic biomarker of severity in patients with COVID-19.","1, 4","1b, 4a, 4b"
C07149,Reward Re-Training: A new treatment to address reward imbalance during the COVID-19 pandemic,"PROJECT SUMMARYPublic health approaches to reducing the spread of COVID-19 such as social distancing, shelter-in-placeorders, quarantine, telework, and remote learning have produced a sudden and widespread disruption to social networks. The observed disruptions to social networks are leading to increases in social isolation and loneliness and limited opportunities to obtain sufficient reward from day-to-day life activities. Reduced exposure to day-to-day sources of reward can lead to a hypo-reward response to conventionally rewarding stimuli and reduce an individual's motivation to engage in activities that they usually find pleasurable. When insufficient pleasure is experienced from day-to-day life activities, some individuals may be more likely to seek out stimuli that can immediately and powerfully activate neural reward pathways. A hyper-reward response to disorder specific stimuli may develop as individuals seek out larger quantities or more frequent exposure to a limited range ofintensely stimulating sources of reward. Collectively, this may produce a reward imbalance such that individuals achieve very little reward from typically enjoyable day-to-day life activities and instead achieve most of their reward from behaviors or substances that have high potential for adverse consequences. While the reward imbalance is likely a relevant maintenance factor for numerous mental health conditions, there is a strong body of literature suggesting that individuals with an eating disorders (ED) characterized predominately by binge eating experience a reward imbalance.    Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team began to develop a novel group-based treatment approach for transdiagnostic binge eating that we call Reward Re-Training (RRT). RRT is designed to indirectly change disordered eating behaviors by directly focusing on building a more rewarding life. RRT hypothesizes that reductions in binge eating will occur as life becomes more rewarding because individuals will no longer need to rely on binge eating as a primary source of momentary reward. RRT notes that in order to live a satisfying life, individuals need to experience an adequate amount of reward in two overlapping yet distinguishable domains:momentary reward (i.e., the active experience of pleasure in the moment) and sustained reward (i.e., a deeper and more long-lasting sense of fulfillment and meaning that arises from building a personally valued life). A keyaspect of RRT is an emphasize on building lasting and meaningful social relationships given the clear evidence that social activities and social connection can enhance both momentary reward and sustained reward. In the current study, we will revise our existing 10-session group RRT treatment manual to specifically address the challenges in enhancing both momentary and sustained reward during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will conduct a small pilot RCT that will randomize individuals to receive either 10-sessions of RRT (n=30) orsupportive therapy (n=30), both delivered as group-treatments via videoconferencing software, to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, target engagement and preliminary estimates of efficacy for RRT.",10,"10a, 10b"

C00117,"Host cellular protein substrates of SARS-CoV-2 proteases [Added supplements: Sex as biological variable supplement, COVID-19 Variant Supplement]","The recent outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-2020) leading to COVID-19 disease in China and worldwide has led to increased urgency in identifying strategies to mitigate the spread of coronavirus infection and treat infected individuals. No established treatments exist, thus there is a need to identify antiviral targets. As evidenced of recurring SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2012) outbreaks, there is also a need for long-term preparations to counteract future emerging coronavirus outbreaks. Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to COVID-19 and related SARS/MERS-CoV diseases are not understood. In this study, we will identify the host proteins that are targeted by a viral protein called a protease using an unbiased proteomics approach. Identifying the protein targets of SARS/MERS-CoV proteases will reveal into the protein sequence that binds to the proteases. We will engineer and optimize decoy protein sequences that will effectively block SARS/MERS-CoV protease function and thus, inhibit SARS/MERS-CoV infection. Uncovering the proteins that are targeted by the SARS/MERS-CoV proteases will also provide a catalog of the host processes that these viruses affect, thus gaining insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to COVID-19 disease.",6,6a
P22327,Evaluating risks of ZIKV co-infection in SIV-infected macaques,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Over 36 million people are living with HIV and there is large geographic overlap for areas endemic with flavivirus  infection. Despite the occurrence of large flavivirus outbreaks, there is a severe lack of knowledge regarding the  impact flavivirus infections may have on people living with HIV (PLWH). It is unclear what effect HIV co-infection  has on the clinical consequences of flavivirus infection and current studies in humans are limited by low patient  numbers and inconsistent incorporation of HIV disease status into interpretations of flavivirus disease. Non-  human (NHP) models of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection recapitulate several aspects of human disease and are ideal  for evaluating the impact of human flavivirus infection in people living with HIV. However, no established HIV-  ZIKV co-infection animal model exists. In this proposal, we will study the natural history of HIV co-infection with  flaviviruses to understand the risks, causes, and clinical outcomes in PLWH. Previously in NHPs, we showed  that CD16+ monocytes are the major in vivo blood targets of ZIKV and similar results have been found in humans.  Monocyte frequencies increase during HIV infection and although ART reduces total frequencies in HIV infected  persons, CD16+ monocytes remain elevated. We will investigate the hypothesis that HIV infection promotes  susceptibility to flavivirus infection by decreasing anti-viral innate and adaptive immune responses, increasing  inflammation, and expanding cellular targets of infection, including monocytes. HIV invasion of the central  nervous system (CNS) is mediated by CD16+ monocytes, therefore monocytes could also act to spread ZIKV to  the CNS and promote neurological disease. Thus, HIV infection could promote ZIKV pathogenesis and  neuroinvasion by expanding the cellular target pool and inducing inflammation. Additionally, we hypothesize that  enhanced ZIKV pathogenesis occurs in PLWH, and we will experimentally test this using an NHP model of SIV  infection. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will evaluate whether cells from SIV infected animals support greater ZIKV  replication. In Aim 2 we will determine whether ZIKV pathogenesis is enhanced in SIV-infected macaques. We  will determine whether SIV infection promotes invasion of ZIKV into the CNS and determine the innate and  adaptive immune responses corresponding to enhanced infection. These studies will provide significant insights  into the potential risk of enhanced ZIKV pathogenesis in the HIV population and determine if PLWH have a  greater risk of ZIKV-associated pathologies. The goal of this K01 is to support the transition of developing my  own independent research program focused on understanding the impact of viral co-infections in PLWH. In order  to achieve this goal I will expand upon my previous training using NHP models of HIV and ZIKV human infection,  will leverage the resources at the University of Washington and the Washington National Primate Research  Center, and will work closely with my mentors, Dr. Deborah Fuller and Dr. Michael Gale.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"
P23136,Leadership Group for the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRCLG) - Moderna Boost {Supplement #5},"IDCRC LG Project Summary/Abstract:  This Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium Leadership Group (IDCRCLG or LG) is a  collaborative national partnership of leading infectious diseases, human immunology and clinical research  experts from eight outstanding academic institutions providing experience, guidance, global connectivity and  innovative approaches to address NIH/NIAID clinical research priorities. The emphasis (and strength) of the  LG is to facilitate, plan and help implement clinical research for respiratory and enteric infections,  malaria/tropical diseases, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and to respond to emerging infectious  diseases (EID). Priority research will include interventional trials and clinical research studies for vaccines,  biologics, therapeutics, diagnostics and devices targeting these infectious diseases. The LG's experts and  their programs at the eight universities and beyond have a historic record of accomplishment in vaccine  and therapeutic clinical research, and immunologic and pathogenesis studies for these NIAID-priority  infectious diseases. The LG brings extensive expertise with the conduct of Phase I-IV clinical trials including first-  in-human studies, cutting-edge human immunology, pharmacokinetics; engagement with diverse populations  both nationally/internationally, sIRBs, innovative public-private partnerships, and Investigational New Drug  applications (INDs). The group also has strong connectivity to and will leverage NIH/NIAID-supported networks;  extensive experience in collaborating with industry partners and foundations, and leadership of complex  administrative consortia. This cadre of diverse infectious diseases experts proposes to establish and operate  with NIAID and the reconstituted Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs), an integrated, highly-  functional, efficient IDCRC to develop innovative scientific and operational strategies in priorities such as  vaccines and STI clinical research. The organizational structure supporting the science and operations of the  LG is composed of a Leadership Operations Center including Expert Working Groups, a Clinical Operations  Unit, a Laboratory Operations Unit, and a Statistical and Data Science Unit. Key functions of the LG are to  propose, review and prioritize innovative concepts; to enhance integration and efficiency in operations; to  form collaborative teams; to ensure quality and timely protocol implementation; to disseminate results; to  promote integration of all populations in IDCRC research across the human lifespan; and to attract, engage  and retain the next generation of scientists in infectious diseases clinical research. In addition, the LG's  experience with EID threats, links to global partners/sites, access to the highest-level clinical and laboratory  containment facilities and to large populations will help the IDCRC to respond rapidly (surge capacity) during  a public health emergency. The LG's decades of experience with public health, regulatory agencies,  product development pipelines further enhance this capacity. The LG and the institutions represented are  committed through dedicated PI/leadership effort, space, infrastructure and direct funds to develop the IDCRC.",13,
P21921,Emerging methods and applications for test-negative studies of of infectious disease interventions,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The need for longitudinal follow-up of individuals exposed to interventions against rare   infectious disease endpoints poses a barrier to prospective efficacy and effectiveness studies.   Studies using the test-negative design (TND) have become a popular alternative. TNDs   represent a variant on traditional case-control designs: studies enroll subjects who seek care for   a clinical syndrome, defining those who test positive and negative for a pathogen of interest as   Ã¢Â€ÂœcasesÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœcontrolsÃ¢Â€Â, respectively. To facilitate rigorous and reproducible assessments of   vaccine performance, the project will re-assess emerging applications of the TND, and   contribute methods to measure intervention effects from data collected by TND studies.   The first two aims revisit estimation strategies for vaccine-conferred protection against infection   and against the progression of infection to diseaseÃ¢Â€Â""the two components of the vaccine Ã¢Â€Âœdirect   effectÃ¢Â€Â that TND studies aim to measure. We propose novel frameworks to estimate each effect   through extensions of the TND: one through comparisons of symptomatic and asymptomatic   persons, and another leveraging the age distribution of cases. We will apply these methods to   estimate pneumococcal conjugate vaccine effectiveness against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal   pneumonia and carriage, and to re-assess reported differences in rotavirus vaccine effectiveness   across high, middle, and low-income countries.   In Aim 3, we will continue development of statistical procedures for cluster randomized test-   negative designs. A major field trial of this nature for a vector intervention utilizing the   bacterium Wolbachia to reduce dengue fever transmission is nearing completion. Permutation-   based inference is planned because of small numbers of clusters. We will extend such methods   (i) to allow for individual measures of intervention exposure (based on human and mosquito   mobility), and (ii) to include design variants such as the stepped wedge design and interrupted   time series where data collection has either recently ended or is in process. We will also consider   a novel application to assess a new vaccine against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the   Democratic Republic of the Congo. This project will thus contribute methods and computational   routines to allow valid inferences from TND study data, permitting novel assessments of   interventions against rotavirus, pneumococcal disease, EVD, and dengue etc.",7,"7i, 7y"
P21492,Study of Nipah virus dynamics and genetics in its bat reservoir and of human exposure to NiV across Bangladesh to understand patterns of human outbreaks,"Project Summary  Nipah virus is a zoonotic paramyxovirus, carried by old world fruit bats across Africa and Asia, which causes  severe, fatal encephalitis in humans and can be transmitted from person to person. In Bangladesh, where  outbreaks in people occur annually, the primary route of transmission is the consumption of raw date palm sap.  Date palm sap is harvested and consumed most intensively in western Bangladesh, an area referred to as the  Ã¢Â€ÂœNipah belt,Ã¢Â€Â however, date palm sap consumption, NiV, and its bat reservoir, Pteropus medius, are present  throughout Bangladesh. It is unclear why outbreaks have not been detected in eastern Bangladesh. Cryptic  spillover of NiV creates a significant risk that more pathogenic and transmissible strains will emerge and lead  to large epidemics. This multidisciplinary project will determine whether NiV outbreaks have occurred in  eastern Bangladesh and how differences human behavior, infection patterns in bats, and genetic variation in  circulating strains of NiV influence outbreaks outside of the Nipah belt. This project combines human exposure  studies with multi-site longitudinal infection studies in bats and in vivo experimental infections in bats and  hamsters comparing clinical outcomes among diverse strains to achieve the following specific aims:   1) To compare NiV exposure and its behavioral determinants among human populations inside and   outside the Nipah belt in Bangladesh. We will test the hypothesis that NiV spillover has occurred in   Bangladesh in communities outside the Nipah belt. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll use behavioral questionnaires and a multiplex   Luminex serological assay to screen high risk populations for IgG antibodies against NiV and determine if   Nipah exposure has occurred and how behavioral risk varies by locality.  2) To compare Nipah virus temporal dynamics in Pteropus bat colonies inside and outside of the   Nipah belt. We will conduct longitudinal bat NiV field studies in six locations (3 western, 3 eastern),   characterize local bat demography, measure changes in seroprevalence over time; determine viral   shedding patterns and genetic variation among strains. Through experimental bat infections in a BSL 4   lab, we will determine whether bats with antibodies against NiV (previous exposure) may be re-infected   and shed virus. This will answer a critical question about transmission dynamics and allow us to test the   hypothesis that viral shedding occurs with different frequency in eastern bats compared to western bats,   which may influence zoonotic transmission.  3) To compare pathogenicity and transmissibility of diverse Nipah virus isolates from bats inside and   outside the Nipah belt, using animal models. Malaysia type NiV and Bangladesh type have different   clinical profiles in people. NiV genetic variation may account for lower human infection rates in eastern   Bangladesh. To test this hypothesis, we will compare transmissibility and pathogenicity of diverse NiV   strains isolated from Pteropus medius in a Syrian hamster model under BSL 4 conditions.","1, 2","1e, 2a"
P22064,Molecular regulatory mechanism of Zika virus-induced intracranial calcifications,"Project Summary/Abstract:   The number of vector-borne disease cases in the US has tripled over the past decade and these  pathogens including mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) remain an apparent threat to general public health. The  ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and Southeast Asia is a major global health concern, largely due to the  association with fetal craniofacial abnormalities and malformations, resulting from prenatal infection. Although  ZIKV infection during pregnancy is casually associated with microcephaly, it is important to note that intracranial  calcification is the most frequent abnormality present in ZIKV-positive babies. In fact, Magnetic Resonance  Imaging study of Brazilian large ZIKV-positive baby cohort reported the intracranial calcifications as the most  common clinical observations. While calcification occurs in soft tissues, the abnormal deposition of calcium in  brain not only severely affects motor function, speech ability, and vision, but also causes seizures. Despite the  growing clinical evidences of ZIKV-induced calcifications and their potential dire outcomes, however, the etiology  and molecular mechanisms of ZIKV-induced brain calcification remain elusive. My preliminary observations in  ZIKV human fetal brain specimens showed that high level of calcium deposits was localized with virus-infected  perivascular cells. Intriguingly, ZIKV-infection of brain perivascular and osteogenic precursor cells robustly  induced calcifications in vitro. Surprisingly, the induction of calcification was lineage-specific to the Asian ZIKV  strains, but not to the African ZIKV strains. African ZIKV strains rapidly replicated, inducing cell death, while Asian  ZIKV strains persistently replicated, leading to aberrant calcium deposition. Surprisingly, ZIKV expression library  screen showed that NS3 protease was sufficient to induce calcification. Based on these preliminary data, I  hypothesize that ZIKV targets specific host brain perivascular cells and utilizes NS3 protease to induce  intracranial calcifications, which ultimately contributes to virus-associated congenital abnormality.  Herein, I seek to address the following questions: (i) which host cells are targeted for ZIKV-induced calcifications,  and (ii and iii) which and how ZIKV NS3 protease triggers abnormal calcification during infection. This proposal  is highly innovative and translational, and potentially shed new insights to ZIKV-induced intracranial calcification  that is the most frequent abnormality present in virus-infected babies.",4,4b

C06366,Global genome screening with CRISPRko libraries to identify essential factors in SARS-COV2 infection and replication,"The present decade begins with a worldwide health emergency, the new coronavirus pandemic, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (COVID-19), also known as SARS-Cov2. To date, there are more than 900,000 positive cases that have resulted in more than 44,000 deaths in 180 countries. In view of these epidemiological data, strategies are needed to contain the transmission of the virus and mainly effective alternatives in the treatment of this disease. In this context, with the project we aim to assess the versatility of using a CRISPRko library to identify critical factors for SARS-Cov2 infection and replication. This library consists of a group of 77,441 guides directed to approximately 19 thousand human genes. This tool will allow us to globally screen the human genome, through CRISPR / Cas9-mediated gene deletion in human lung epithelial cells. After selection against essential genes for cell viability, we submitted the cells to five rounds of lethal infection with human isolate (from Brazil) of a SARS-Cov2 strain. Finally, we will be able to determine genes and pathways involved in viral replication and infection, by sequencing the surviving cells and detecting the guides present in that population. With this high coverage strategy, we believe that we will be able to point out new potential targets for the development of therapies for this disease.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

C15145,Helping Us Grow Stronger (HUGS/Abrazos): COVID-19 in pregnancy and reducing toxic stress in mother-infant dyads,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Pregnancy and early childhood mark a unique period when two lives can be permanently impacted by the  presence of maternal stressors such as economic instability, poor mental health, and social inequities, all of  which have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID pandemic has also collided with the  epidemics of racism and maternal mortality plaguing the United States, to disproportionately impact already-  marginalized Black and Latinx pregnant individuals in the greater Boston area. In the absence of protective  buffers, prolonged exposure to excessive adversity (""toxic stress"") can lead to poor health outcomes for both  mothers and infants. Effective interventions to improve maternal mental health and mitigate social determinants  of health in individuals with COVID-19 in pregnancy are therefore urgently needed.  Helping Us Grow Stronger (HUGS/Abrazos) is a community-based program, designed and launched during the  COVID pandemic. HUGS/Abrazos combines emergency relief, patient navigation, and direct behavioral health  support to foster resilience and mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-related toxic stress on pregnant and  postpartum women and their families. Participants enrolled in Massachusetts General Hospital's COVID-19  Pregnancy Biorepository will be referred to the HUGS/Abrazos program if they test positive for SARS-CoV-2.  Using validated survey instruments, we will assess the extent to which the program improves maternal stress,  anxiety, depression, quality of life, food insecurity, and experiences of racism and discrimination in this high-risk  pregnant population. We will also assess the impact of maternal COVID-19-associated inflammation on  behavioral health outcomes using cytokine analysis of banked serum samples from the participants. This urgent  competitive revision of the R01 ""Fetal Brain-Placental Immune Activation in Maternal Obesity"" is aligned with  the R01's long-term translational goals: to understand how in utero exposure to maternal inflammation and  immune activation impacts fetal programming, in order to create targeted interventions that can improve short-  and long-term maternal and child health outcomes in the face of maternal exposures. This work will generate  key knowledge about the efficacy of a novel community-based intervention to reduce the adverse impact of  maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on the mother-infant dyad, and improve transgenerational outcomes.","4, 10","4c, 10a"
C00383,Language Acts and Worldmaking,"Language Acts and Worldmaking' argues that language is a material and historical force, not a transparent vehicle for thought. Language empowers us, by enabling us to construct our personal, local, transnational and spiritual identities; it can also constrain us, by carrying unexamined ideological baggage. This dialectical process we call 'worldmaking'. If one language gives us a sense of place, of belonging, learning another helps us move across time and place, to encounter and experience other ways of being, other histories, other realities. Thus, our project challenges a widely held view about ML learning. While it is commonly accepted that languages are vital in our globalised world, it is too often assumed that language learning is merely a neutral instrument of globalisation-a commercialised skill set, one of those 'transferable skills' that are part of a humanities education. Yet ML learning is a unique form of cognition and critical engagement. Learning a language means recognising that the terms, concepts, beliefs and practices that are embedded in it possess a history, and that that history is shaped by encounters with other cultures and languages. To regenerate and transform ML we must foreground language's power to shape how we live, and realise the potential of ML learning to open pathways between worlds past and present. Our project realises this potential by breaking down the standard disciplinary approaches that constrain Spanish and Portuguese within the boundaries of national literary and cultural traditions. We promote research that explores the vast multilingual and multicultural terrain constituted by the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds, with their global empires and contact zones in Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Understanding Iberia as both the originator and the product of global colonising movements places Iberian Studies on a comparative, transnational axis and emphasizes diasporic identities, historic postcolonial thinking, modern decolonial movements and transcultural exchange. Our research follows five paths linked by an interest in the movement of peoples and languages across time and place. 'Travelling concepts' researches the stories and vocabularies that construct Iberia as a cultural crossroads, a border between East and West, a homeland for Jews, Muslims and Christians. We examine the ideological work performed by the cultural semantics Iberia, Al-Andalus, and Sefarad in Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, German, Arabic, Hebrew and ladino (Judeo-Spanish), from the Middle Ages to the present, in Europe and beyond. 'Translation acts' turns to the theatrical narrative, investigating how words, as performed speech and embodied language create a world on stage. Through translation, we travel across time and space, interrogating the original words and bringing them to our time and place. This strand exploits theatre's capacity to (re)generate known and imagined worlds. 'Digital Modelling as an act of translation' examines the effects of digital, mobile and networked technology upon our concept of 'global' culture, and what kinds of 'translation' are enacted as information enters and leaves the digital sphere in the context of Hispanic and Lusophone cultures. 'Loaded Meanings and their history' demonstrates the centrality of historical linguistics to cultural understanding, by investigating the process and significance of the learned borrowings in Ibero-Romance. Such borrowings acquire 'loaded' meanings that reflect and shape people's attitudes and worldviews. Finally, the agents of language learning-teachers-are the focus of the fifth strand, 'Diasporic Identities and the Politics of Language Teaching'. Updated with Covid Response - Language barriers prohibit the real understanding of experience in diverse societies and lead to misunderstanding, xenophobia and violence, as we have seen in this country. Language Acts and Worldmaking, led by PI Professor Catherine Boyle, is uniquely placed to offer significant insights into its global narration. Our multidisciplinary team will lead a process of digitally mining sources from, for example, European languages, Mandarin, Korean and Arabic. Linguists working in these languages will engage in translation of the most salient terms and we will use digital tools to compare and analyse the ways in which the pandemic has been narrated. We know from our literary, cultural, linguist and historic research that words like war, conflict, contagion, invasion, fear, sanity and cleansing inhabit the ways in which we articulate our responses - collective and subjective - to moments of crisis. It is important that we have a clear understanding of these articulations at the present moment in an already volatile geopolitical situation.",9,9c

P22235,"Characterization of socioeconomic and land use factors related to Aedes aegypti distribution in Maricopa County, Arizona","Project Summary  Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are primary vectors of dengue, yellow fever, and the newly emerged threats of Zika  and chikungunya viruses. In recent years, mosquito-borne diseases have reemerged as a pressing public health  issue around the world, as the geographic range of mosquitoes has increased rapidly due to expanded global  trade and travel and potentially due to increased temperatures caused by climate change. Maricopa County,  Arizona is potentially at risk for developing Ae. aegypti transmitted diseases due to the established presence of  the mosquito vector and the high volume of travelers coming to Arizona from areas with endemic Ae. aegypti-  borne disease. In fact, on average, over 25 million travelers cross the border from Mexico (an area with diseases  transmitted by the vector) into Arizona each year. Although much research exists on the wide-scale distribution  of mosquito vectors, there is less understanding of the local factors that promote mosquito populations or the  geographic range of the mosquitoes, especially in a desert climate. It is not known whether there are local  socioeconomic or environmental characteristics that support larger Ae. aegypti populations or how mosquitoes  move between local populations. We will use a combination of statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and  phylogenomic analysis to develop a better understanding of the local factors that support mosquito populations  and how mosquito populations are moving over time and space. The long-term goal of this project is to identify  small-scale socioeconomic or landscape characteristics that consistently support Ae. aegypti populations and  implement interventions with the Vector Control Division in Maricopa County, AZ to reduce mosquito  populations, thereby reducing disease transmission risk. The rationale for this application is that the  understanding of the distribution, range, and movement of the mosquito populations is a critical component of  implementing effective public health efforts that can reduce disease burden and cost by aiming to prevent  potential outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease.  Hypothesis: Ae. aegypti will not be uniformly distributed throughout Maricopa County, with some areas  having larger populations due to differences in infrastructure or landscape characteristics (which are related to  neighborhood socioeconomic status) and therefore potential mosquito habitat. Furthermore, we hypothesize  that genetically distinct populations will be separated by short distances and will be unique to specific  neighborhoods.  Aim 1: Characterize the neighborhood socioeconomic factors associated with Ae. aegypti abundance.  Aim 2: Characterize landscape traits, such as greenness, that are associated with Ae. aegypti populations.  Aim 3: Characterize the origin of and migration between local Ae. aegypti mosquito populations within  Maricopa County, Arizona.",2,"2b, 2c"

Whereas the most notorious member, variola virus, is the causative agent of smallpox and was eradicated from natural infection, there are still concerns about a clandestine release during a biological attack. In addition, other members of the family, such as monkeypox virus, have raised concern about epizootic infections that are capable of causing epidemics. For these reasons several poxviruses are listed as Category A priority pathogens by NIH/NIAID. Poxviruses produce two infectious forms, intracellular mature virus (IMV) and extracellular virus (EV). EV are formed by the intracellular envelopment of IMV and are critical for cell-to-cell spread, systemic infection, and pathogenesis. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms employed by orthopoxviruses to envelope, transport, and release infectious EV. Only 9 viral proteins are known to be unique to the EV form. Whereas some functions have be assigned to these 9 proteins, none of them have been shown to be a matrix- like protein and make a direct connection with the IMV form of the virus to coordinate envelopment. The immediate goal of this application is to better define the role of the putative matrix protein F13 in intracellular envelopment of EV and its relationship with the other EV glycoproteins. We propose 3 aims to better understand the function of F13: 1) Interrogate interactions between F13 and IMV surface proteins. We hypothesize that F13 acts as a matrix protein and provides a link between the outer EV membrane and the inner IMV particle and facilitates interactions with IMV at the site of intracellular envelopment, the TGN. In this aim we will further characterize interactions between F13 and IMV surface proteins. 2) Uncover cellular and viral proteins that interact with the putative matrix protein F13. We will use BioID to identify viral and cellular proteins that interact with F13 during specific stages of envelopment. 3). Determine the relationship between F13, glycoprotein content, EV cell binding, and non fusogenic dissolution for virus entry. We will utilize a panel of recombinant viruses to determine how F13 controls glycoprotein content and how this effects cell binding and entry of EV. The results obtained from these studies will provide greater insight into the molecular mechanism poxviruses use to produce infectious EV, spread cell-to-cell, and cause disease in their hosts. This information will in turn inform intelligent decisions in designing recombinant poxvirus vectors for both vaccines and oncolytic platforms.",1,1b
C06879,"Continuous Monitoring of COVID-19 Symptomatology for Elderly Patients in Long Term Care Facilities Using Advanced, Soft, and Flexible Sensors Mounted on the Suprasternal Notch","Project Summary:  COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly1 with thegreatest risk in those cared for in long-term care facilities (LTCs) where mortality ratesrange from 19% to 72% worldwide. Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains aparticular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficientmolecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitatesa critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and trackCOVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development ofnovel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR,was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-lowprofile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto-mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axisaccelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensorcommunicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streamingas well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams arecloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows forthe ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density.Specifically, we exploit the SN-the only location on the body where there is nodampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN-mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature,physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novelrespiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop anew COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our coughalgorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluateusability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partnerLTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDAEmergency Use Authorization. Our team of experts in engineering, dermatology,gerontology, and machine learning are highly qualified to develop this COVID-19surveillance system that offers both commercial and clinical value with broadapplicability to a wide range of other respiratory and chronic medical conditions after thepandemic subsides.","1, 4","1a, 4a"
P21245,DIFFERENTIATION AND FUNCTION OF MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES,"Project Summary Although much remains unclear with respect to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the possibilities that cytokine storm and altered coagulation contribute to adverse disease pathogenesis have emerged. Both the cytokine output and promotion of coagulation may be mediated by activated monocytes. Monocytes, for instance, are the central leukocyte in blood to express tissue factor (F3) and initiate coagulation and this activity promotes comorbidity in Ebola and HIV infections. One cytokine that seems most notably elevated in plasma of COVID patients is IL-6. In keeping with the potential importance of IL-6 in cytokine storm, our preliminary data reveal that blood monocytes, of all subsets, are a major source of IL-6 in COVID leukocytes and that their production of IL-6 positively correlates with adverse disease progression. Surprisingly, though monocytes produce cytokines, other features of canonical activation were not present in monocyte subsets of COVID patients. Particularlyy, induction of functional tissue factor in IL-6-producing monocytes was minimal to absent. This was in striking contrast to control monocytes from healthy subjects treated ex vivo with LPS or resiquimod. Giventhe clinical concern that coagulation may be altered in COVID-19 and contribute to pathogenesis of adversedisease and given the very robust expression of IL-6, we were especially surprised that tissue factor was notinduced. Overall, it appears that the stimulus for activation of monocytes in COVID-19 patients is distinct fromcanonical responses that also induce tissue factor in cytokine-producing cells, or perhaps a subset ofmonocytes able to activate the tissue factor pathway is missing or in extracted COVID-19 PBMCs. Theoverarching aim of this work is to define, using a robust longitudinal dataset, whether proinflammatory activation of monocyte subsets in blood associates with disease severity and to define the core characteristics of such activation. We will also carry out exploratory analyses in search of signals that lead to such activation. A key resource for our proposal is access to a bank of frozen PBMC, serum, plasma and whole blood in which longitudinal blood draws are being collected on 300 COVID-19 patients of differing disease severity admitted to Barnes Jewish Hospital. This bank has been established by the Institutional Clinical and Translational Research program at Washington University School of Medicine. Resources from this bank will be coupled with a stock of frozen PBMCs from >50 control participants in our laboratory and PBMCs from HIV subjects, where the state of monocyte activation will be compared with that of monocytes derived from COVID patients.",4,4b
C09716,Smart Workspace past Covid-19,"The work environment has changed significantly over the last decade with more working from home, video meetings and work in open landscapes. With Covid-19, this change has been accelerated as organizations and employees have been forced to adopt new ways of working. Even after the measures of Covid-19 has ceased, it is expected that more people will work from home, more meetings will be done over video and the office will be where you go for live discussions and social interactions with your colleagues, partners and customers. Thus the work place needs to be more dynamic and flexible going ahead. Having office space that is not suited for the new way of working will give unhappy employees, low productivity and lower utilization of the office which is both costly as well as an environmental challenge.    Real estate is the second main cost for companies, and an area that has been overlooked for too long. Before Covid-19, companies reported that up to 40% of meeting rooms are booked but unused , while 40% of employees report wasting up to 30 minutes a day searching for spaces to collaborate, and 50% of meetings occur with just one or two people in the space . The accumulated cost of unused offices, energy and lack of productivity accounts for over a billion NOK in Oslo alone and almost a trillion euros worldwide, yearly!    Unless offices adapt and are provided with tools so user needs are better matched, the waste in productivity and real estate will increase drastically leading to both economical as well as environmental losses.    This project will provide solutions to these problems by:    1) Optimize real estate by a) increasing desk utilization, b) eliminating the fake usage problem and c) matching room sizes with actual needs    2) Augmenting user satisfaction by a) quickly guiding users, b) delivering resources closer to the time of consumption and c) finding colleagues in real time    3) Ensuring policy and safety including a solution for social distancing.",10,10c
C09637,Engaging and empowering communities in responding to COVID-19 in low resource countries: A case study of Ghana,"The control of epidemics and pandemics such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), remain a challenge to the global community's efforts toward achieving the set targets of sustainable development goal 3 (SDG 3) - ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages  (Galati, 2015, Sundewall and Forsberg, 2020, United Nations, 2020). Even more developed countries, which were thought to have stronger health care systems have experienced challenges in their response to covid-19. The effect of global pandemics tend to be greater on Sub Saharan Africa, because of limited workforce and other resources available to already overstretched and weak health care systems. Additionally, poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, socio-cultural beliefs and practices are rife. Such factors contributed to community distrust of the health care system and sometimes poor cooperation resulting in high rates of infections and the loss of several thousand lives in the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in 2014 - 2015 (Phillip, 2014, Wang et al., 2020).   Sub Saharan African countries like Ghana need to strengthen community engagement and empowerment in health delivery, to ensure early and timely delivery of services, curbing widespread infections, reducing stress on health care systems and saving lives, which will accelerate achievement of SDG3 (Hanson et al., 2017). Ghana introduced the community-based health planning and services (CHPS) concept in 1997, to support its relatively weak health care system. The aim of CHPS is to mobilize community leadership, decision making systems and resources in a defined catchment area, the placement of reoriented frontline health staff with logistic support and community volunteer systems to provide services according to the principles of primary health care (Frimpong, 2020). Subsequently the Ghana Health Service and its partner organisations have established CHPS compounds in most districts in Ghana to offer primary health care in communities. The CHPS facilities are under the Ghana Health Service, which is the government's health service provision agency. Currently, Ghana has 1,550 convid-19 cases with 10 deaths (Ghana Health Service, 2020a). Government's strategy in combatting covid-19 include closure of Ghana's boarders with her neighbours, general surveillance, enhance contact tracing, health education and treating cases (Ghana Health Service, 2020b). There have been anecdotal reports of developments that are currently hampering government's efforts in combating covid-19 such as resistance of community members to contact tracing and testing. Stigmatization of covid-19 victims and survivors and outright refusal by some communities to allow government to use public buildings sited in their locality as quarantine centres (Darko, 2020, Ghana Web, 2020a, Ghana Web, 2020c). Also, community leaders have bemoaned government's failure to engage them in the fight against covid-19 (Ghana Web, 2020b). This raises concerns on why government's efforts at using CHPS to engage and empower communities has not yielded the desired results in the fight against covid-19.     2) Aims or research questions being addressed  Research Goal   To explore and understand how the Ghana health service has engaged and empowered communities to support the fight against convid-19.  Specific objectives  •	To understand how the Ghana Health Service has engaged and empowered communities in the fight against covid-19  •	To understand the gaps in the engagement and empowerment efforts of communities in the fight against convid-19  •	To explore innovative ways that the Ghana Health Service can employ to improve engagement and empowerment of communities to respond to the fight against covid-19 and other infectious diseases  	  Research questions  •	How has the government engaged and empowered communities in the fight against covid-19?  •	What have they engaged communities on?   •	What has been the response of communities?  •	How can the challenges in engaging and empowering communities be addressed to support their work?      3) Study design   The study design will be ethnographic using indepth interviews (IDIs), focus group discussions and observations in two communities. Ethnographic qualitative design is the appropriate approach for this study, as the study seeks to understand behaviours such as communities' interactions with the Ghana health system, communities' experiences in empowerment processes and their response to the fight against covid-19 (Patton, 2002).   Two communities with CHPS compounds would be purposively selected for the study and one community under each CHPS compound will be purposively selected for the study. In each CHPS compound two frontline staff will be purposively selected to participate in the IDIs. Two Ghana Health Service managers from the study district will be included in the study. Twenty-four IDIs will be conducted, 12 in each community with chiefs, elders etcetera (the list below gives the breakdown). They will be purposively selected for face-to-face IDIs, which will seek to understand how the health system has engaged and empowered communities in the fight against covid-19. Focus group discussions will be conducted with women, men and adolescents on the same theme. The focus group discussions would consist of 6 to 13 participants, who would be purposively selected to participate. Participation will be voluntary and those who are not interested would be automatically excluded, as well as those who are mentally challenged. Observations would be carried out in key public places to identify community resources.

The Municipality also shares boundaries with the Republic of Togo to the east, which makes it to a very interactive district. The population of the Municipality according to 2010 population and housing census stands at 160,756 with 75,648 males and 85,108 females (Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, 2006, Wikipedia, 2019).     Data management  Interviews and observation notes will be recorded using a digital recorder. The recorders and the transcribed data will be anonymized and accessible only to the study team and will be used only for the purposes of the study. After the study the anonymized data sets would be uploaded onto the UHAS data sharing portal and will be made available to students for academic work.   Data analysis: Transcribed data (IDIs, FGDs, observation notes) will be uploaded onto a computer and transferred onto qualitative software NVivo 12 to support data coding and analysis. Thematic analysis will be conducted, which will form the basis of reporting study results.   Ethical issues: All ethical procedure will be followed. The protocol will be submitted to the University of Health and Allied Sciences' ethics review committee for approval. Selection and participation in the study will be purely voluntary.     4) Approach used to maximise the impact of research outputs, to improve health and the research community   The approach that would be used to maximise research output will be as follows:  •	Publication of at least two articles from the study in open access journals  •	Development of policy briefs that will be shared with the Ghana Health Service, CHPS compounds, the department of infectious diseases of Ghana and it will also be posted on the Institute of Health Research of the University of Health and Allied Sciences website  •	The study results will be disseminated at local and international conferences   •	Durbars, which are open air meetings, will be organized to share the results with community members   •	Dissemination workshops would be held with health workers and managers in the study district to share the findings with them   •	The results would be presented at the Institutes' monthly technical meetings     5) Expected outcomes  The following are the expected outcomes:  •	The results will contribute to understanding the extent to which the government has engaged and empowered communities in the fight against covid-19  •	Challenges in community engagement and empowerment would be identified and recommendations to address them would be proposed  •	The results would reveal community response to government's engagement and empowerment efforts in their fight against epidemics and global pandemics such as covid-19 in Ghana  •	The results will unearth strategies to strengthening engagement and empowerment of communities to support the Ghana health care system in fighting diseases such as covid-19 within communities   •	The results could support policy revisions of community engagement and empowerment approach currently being applied in Ghana  6) Your role in the project  The study will involve a team of five researchers: a supervisor, a principal investigator and three field assistants. My role will be the principle investigator, which will include designing the study protocol and study guides, training of field assistants, leading the research team in data collection, analyzing the data gathered, drafting the results into publications, developing policy briefs and presentations and writing and coordinating the dissemination process. I will also liaise with the funders to update them on the developments of the study.    Selected reference  DARKO, K. A. 2020. 2 Covid-19 patients at Old Fadama on the run [Online].

PMID: 33318491  The response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been hampered by lack of an effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral therapy. Here we report the use of remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19 and the prototypic genetic antibody deficiency X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). Despite evidence of complement activation and a robust T cell response, the patient developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, without progressing to multi-organ involvement. This unusual clinical course is consistent with a contribution of antibodies to both viral clearance and progression to severe disease. In the absence of these confounders, we take an experimental medicine approach to examine the in vivo utility of remdesivir. Over two independent courses of treatment, we observe a temporally correlated clinical and virological response, leading to clinical resolution and viral clearance, with no evidence of acquired drug resistance. We therefore provide evidence for the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in vivo, and its potential benefit in selected patients.",6,6a
C09966,JIU-JITSU WITH MISINFORMATION IN THE AGE OF COVID: USING REFUTATION-BASED LEARNING TO ENHANCE VACCINE UPTAKE AND KNOWLEDGE AMONG HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND THE PUBLIC,"Vaccine hesitancy-the delay or refusal of vaccination without medical indication-has been cited as a serious threat to global health by the World Health Organization (WHO), attributing it to misinformation on the internet. The WHO has also identified Health Care Professionals (HCPs) as the most trusted influencers of vaccination decisions.  JITSUVAX leverages those insights to turn toxic misinformation into a potential asset based on two premises: 1. The best way to acquire knowledge and to combat misperceptions is by employing misinformation itself, either in weakened doses as a cognitive ""vaccine"", or through thorough analysis of misinformation during ""refutational learning"". 2. HCPs form the critical link between vaccination policies and vaccine uptake.  The principal objective of JITSUVAX is to leverage misinformation about vaccinations into an opportunity by training HCPs through inoculation and refutational learning, thereby neutralizing misinformation among HCPs and enabling them to communicate more effectively with patients. JITSUVAX comprises 4 scientific work packages (WPs 1-4), plus one Management WP (WP0).  WP1 will systematically measure HCP attitudes towards vaccinations across participating countries.  WP2 will analyse argumentation by anti-vaccination activists to provide material for inoculation and refutational learning. WP2 will also develop novel tools that improve public resilience to misinformation and HCP's knowledge and attitudes concerning vaccinations.  WP3 will translate the findings from WP1 and WP2 into practice, by exploring several new tools, ranging from a new ""empathic refutational interview"" to interventions in the training of HCPs.  WP4 focuses on impact and dissemination. WP4 will design and develop a guidance document for HCPs and public health bodies. Through the team's contacts and previous collaborations with WHO and UNICEF, we will disseminate and leverage our new knowledge for global impact.","9, 11","9c, 9d, 11f"

C03150,"COVID-19 Physical Distancing and Post-Traumatic Stress Injury: Utilization of Digital Health and Remote Mental Health Services for Military, Veterans, and Public Safety Personnel","Physical distancing arising from COVID-19 has rapidly forced a paradigm shift toward remote mental health (MH) service delivery and a surge in the use of digital health (DH) (e.g., teletherapy/medicine, eHealth, and mHealth). Though limited in use mere weeks ago, DH has become essential for system access, assessment, and treatment. Legal, clinical, cultural, practical, and security considerations, however, remain unaddressed for delivering MH services to trauma-affected populations (TAPs). TAPs include public safety personnel (PSP; e.g., border services, communications officials, correctional workers, firefighters, paramedics, police, etc.), military members, and Veterans struggling with Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries (PTSIs) and other MH concerns that can be associated with or exacerbated by the pandemic. As TAPs may be particularly affected by changes from in-person to digital delivery of MH services, an understanding is needed of: (1) the clinical effectiveness of DH when addressing PTSIs; (2) perspectives of persons with lived experience, MH clinicians, senior leadership and policymakers; (3) the current context, needs, and considerations associated with DH uptake and use; and (4) realistic solutions for effectively delivering DH to TAPs. The HiMARC research team, with its established relationships with PSP, military, and Veteran communities in Alberta and beyond, is well-positioned to conduct a current state and needs analysis through a rapid review and key stakeholder engagements with the aim of synthesizing knowledge of needs, gaps, barriers, and facilitators for DH delivery of PTSI assessment and interventions. A co-designed, multi-phased knowledge mobilization and implementation plan coordinated with national efforts (e.g., CIPSRT and CIMVHR) will be created to deliver safe digital MH services at local, national, and international levels to PSP, military, Veteran, and civilian populations suffering from MH conditions including PTSIs.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
C14312,"Children, acceptable health risks and COVID-19: Ethical guidance for a fair policy response","To respond to the pandemic the NHS deployed strategies (e.g. usual service restriction, changes in care delivery, redeployment of staff and clinic space) which had an immediate effect on children's usual care. To date, the direct impact of Covid-19 infection on children's physical health has been recorded as being far milder than for other groups. By contrast the indirect impact on children has been profound, with substantial reductions in urgent activity in hospitals (von Dadelszen, Khalil, Wolfe et al. 2020 BMJ). There are no known studies which assess the extent to which health service restrictions and changes in care delivery are fair for children.    This project, undertaken in collaboration with NHS child healthcare specialists, aims to address the omission of a children-related ethical dimension in Covid-19 related research and policy. It will achieve this by exploring which risks on children's physical and mental health can be morally justified in health systems' response to the pandemic. This project will provide accessible ethical guidance to medical authorities and government departments on how the needs of children with long-term conditions should feature in the prioritisation process required in the pandemic context. This guidance will be assessed, in context, in conjunction with a range of decision-makers who are responsible for making decisions about the allocation to resources and by working closely with the clinical-academic Children and Young People's Health Partnership (CYPHP) in South East London.","8, 9","8c, 9c"
P23472,PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING OF VACCINE AGAINST COVID-19,"Funding of research and innovation programmes for the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine against COVID-19 disease    The overall objective is to leverage co-funding from the European Commission to support CEPI'Äôs COVID-19 vaccine programme development efforts. The COVID-19 outbreak has in a short timeframe grown to a global pandemic of historic proportions, with detrimental humanitarian and economic consequences. All evidence now suggests that eradication of COVID-19 is not feasible and that we face a global public health crisis which is unprecedented in modern times. At present there are no treatments, and there is no vaccine. Investing in vaccine development now is an investment in the future health for all in our societies and a return to social and economic development 'Äì both in Europe and in the rest of the globe.     CEPI is now seeking scientifically excellent research and development vaccine development programmes of a nature that will allow the broadest global access of the vaccines that are ultimately developed both within the current pandemic crisis and beyond. This will help curb the current ongoing outbreak, that is resulting in human suffering and a grave global economic crisis. CEPI was set up to respond to the crisis, where our vision is a world in which epidemics are no longer a threat to humanity. Our strategic objectives are further aligned with the sustainable development goals 3, 8 and 17. Of particular importance to CEPI'Äôs work is to ensure that low- and low-middle income countries (LICs and LMICs, respectively) will have access to the vaccines to protect their most vulnerable population, as soon as a vaccine is made available and irrespective of their ability to pay. As the current pandemic has shown, viruses respect no boarders. To successfully curb the COVID-19 pandemic, we must ensure that all countries have the necessary tools to control the outbreak domestically.  No-one is safe until everyone is safe.",12,12c
P21756,Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 to treat MERS-CoV and related emerging CoV,"Project Summary  Zoonotic viruses, like filoviruses and coronaviruses (CoV), represent a continuous and growing threat to global  public health because they unpredictably emerge causing devastating outbreaks of pandemic disease. In the  21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory  syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools of viruses, causing severe disease in  humans. MERS-CoV is endemic in camels in the Middle East with continuous new infections in humans.  Although SARS-CoV is not currently a threat, several Ã¢Â€ÂœprepandemicÃ¢Â€Â SARS-like CoVs have been isolated from  bats that replicate efficiently in human cells and are resistant to existing therapies. With the unpredictable  overlap of human and wild animal ecologies, the potential for novel CoV emergence into humans is highly  probable. Currently, there are no approved antiviral therapies for any human CoV infection. Broad-spectrum  CoV therapies that control known human and zoonotic CoV infections would address an immediate unmet  medical need and could counter future pandemic episodes. In partnership with Gilead Sciences, we have  demonstrated that the nucleoside prodrug, GS-5734, is highly efficacious in inhibiting multiple human and  zoonotic CoV in vitro and SARS-CoV in vivo. The primary goal of our program is to accelerate the preclinical  development of GS-5734 and promote IND licensure for the MERS-CoV indication. To thoroughly evaluate the  breadth of antiviral activity and predict efficacy against future emerging CoV, we will also assess efficacy  against a panel of CoV representative of family-wide genetic diversity, including prepandemic zoonotic strains  poised for emergence. Focusing on the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, our unique partnership integrates: i)  metagenomics and recombinant virus synthetic genome recovery, ii) primary human lung cell models, iii)  cutting edge virology and biochemistry, iv) robust murine and primate models of human disease and v) state of  the art metabolic and pharmacokinetic analysis. In Aim 1, we refine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  and breadth of GS-5734 through efficacy and metabolism studies in various primary human cells with a diverse  array of human and zoonotic CoV and through the evaluation of in vivo efficacy in murine and non-human  primate models of MERS- and SARS-CoV. In Aim 2, we select for resistance against SARS-CoV and MERS-  CoV, and determine the effect of resistance on virus replication, fitness and susceptibility to treatment. In Aim  3, we determine if the mechanism of action of GS-5734 is a result of direct effects on viral RNA replication  and/or alteration of antiviral immunity via deep sequencing and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ  hybridization of vehicle or drug treated infected cells and mice. We articulate a development strategy for broad-  spectrum therapeutics that could be extended to a multitude of emerging viral pathogens threatening global  public health.",6,6a
P22865,Triggering germline-encoded broadly neutralizing antibody responses against influenza virus,"Project Summary / Abstract  This is an application by Dr. Daniel Lingwood and Dr. Facundo Batista, faculty members of the Ragon Institute  of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Both investigators define B cell-antigen recognition principles to inform antibody  vaccine design, and for this, have developed two orthogonal transgenic mouse models that recapitulate human  antibody responses in vivo. The investigators propose to apply these models to evaluate germline stimulation  of human B cell lineages known to give rise to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAbs) against influenza A  viruses (IAV), which account for the majority of flu-hospitalizations and pandemic threats. Most antibody  responses to IAV are dominated by off-target, non-neutralizing activities, however, work from the investigators  indicates that human BCRs assembled from the antibody VH gene, IGHV1-69, possess natural specificity for a  conserved site of vulnerability, the stem-bnAb epitope on the hemagglutinin spike proteins from Group 1 IAV  (IAV subtypes: H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H12, H16). To test if this genetically endows for vaccine-  amplifiable bnAb development pathways, the investigators have engineered the LINGWOOD mouse system,  where antibodies develop with human antibody VH genes (e.g. IGHV1-69) and full human CDRH3 diversity.  Genetic manipulation of this system enables in vivo B cell titration to match the IGHV1-69 B cell frequency  found in humans. Sequentially immunizing these mice with SS-np, a nanoparticle displaying the bnAb target,  has succeeded in germline stimulation of IGVH1-69 bnAb precursors and IGHV1-69-dependent expansion of  bnAb responses; the first example of eliciting high titer IAV bnAbs through vaccination. This response also  provided broad protection against Group 1 IAV, including pandemic bird flu, supporting the investigators'  central hypothesis that broadly protective bnAbs can be elicited by germline antibody-targeting vaccines. In  Aim 1, the investigators will define whether SS-np stands as a universal booster of the IGHV1-69-encoded  bnAb response after introduction of B cell memory to diverse IAV `swarms' that simulate human immune  history to influenza. In Aim 2, the investigators will define how refocusing serum antibodies against this specific  bnAb target also enhances antibody Fc effector functions, potentially co-enabling protection through activation  of innate immunity. In Aim 3, the BATISTA mouse system will be used to evaluate vaccine-expansion of  IGHV1-69 bnAbs alongside the human IGHV1-18- and IGHV6-1-class bnAb lineages, which neutralize the  remaining Group 2 IAV subtypes (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15). In this system, murine IgM B cells bearing  individual human bnAb precursors of each pathway are co-transferred to a single recipient mouse. Following  immunization, lineage expansions are individually tracked via their progression through B cell germinal centers  and then into immune memory. The animals will be co-immunized with SS-np, SS-np2, and SS-np3; three  geometrically identical nanoparticles bearing distinct affinities for each bnAb precursor. Selective + collective  expansion of these bnAb lineages aims to overcome failure of traditional influenza vaccine approaches.","1, 7","1d, 7i"

C15148,Understanding the interplay between local viral infection and local inflammation in COVID-19 kidney injury,"PROJECT ABSTRACT  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), affecting more than  a third of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and up to 90% of those requiring mechanical ventilation. Possible  contributors to AKI in patients with COVID-19 include systemic inflammation and cytokine release, hemodynamic  compromise, and intravascular coagulation. Additionally, several reports have suggested the presence of SARS-  CoV-2 viral particles or viral RNA in the kidney tissue of patients who died from COVID-19, suggesting a potential  role for local viral infection in the kidney.  SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect and replicate in kidney cell lines, and in preliminary data we show that viral RNA  can be amplified from the urine of patients with severe COVID-19 and AKI, even after the virus has been cleared  in the respiratory tract. Genetic analysis of those viral RNA in urine demonstrated a predominant pattern of  deletions and mutations at the furin-cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 that have not been observed in over 180,000  SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from respiratory tract samples deposited in the publicly available database  GISAID. However, those mutations have been reported to occur after virus passaging in the African green  monkey kidney cell line Vero-E6, raising the possibility that those mutations might be positively selected following  virus replication in kidney cells.  The primary goal of this application is to understand the interplay between local viral infection and local  inflammation in COVID-19-related kidney injury by leveraging our expertise in the study of HIV-related kidney  disease. Our specific objectives are 1) to isolate and genetically characterize SARS-CoV-2 from urine samples  of COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate or severe disease, 2) to explore the relationship between SARS-CoV-  2 infection of renal cells and urine inflammatory markers; and 3) to determine the impact of genetic mutations on  viral fitness.  Understanding the role of direct viral infection of renal epithelial cells is key to the design of interventions to  prevent and treat AKI in COVID-19. Further characterization of the viral mutants isolated from urine may  provide insight into viral pathogenesis and would inform the design of antiviral and adjunctive therapies for  SARS-CoV-2 infection.","1, 4","1b, 1c, 4a"
C15865,"The impact of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus on skeletal muscle: morphological, biochemical and functional analysis","COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has been drastically affecting the lifestyle of millions of people in the past few months. Studies have shown that COVID-19 is a multiorgan disease that affects not only the respiratory tract of infected individuals, but it has considerable effects on the musculoskeletal system, causing excessive fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, muscle weakness and damage to skeletal muscles. These symptoms can persist even after the infection ends, perduring for months and impacting the daily lives of individuals who, in theory, should have fully recovered. Some studies have indicated that the muscle weakness observed in COVID-19-positive individuals could be an effect of the deregulated immune response (""cytokine storm"") that occurs during the course of the disease, and several pro-inflammatory interleukins have been found at high levels in the serum of studied patients. However, little is known about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on skeletal muscles, especially of individuals who did not require hospitalization and/or ventilatory support. Therefore, we will analyze the contractile properties of fibers and myofibrils of skeletal muscles from individuals who presented the mild-to-moderate forms of COVID-19 and recovered from it, as well as the content of sarcomeric proteins and cytokines, relating this content to the possible effects of a deregulated immune response. We aim to contribute to a better understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on the musculoskeletal system.","1, 4","1d, 4b"

C20410,Supporting mental health and preventing moral injury among long term care+ workers: A mixed methods tool kit development and implementation study,"Long term care+ (LTC+) is at the center of tragic outcomes of COVID‑19 and LTC+ workers are facing pronounced risk for occupational stress related injuries including moral injury. Moral injury results from guilt and/or shame that accompanies knowing what is needed yet being unable to do what is needed owing to constraints outside one's control (Dean, 2020). For LTC+ workers, moral injury may occur from experiences such as guilt over being required to ""police"" end of life visits where family members are only permitted to touch dying loved ones through gloved hands. Moral injury is being newly and necessarily applied to understand occupational stress of health care workers during COVID‑19 because compared to individually focused concepts such as burnout, moral injury locates the source of problems in the structures and processes in which individuals are immersed. Our research question is: how do we support mental health and help prevent moral injury among LTC+ workers? Our objectives are to: 1-gather stakeholder evidence about worker mental health needs and moral injury risks; 2-collect stakeholder assessments of a selection of mental health support/moral injury prevention tools; 3-create and disseminate a mental health support/moral injury prevention toolkit tailored to LTC+ workers in pandemic conditions; and 4-develop theory and evidence-based implementation strategies for scaling and spreading our toolkit.","10, 11","10a, 11f"
P25436,Development and manufacture of an improved replication-deficient simian adenoviral  vector to prevent COVID-20,"The University of Oxford and Vaccitech jointly developed and then exclusively out- licensed a serogroup E chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to AstraZeneca. This vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, given as a single dose, has moved into Phase 2/3 studies in the UK, and in August 2020 begins Phase 3 studies in the US and Brazil. There are concerns that anti-vector immunity to the ChAdOx1 backbone may limit early boosting responses, or even boosts given on a yearly basis. Vaccitech has developed an alternative serogroup C chimeric gorilla adenoviral vector vaccine (""GAdVac""), which has been shown in completed murine studies to elicit higher antibody and T cell immune responses than the ChAdOx1 candidates. Vaccitech is now developing the full-length spike glycoprotein encoding GAdVac candidate and will use this as both a stand-alone vaccine and evaluate the use of this candidate as a prime and a boost for the ChAdOx1 platform. Efficacy studies in ferrets will be pursued with Public Health England at Porton Down. The pre-master virus seed will be produced in the SOP- controlled Early Development Laboratories at Vaccitech in Oxford, and then transferred to Advent (Rome, Italy) for GMP manufacture. Advent has successfully made three GMP released lots of ChAdOx1 vectors for Vaccitech. Scientific advice will be sought from MHRA, and a formal GLP toxicology study will be performed due to the novelty of this vector. Within 12 months, the CTA to begin a Phase 1 immunogenicity study will be complete.",7,"7a, 7c"
P22589,"Project 1 Viral Genomics: surveillance, epidemiology, host response, and viral immunogenicity","Ensuring a world safe from microbial threats remains a pressing challenge. However, significant gaps remain  in our understanding of viral diseases. This proposal employs genomics to address these three major needs:  Genomic detection and epidemiology of emerging viral threats in humans and vectors<. For emerging viruses,  such as Lassa, Ebola, Zika, Powassan, and other NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogens, the natural  prevalence, evolution, genetic diversity, and transmission among and between humans and zoonotic hosts are  not well characterized, which threatens our ability to prepare for and even identify human cases when they  occur. Pathogen genomics provides critical public health insight into the movement of viral threats. In  partnership with established clinical, public health, and academic collaborators in West Africa and  Massachusetts, this project will sequence viruses both human patients and zoonotic reservoirs (African  rodents, American ticks and mosquitoes), publicly distribute genomic and metagenomic datasets, and rapidly  deliver analyses relevant to the evolution, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses, with a focus on insights  that may inform the ongoing development work of diagnostics, therapeutics, and other intervention strategies.  Tissue-specific and single-cell characterizations of host response and viral dynamics during viral hemorrhagic  fever infection<. Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) like Ebola and Lassa are highly fatal, but how the molecular  and cellular host response mechanisms differ between fatal and non-fatal cases is poorly understood. In  partnership with NIAIDÃ¢Â€Â™s Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, MD (BSL-4), this project will sequence Ã¢Â€Â<in  vivoÃ¢Â€Â< VHF infections in animal model organisms, simultaneously profiling both the host transcriptional response  and viral replication and evolution within different host tissues, and utilizing single-cell RNA-seq approaches to  interrogate individual host PBMC types.

P21237,"US-UK Collaboration: Integrating ecology, epidemiology, and human interests to guide strategic management of zoonoses in complex wildlife reservoirs","Wild animals host a wide variety of pathogens that can spread to other animals and humans. Such<br/>diseases, including Ebola and COVID-19, significantly affect human health, agriculture and wildlife<br/>conservation. Historically, disease control methods (e.g. vaccination, therapeutics) have focused on<br/>humans or livestock rather than wild animal reservoirs. Focusing on disease control in wildlife could<br/>be more effective in preventing disease emergence in humans, but that approach is currently limited<br/>by three factors. First, many diseases are maintained in cycles that spread across landscapes, but<br/>wildlife diseases are notoriously difficult to assess at these large spatial scales, making responses to<br/>interventions unpredictable. Second, tools like vaccines have been difficult to administer to sufficient<br/>numbers of animals to actually reduce disease transmission in the wild. Third, interventions are<br/>usually bounded by societal constraints, both financial (e.g., limited funds to invest) and sociological<br/>(e.g., conflicting stakeholder interests). New technologies, including vaccines that can spread among<br/>wildlife and miniaturized animal-borne tracking systems, have unrealized potential to overcome these<br/>limitations.

We aim to develop a rapid synthesis of published literature to identify the common causes of stress, burnout, and depression in women in health care during pandemics. This includes professions such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, technicians, personnel support workers, community health workers. As part of this review, we will also explore strategies that can prevent serious psychosocial or mental health consequences as a result of these exposures. Women make up four in five health workers in Canada. In addition to their work responsibilities, they are faced with the burden of caring for families and children. Stress, burnout and depression can lead to substance abuse and suicidal ideations. Protecting the mental and emotional health and well-being of healthcare delivery personnel engaged in directly responding to COVID-19 pandemic is important for health workers own health, patient care, and for the viability of health-care systems.

P23166,"Development of a novel and broadly applicable thermostable bacteriophage VLPs platforms for vaccine design, drug delivery, and imaging","PROJECT SUMMARY  Virus-like particles (VLPs) resemble - in size, structure, and immunogenicity - the virus from which the coat or  envelope protein(s) are derived from except for the fact they lack a viral genome; VLPs are non-infectious and  are safe. These features have been exploited to develop VLP-based vaccines against human papillomaviruses  and hepatitis B virus; furthermore, coat proteins from ~70 viruses are currently being explored to develop VLP-  based vaccines against these viruses. VLPs from some of these viruses have also been used as display  platforms to develop chimeric VLPs displaying heterologous peptides from other infectious agents, tumor-  associated antigens and other metabolic diseases. The goal of these chimeric VLPs is to induce antibodies  against the heterologous antigen displayed on the platforms and not the platforms. In addition to serving as  display platforms, VLPs have also been used for targeted delivery of drugs or cargo to specific cancer cells.  While the candidate VLPs-based vaccines displaying heterologous peptides are very effective in animal  studies, in the majority of studies, VLPs platforms (including adenoviral VLPs or dodecahedron) are derived  from viruses that infect humans and in some cases, studies used VLPs platforms that had previously been  used to immunize the general population; a good example is HBV vaccine, with a global infant vaccination  coverage of 84% in 2015. Vaccines based on some of these platforms, with pre-existing antibodies in the  general population, are likely to be less immunogenic in humans. Additionally, there is a limitation on the size  of heterologous antigens that can be genetically displayed on some VLPs platforms making it challenging to  display a single peptide with multiple epitopes on the same VLPs. Moreover, most of the VLPs platforms are  temperature-sensitive making them less suitable in developing countries with poor refrigeration facilities.  In this proposal, the PI will develop and characterize novel thermostable bacteriophage VLPs platforms using  coat proteins from thermophilic viruses P23-77 and ÃŽÂ¦IN93. P23-77 and ÃŽÂ¦IN93 was isolated from bacteria that  grow at 70-75 Ã'Â°C. Thus VLPs derived from these viruses are likely to be stable at room temperature (RT) or  above RT. Additional benefit of these VLPs platforms is that because these viruses do not infect humans, the  human population lacks pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against the VLPs platforms; thus, the  immunogenicity of the platforms cannot be compromised by pre-existing antibodies. Also, many surface-  exposed loops on the capsid may tolerate larger insertions of heterologous antigens. The PI will co-express  three coat proteins from P23-77 and two coat proteins from ÃŽÂ¦IN93. The PI will assess whether the coat  proteins can assemble into VLPs, if they VLPs are thermostable, can tolerate heterologous peptide insertions  from human papillomaviruses, and if VLPs are immunogenic in comparison to the virus(es).",7,"7a, 7i, 7l"
C03887,DEVELOPMENT OF A REGULATORY T CELL MIMETIC FOR TOLERANCE INDUCTION IN SKIN TRANSPLANTATION,"In this competitive revision we propose to formulate a second generation of regulatory T cell (Treg) mimetic byincluding adenosine (ADO) to the biomaterials system, from muxTIC (TGF-β1, IL-10, and CTLA-4Ig) tomuxTICA. The purpose is to investigate the mechanistic aspects of muxTICA as a locally-delivered (bronchialinstillation) therapeutic for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We will test the capacity of thecombined immunosuppressive factors to skew alveolus macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in apro-inflammatory microenvironment. The experiments involve testing the agents in vitro using alveolarmacrophage lines, in human 3D airway epithelial tissues, and in a microfluidic shear cellular system.The rationale for exploring the immunosuppressive strategy is that COVID-19-induced ARDS is associatedwith excessive inflammation, characterized by rapid surges of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-17,IL-6 and TNFα. The clinical picture akin to the cytokine storm immunopathology reported in the patientsinfected with the coronaviruses emerged in 2002 (`SARS"") and 2012 (""MERS"").Because corticosteroids arenot recommended and might exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury, novel immunosuppressivestrategies are urgently needed to mitigate the hyper-inflammation associated with ARDS.Clinical studies indicate that Tregs can ameliorate ARDS. Survivors of COVID-19 infections have higherblood-circulating Tregs than non-survivors, and patients with elevated TGF-β1 and IL-10 have betteroutcomes. Mechanistically Tregs limit lung fibrosis form infections and inhibit excessive virus-specific T cellresponses. A major driver of ARDS in COVID-19 infected patients is massive infiltration of macrophagesinfiltration, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and prorogate inflammation, resulting in lung fibrosis andalveolar edema. Tregs has the capacity to steer macrophages an M2 regulatory, anti-inflammatory phenotype.In addition to TGF-β1, IL-10, and CTLA-4Ig, another phenotype-defining factor of Tregs' immunosuppressiveeffects is ADO. In an animal model of ARDS, bronchial instillation of ADO reduces microvascular permeabilityin the lungs. Therefore, we will include ADO in the formulation to generate muxTICA.The experiments proposed are designed to advance an off-the-shelf immunosuppressant strategy as a logicalextension of the original specific aims in the context of an urgent medical need. Therefore, the studies in theoriginal and revision applications are conceptually and technologically synergistic and complementary.",6,6a
C07289,COVID-19 rumours in historical context,"The COVID-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a pandemic of rumour and disinformation in the UK. Rumours about the origins of the virus, shortages, fake cures and government conspiracies are being spread by well-meaning people who want to make sense of the outbreak, as well as by criminals and hostile foreign governments. These rumours have the potential to cost lives, not least by undermining public confidence in any forthcoming vaccine. Despite the apparent novelty of 'fake news' and its circulation online, there is little that is new about these rumours, all of which have historical precedents. Yet policy-makers know little about how and why similar rumours have spread in the past, how previous governments have responded to them, and how successful these efforts were.    At a point in history where rumours about COVID-19 present an unprecedented health challenge, this project will deploy a novel longitudinal study of relevant historical rumours and government efforts to address them in order to assist policy-makers. It will track rumours circulating in the UK relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and any vaccination programme as they develop and compare them to historical precedents. A report, published in collaboration with History & Policy, as well as two closed workshops with policy-makers and scholars drawn from other disciplines, will seek to inform UK government strategies for dealing with mis- and disinformation and influence the tone and content of public information campaigns in order to minimise the harmful impact of 'fake news' and maximise uptake of any future vaccine.",9,9c
C03927,The Molecular Regulation of Horizontal Basal Cell Activation in the Olfactory Epithelium,"Project SummaryOlfactory dysfunction, including anosmia, is an unexpected and unexplained consequence of infection by the b-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and can be the sole manifestation of COVID-19. Existing bulk and single cell RNAseq datasets demonstrate that a very low percentage of nonneuronal cells - sustentacular (Sus) cells, horizontal basal cells (HBCs), and Bowman's gland and duct (BG/D) cells - of the olfactory epithelium (OE) express ACE2, the high affinity receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and the viral relevant proteases, TMPRSS2, FURIN and CATHEPSINS B and L. However, the lack of protein expression data prevents definition of which types and what percentage of cells are susceptible to infection. Specific Aim 1 proposes immunohistochemical evaluation of our library of human and mouse olfactory mucosa (OM) for the presence of the corresponding proteins using validated antibody markers for OE cell types and viral-relevant proteins. The inclusion of mouse allows us, first, to assess protein expression during OE regeneration, and, second, makes feasible subsequent experiments examining the interaction of virus with the olfactory periphery, whether in normal mice or ones that are made transgenic for hACE2, offering a humanized animal model and greatly enhancing our understanding of the disease. For example, other b-coronaviruses reach and decimate the CNS after intranasal inoculation even though olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) do not express the relevant receptors (Schwob et al, 2001). Even if Aim 1 demonstrates that a substantial percentage of non-neuronal cells express the machinery necessary to support infection and replication, the mechanism underlying the diminution/elimination of the sense of smell would remain obscure. Hence, Specific Aim 2 proposes the pathological examination of the impact of COVID-19 on the human OM and olfactory bulb (OB) in patients that die of the disease and come to autopsy at Massachusetts General Hospital, which Autopsy Service has agreed to supply us with these tissues. This Aim takes advantage of the PI's expertise in general anatomic pathology, and more specifically that of the diseased olfactory epithelium and bulb as well as the contributions of Dr. Eric Holbrook, co-I of this competitive revision, who will harvest the mucosa and assist in the analysis of the tissue. Besides conventional pathological assessment, the tissue will be interrogated for the presence of active virus, the type and extent of inflammatory infiltrate, and the loss of the various cell populations of the epithelium and bulb. The results will clarify whether and to what extent SARS-CoV-2 transits the OSNs and the olfactory nerve and damage the CNS as do other b-coronaviruses. Finally, Specific Aim 3 proposes high risk-high reward experiments based on our ability to differentiate the OE cell types from activated HBCs in vitro, which will then be assayed for the protein apparatus underlying infection and compared with the in vivo results obtained in Aims 1 and 2. When the Aims are completed successfully, the field will then be poised to begin the virological investigations in vitro and in vivo that will truly explain why olfactory dysfunction is such a hallmark of COVID-19.",1,1b

For active immunisation, a carrier virus that is not capable of replication in humans and has been tested for a long time is used, which produces the spike protein of the SARS 2 coronavirus in the vaccinated human and induces the formation of neutralising antibodies as well as a cellular (T-cell) immune response. The vaccine vector was developed at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich. The LMU is substantially involved in the clinical development with other sites of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF). Data already available speak for the immunological efficacy. Clinical development is being carried out with multi-centre clinical trials at partner institutions in Germany and abroad and is intended to create the prerequisite for approval of the vaccine. In parallel, the manufacturing technology for commercial production is being optimised and expanded at IDT Biologika GmbH.

P22191,Enhanced susceptibility to Zika virus during pregnancy: a role for maternal dengue antibodies,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is closely related to dengue virus (DENV). Since its discovery in 1947, ZIKV remained relatively unnoticed, causing small, local outbreaks primarily in parts of Africa and Asia, and was associated with minor symptoms, such as mild fever. However, in the last decade, ZIKV started to spread geographically across the Pacific islands, eventually reaching South America, where it caused an explosive outbreak that started in Brazil in 2015 and rapidly spread to other South and Central American countries. This has been accompanied by a startling link between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the development of birth defects among fetuses and babies, including microcephaly. It is unclear what factors may have led to the massive ZIKV outbreak or the severe disease manifestations in the Americas, but one potential variable is that much of the at-risk population in the Americas has preexisting immunity to DENV. It is well documented that preexisting immunity to one serotype of DENV can alter the disease pathogenesis of a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Because ZIKV outbreaks have occurred in regions around the world where DENV is endemic and due to the high degree of relatedness of ZIKV and DENV, it is critical to understand and characterize the extent to which prior infection with DENV exacerbates ZIKV disease. In this application, we will focus on how DENV antibodies impact ZIKV infection in the context of pregnancy by utilizing three model systems (immunocompromised Stat2-/- mice, immunocompetent humanized STAT2 knock-in mice, and human placental explants infected with ZIKV ex vivo).","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"

The research will increase understanding of how life situations in urban versus rural settings affect epidemic disease experiences and will provide knowledge of important community characteristics that put residents at greater risk during the current pandemic. The study will also shed light on which characteristics of a region have been stable over long periods of time and which are aspects of modern life and perhaps more malleable. The research is therefore time-sensitive because the investigators will expeditiously communicate project findings relevant to the current pandemic to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. In addition, this project will provide student training in data collection and first-hand experience in conducting research to help deal with an unforeseen and serious public health event. <br/><br/>A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to which humans possess little underlying immunity, has been spreading throughout the globe. In this pandemic setting, rural regions may face challenges that are not present in urban areas. As there is currently no vaccine, it is critical to devise effective strategies quickly, to protect rural regions from echo waves of the virus that may circulate over the next few years. The world experienced a similar situation in 1918-19 when a new, lethal strain of influenza began to infect humans. Although there are significant differences between these two pandemics, the viruses have similar modes of transmission and overall impacts on human communities. Understanding the experiences and responses of rural citizens to these two pandemics provides important insights that may lead to new public health strategies that are more tailored to the needs of rural residents during major disease outbreaks. The project involves in-depth comparative analysis of mortality and morbidity patterns during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the present COVID-19 pandemic in the state of Missouri. Analysis will focus on data aggregated at the county level and will determine county characteristics (e.g., population density, number of hospitals, household composition, proximity to large urban area, ethnic composition, mobility patterns) that are associated with death and/or illness rates during the two pandemics. Historical data from the Missouri 1918 influenza pandemic will be examined to identify control strategies used in different counties during the pandemic, determine their effectiveness, and assess whether they would be of use during the present pandemic. This in turn can aid in the development of potential strategies that public health authorities can add to the arsenal already being used in rural counties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",3,"3c, 3d"
P21488,Preclinical development of a vaccine for Nipah virus,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Nipah virus (NiV) causes febrile encephalitis and severe respiratory disease in humans with fatality rates as high  as 100% in some outbreaks (average ~ 75% for outbreaks over the last decade). There are currently no licensed  vaccines or therapies for combating NiV disease. NiV is classified as a Biosafety Level (BSL)-4 pathogen  because of the high mortality rates associated with infection, the lack of effective medical countermeasures, and  the ease of transmission. In addition to causing morbidity and mortality as a naturally acquired infection, NiV is  also categorized as a Category C priority pathogen by several US Government agencies because of the concern  for deliberate misuse. Importantly, NiV was recently included on the World Health OrganizationÃ¢Â€Â™s (WHO) 2018  List of Priority Pathogens. As a result of the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 there is heightened  concern and awareness regarding respiratory pathogens. Consequently, in March of 2020 the US CDC  recommended that NiV be added to the list of Tier 1 Select Agents. Studies to develop effective countermeasures  have been hampered by the highly pathogenic nature of NiV and its restriction to BSL-4 containment. An effective  prophylactic vaccine would find application with medical personnel and close contacts during outbreaks and with  laboratory workers engaged in research. A vaccine based on recombinant G protein deleted (ÃŽÂ""G) vesicular  stomatitis virus (rVSVÃŽÂ""G) pseudotyped with the glycoproteins (GP) of a number of high consequence viruses  have been shown to completely protect nonhuman primates (NHP) against Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses.  In addition, the effectiveness of a rVSV-vectored vaccine in preventing Ebola virus disease was demonstrated  in a ring vaccination, open-label, cluster-randomised trial in Guinea during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic. This  vaccine was recently licensed as ERVEBO by the European Union and US FDA. Recently, we developed  replication-restricted rVSV NiV vaccine vectors expressing the NiV glycoproteins. Importantly, we showed that  these vaccines can completely protect NHPs against high dose lethal NiV Bangladesh strain challenge when  used as single injection vaccines. This new data is critically important in the context of containing outbreaks as  the most effective vaccine in containing a respiratory pathogen and preventing a pandemic is a vaccine that  works rapidly with a single administration. Development of a replication restricted platform that provides improved  safety without compromising efficacy is a highly significant advancement and can be applied to other viruses  with pandemic potential. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a rVSV-based vaccine against NiV  (rVSV-NiVBG) that can provide both rapid protection and long term immunity against the most prevalent and  pathogenic Bangladesh strain of NiV and to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict protection. In regard  to product development, work will also be done to generate research cell bank (RCB) and viral vaccine bank  (RVB), a manufacturing process, and conduct of GLP-safety toxicology.",7,7a
P22143,American and Asian Centers for Arboviral Research and Enhanced Surveillance (A2CARES),"ABSTRACT  Recent pandemics of human pathogens have revealed the limitations of current surveillance systems. The  sequential arboviral epidemics in the Americas showed how outbreak detection can be delayed and opportunities  missed to collect well-characterized specimens and data for surveillance, basic science, clinical research, and  development of vaccines and new diagnostics. In response, we have assembled a consortium of world-renowned  investigators in arbovirology, epidemiology, immunology, viral diagnostics, phylogenetics, and clinical research,  while leveraging research infrastructure and expertise in long-term cohort and hospital-based studies. This has  resulted from 3 decades of collaborative international research, with over 200 joint publications, and extensive  experience in preparing for and responding to outbreaks working closely with local and international health  authorities and NIAID. With key sites in Asia and the Americas, we will use innovative molecular and serological  methods to identify emerging pathogens and to address fundamental questions in dengue and other arboviral  epidemiology and test viral, host and environmental determinants of differences between sites along a gradient  of urbanicity. Our overarching goal is to develop an interconnected, harmonized network of clinical and  laboratory sites to strengthen research programs, compare disease epidemiology and severity in  different regions, develop and implement cutting-edge diagnostic methods, and respond efficiently and  effectively to outbreaks. Standardized hospital studies and community-based cohorts in Ecuador, Nicaragua  and Sri Lanka will characterize and compare human arboviral illnesses across urban, peri-urban and rural sites  and develop sustainable infrastructure to rapidly respond to epidemics together with Ministries of Health, comple-  mented by outbreak investigation, surveillance of non-human primates, and vector incrimination. We will imple-  ment standardized plans for study administration, data and clinical management, and statistical analysis across  sites, supported by an extensive on-site training program. Aim 1 will establish standard and novel multiplex  assays at each site for surveillance, diagnosis and research of arboviruses and other pathogens. Aim 2 com-  pares dengue/arbovirus epidemiology and transmission in cohort studies located in ecologically distinct regions  over a continuum of urbanicity. In Aim 3, we will characterize complete viral genome sequences for comparative  studies of arboviral phylogenetics, phylogeography and molecular epidemiology. Aim 4 consists of surveillance,  identification, and characterization of novel and unrecognized human pathogens from severe hospitalized cases,  unexpected outbreaks, vectors and non-human primates. Molecular and serological assays will be developed  for newly identified pathogens and quickly implemented across study sites to characterize the epidemiology and  clinical manifestations and will be made available to the EIDRC network.

C20696,Elevating youth voice on mental health: Mobilizing co-created knowledge translation resources for Canadian secondary schools,"Schools are consistently identified as an ideal context to equitably address youth mental health (MH). However, in our research and youth engagement work, youth have expressed several barriers to accessing support within schools. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of the school context, and exacerbated pre-existing concerns, inequities in MH, and access to support. Moreover, youth have been consistently left out of conversations, despite recognition of the value of engaging youth to ensure research reflects their varied experiences and resultant resources meet the diverse needs of youth. This project aims to elevate youth voice through the development and dissemination of resources to improve how we support youth MH in secondary schools. We aim to co-develop and disseminate with youth (primary audience; engagement of two youth engagement committees) and school partners, namely teachers (secondary audience; engagement of a teacher advisory committee): 1) A social media suite of resources (posts, stories, reels) for Canadian secondary schools that includes MH statistics, our secondary qualitative findings, and information on available supports and how to access them. 2) A school MH brochure (2-3 pages) for Canadian secondary schools that shares national-, provincial-, and school- and community- specific MH resources. The brochure will be populated with existing national and provincial resources (e.g., Kids Help Phone, Youthspace.ca), with space allocated for schools to include school- and community-specific MH resources. 3) A national webinar and website to further disseminate resources. The webinar will bring together diverse stakeholders (e.g., school boards, policy makers, researchers, clinicians) to discuss Canadian youth MH with guest speakers (including youth) and introduce developed resources. A website will be co-developed with youth to host the freely available resources.","10, 9","10b, 9b"

P21746,A Transgenic Mouse Model to Study Ebolaviruses and other Filoviruses,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Ebola viruses and other members of the filovirus family cause severe and often lethal infections. While some  progress has been made in regards to the development of experimental countermeasures and insights into the  highly pathogenic nature of these viruses, there are still many more unanswered questions, and further  advancement is needed towards the development of pan-filovirus therapeutic agents and vaccines. A significant  hurdle to research on filoviruses is the accessibility and cost associated with high-containment, biosafety level-  4 laboratories. To partially alleviate this issue, we previously established a replication-defective Ebola virus  based on the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) genome. This virus, which lacks the essential viral gene VP30 (termed  EBOVÃŽÂ""VP30), is biologically inert and safe to use outside of highly specialized BSL-4 containment. In  engineered cell lines that stably express EBOV VP30, the virus becomes replication-competent; thus it is a  perfect EBOV surrogate for in vitro research given that EBOVÃŽÂ""VP30 resembles authentic virus in its life cycle,  morphology, protein composition, and growth kinetics. After extensive safety testing both in cell culture and in  animal models, the CDC and the Office of Science Policy at the NIH classified EBOVÃŽÂ""VP30 as a BSL-2 agent  and removed the virus from Select Agent regulations. Since then, this in vitro system to study EBOV has been  requested by and distributed to several other research laboratories.  The next step to advance the EBOVÃŽÂ""VP30 system is to develop an EBOV VP30 transgenic animal model to  support virus replication. Previously, we generated a transgenic mouse line that expressed EBOV VP30 under  the control of the chicken beta-actin promoter (CAG). Although we were able to detect VP30 mRNA in key  organs, such as the liver, and functional VP30 protein in cells, such as fibroblasts, we were unable to detect  VP30 mRNA and functional protein in monocyte-derived macrophages, the first target of EBOV infection and a  cell type essential for virus dissemination throughout the body. Here, we propose to generate a new transgenic  mouse line with EBOV VP30 expression under the control of the CD45 promoter, a promoter specific for  expression in hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Once we confirm the  expression and function of VP30 in these cell types, particularly macrophages, we will cross our two different  VP30 transgenic lines (CAG and CD45) to generate a double knock-in transgenic mouse line. Once established,  we will infect these transgenic mice with mouse-adapted EBOVÃŽÂ""VP30 and characterize the phenotype. We will  also generate chimeric versions of EBOVÃŽÂ""VP30 with glycoproteins from other filoviruses and examine the  phenotype of these chimeric viruses in the transgenic mice. After safety testing, this new small animal model will  be an ideal in vivo surrogate for the authentic mouse model for EBOV infection. For the first time, a transgenic  mouse model will be available that can be used efficiently and safely outside of BSL-4 containment to examine  EBOV pathogenesis and accelerate the development and evaluation of countermeasures.",1,"1b, 1c, 1e"
C20519,"Evaluating the Benefits of Rapid Access Addiction Medicine Clinics for Problematic Alcohol Use: A Retrospective Cohort Study to Inform Policy, Practice, and Future Research","Alcohol use in Canada, and globally, is a leading risk factor for disease, disability, and death. The COVID-19 global pandemic has also led to an increase in alcohol consumption amongst Canadians, with higher rates in individuals struggling with both mental health and substance use problems. The importance of access to care for problematic alcohol use (PAU) is at an all-time high. Treatment for PAU can be difficult to access, as there can be lengthy wait times for services, and care remains fragmented. In many cases, persons with PAU present themselves to be seen at emergency departments (ED) due to gaps in care, resulting in high use of the health care system. Rapid Access Addiction Medicine (RAAM) clinics have been implemented in recent years to provide easy access to evidence-based care for people with substance use problems so they can get the care they need, with the vital goal of improving their outcomes. RAAM clinics have opened in many regions within Canada to help individuals with PAU, however there remains a need to conduct analyses of their available data to evaluate the benefits they offer to people living in Canada and the healthcare system. It is also important to assess whether RAAM clinics provide sufficient value for the funding invested in their set-up and operation. In the proposed research, we will use statistical methods and anonymized health data to assess whether RAAM clinics have helped improve the outcomes of individuals with PAU, and whether they provide good value for money. Our research team consists of people with lived expertise as well as experts in research methods, addiction medicine, mental health, public health, and health services research. We have partnered with members of key organizations that can impact policy and practice regarding PAU here in Canada. ","10, 11","10a, 11a"
P21709,Tolerance and resistance responses of African bats to viral antigens: Immunological tradeoffs in zoonotic reservoir hosts.,"ABSTRACT  This project focuses on understanding the role that the unique physiology of bats plays in their ability to act as  host reservoirs for diseases that can spill over to humans. The project will be carried out under field conditions  in Uganda on three species of bats that have varying links to the spread of Ebola virus (EBOV) to humans. By  comparing the ability of these three species of bats to respond to Ebola-like immune challenges, this work will  help identify the characteristics that contribute to spillover risk. In the long term, this work will help identify host  species for EBOV and other related viruses that present risk to humans. It will also help explain how different  species of bats respond to different types of viral infections. The main focus of this project will be to identify  behaviors and molecular pathways that enable reservoir hosts to tolerate infections, providing critical insight  into one of the mechanisms that leads to spillover. This work is driven by the hypothesis that some bat species  have coevolved with particular types of viral infections and, therefore, have adapted mechanisms to minimize  pathology during infection. Bats are globally biodiverse and have many unique ecological and physiological  adaptations, including flight and the ability to employ both hypo- and hyperthermic body temperature  regulation. This project focuses on three bat species chosen because they are in close contact with humans,  their habitats cover the range of EBOV exposure risk, and they have divergent coevolutionary histories with  viral pathogens; two of the three species have significant ties to EBOV epidemiology. This project addresses  these questions under natural conditions in the field by taking the innovative approach of using EBOV virus-like  particles as a proxy for experimental infection with biohazardous pathogens. This project has three specific  aims that will allow the achievement of its goals. First, the project tests the hypothesis that specific African bat  species will display signatures of EBOV disease tolerance in response to challenge with EBOV virus-like  particles, and thus are likely to be natural reservoir hosts. These experiments will provide significant insight into  disease tolerance in bats and the potential identity of EBOV reservoir(s). Second, this project tests the  hypothesis that bats display variable levels of disease tolerance that depend upon innate immune pathways  that have undergone unique evolutionary selection in bats. Third, this project explores whether tolerance of  and resistance to viral infection are facilitated by the unique metabolic behaviors of bats, namely that they can  depress metabolism and enter torpor to conserve energy and can elevate metabolism and thus temperature  during flight. The role of changes in body temperature is poorly understood and these experiments will identify  whether these physiological responses contribute to immunological tolerance and resistance in important  disease reservoirs. Together, the successful completion of these goals will help determine whether infection  tolerance confers on African bat species the ability to serve as reservoir hosts for virulent zoonotic viruses and  will identify molecular, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to tolerance phenotypes.",2,2a
C15159,NK cell mobilization as a pathogenic etiology of SARS-CoV-2 gastrointestinal disease,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of Coronavirus  Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid global spread has led to an unprecedented global public health crisis.  Currently, treatment options are very limited and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are still pending widespread  use. Host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in the containment of the infection. Although  SARS-CoV-2 is generally thought of as a respiratory disease, an unexpected consequence is severe  complications of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Indeed, up to two-thirds of COVID-19 patients have some GIT  symptoms and several lines of evidence suggest a breakdown of the epithelial barrier resulting in widespread  inflammation.   While recent studies in COVID-19 patients and nonhuman primate (NHP) models described T lymphocytes  and antibody responses, less is known about natural killer (NK) cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Classically, NK cells are viewed as nonspecific effector cells of the innate immune system that play critical roles  in defense against viral infections. However, besides their ability to rapidly eliminate virus-infected cells without  the need for prior antigen sensitization, NK cells also exhibit adaptive immune functions. Different forms of  adaptive capabilities have been identified among human NK cell subpopulations, including reports of true  antigen-specific memory NK cells as well as adaptive NK cells with enhanced antibody-dependent functions. NK  cells may be crucial for early containment of SARS-CoV-2 and formation of adaptive responses elicited by  infection, yet uncontrolled NK response may also contribute to the hyperinflammatory responses observed in  COVID-19 patients, including in the GIT. In this proposal we will use NHP models, which recapitulate viral  replication, immune responses and disease pathology observed in human COVID-19 infection, to test the  following hypotheses: (i) pathogenic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract in COVID-19 is a  consequence, in part, of dysregulated or exacerbated NK cell responses, and (ii) specific subsets of NK  cells mediate potent anti-viral responses against SARS-CoV-2, associated with enhanced viral clearance  and reduced disease severity. We will address these hypotheses through two specific aims: 1. Determine the  contribution of systemic and GIT NK cell mobilization to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and clearance in macaque  models; 2. Evaluate the mechanisms by which specific innate and adaptive NK cell subpopulations modulate  SARS-CoV-2 infection in the GIT. If successful, the results of these innovative studies will contribute new  knowledge of human immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and provide the rationale to develop novel  immunotherapeutic approaches to target specific NK cell subsets that could substantially contribute to prevent  and treat COVID-19.",1,"1b, 1d, 1e"
C17934,Determining functional immunity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or natural infection in haemodialysis patients at high-risk of COVID-19,"Patients with comorbidities have a higher likelihood of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Amongst those worst affected are patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), who are 45 times more likely to die than matched populations. Tragically, ESKD patients requiring haemodialysis (ESKDHD) cannot shield and face unavoidable risks of infection through the necessity to attend hospital for treatment. Despite their intrinsic susceptibility to COVID-19, ESKD patients can generate antiviral antibodies and thus may respond to vaccination. Nevertheless, it is unknown if after natural infection or vaccination: i) anti-viral serum and mucosal (salivary) antibodies are induced and maintained comparably to matched controls; ii) antibodies are functional and neutralise infection/promote opsonisation; iii) Whether host immune cells (neutrophils/macrophages) +/-antibody control virus infection.To answer these unknowns we will address the following hypothesis and objectives: Hypothesis ""Antibodies and immune cells from vaccinated or naturally-infected ESKD-HD patients and matched controls are equally effective at neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection"" Objectives:1. To identify the nature, magnitude and longevity of the systemic and mucosal B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in naturally-infected or vaccinated ESKD-HD patients 2. To determine the functionality and neutralising capacity of serum and salivary antibodiesgenerated by ESKD-HD patients at different times post-vaccination/infection 3. To determine the capacity of different immune/non-immune cells from ESKD-HD patientsto resist infection in the presence or absence of antibodies From these studies, we will understand if virus-specific antibodies are friends or foes in these clinically extremely vulnerable patients and inform our approach to treatment, shielding and the benefits of vaccination.",1,1d
C15124,PanCorVac (Center for Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine Development),"SUMMARY   Most of the vaccines currently approved or in development against the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus target immunodominant, strain-specific epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2  spike (S) protein and are therefore not expected to confer protection against other coronaviruses. Accordingly,  the NIAID announced NOT-AI-21-002, which calls for the ""development of prophylactic vaccines to provide  broad and durable protection against coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2 and others with pandemic  potential"". In response to this call, we assembled the Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine (PanCoVac) consortium to  develop and test novel pan-coronavirus vaccines. Research Project 1 (RP1; Design and evaluation of pan-  CoV vaccines) uses two strategies to develop broadly protective coronavirus vaccines: (i) Focus immune  responses away from the immunodominant epitopes in the head region of S and towards the more conserved,  immune-subdominant epitopes in the stem region of S; and (ii) Refocus immune responses from the variable  immunodominant epitopes towards more conserved epitopes in the head region of S. For each strategy, several  innovative approaches will be used. Novel antigens will be presented by virus-like particles based on a self-  assembling bacteriophage coat protein (a highly immunogenic platform). The candidate vaccines will be tested  for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy against different coronaviruses in an animal model. Selected  candidates will be tested in a second animal model, and with an mRNA lipid nanoparticle platform. Additional  studies will test the durability of immune responses and the effect of vaccination on virus transmission. Samples  from vaccinated animals will be provided to Research Project 2 (RP2; Immunological responses to pan-CoV  vaccines) for a detailed assessment of B- and T-cell responses. First, RP2 will continue its ongoing efforts to  generate and characterize panels of SARS-CoV S-specific mAbs, which will be used in RP1 to help characterize  and prioritize vaccine candidates. Moreover, ""Ig-omics"", which involves single-cell technologies allowing high-  throughput analysis of B-cell responses, phenotypes, immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires and mAbs that react to  several coronaviruses (a technology developed by one of the RP2 investigators), will be used to characterize B  cell-mediated immunity and mAb specificity induced by the candidate vaccines. RP2 will also test (and compare  with data from a human cohort study) the ability of the candidate vaccines to elicit responses to cross-reactive  CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes. In particular, recently developed novel methods will be used to characterize and  compare the T-cell repertoires upon infection and vaccination. An Administrative Core will oversee and manage  all financial and administrative aspects of the consortium. Our proposed research draws strength from a multi-  institutional team of experts in molecular virology, structural biology, nanobiotechnology, and B- and T-cell  immunology.","1, 7","1d, 1e, 7a, 7l"
C20745,An accurate eukaryotic plasma membrane assay for coronavirus binding,"This project focuses on the development of a surface based ACE2 membrane sensor that will provide a highly realistic model of coronavirus cell surface binding and be amenable to high throughput screening. SARS-CoV-2 enters mammalian cells by a transduction pathway whose first stage is the interaction of its spike (S) protein on the viral surface with  ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2), a type-1 transmembrane protein. Once the virus attaches to the membrane surface the S protein is modified by a cell surface protease (TMPRSS2) to form a fusion peptide which inserts into the membrane and facilitates viral transduction. Current S protein/ACE2 interaction studies have primarily focused on utilising a recombinant soluble construct of ACE2 and thus do not truly represent the in vivo processes occurring. Using our expertise with surface based supported bilayers we will fabricate an accurate membrane mimetic of the eukaryotic membrane containing full length ACE2 on a sensor surface. Neutron Reflectometry together with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) will be used to validate the surface assemblage and viral component binding. The system will then be further developed to include other components known to be involved in ACE2/Coronavirus interaction (e.g. TMPRSS2 & B0AT1), to provide a realistic model of coronavirus membrane surface interaction. This system will be directly translatable to techniques amenable to high throughput screening (QCM and surface plasmon resonance). This will aid the scientific community in studying coronavirus membrane binding and can be used as a diagnostic tool for the identification of inhibitors of coronavirus-membrane interactions.",1,"1a, 1e"
C07394,Inflammation in Covid-19: Exploration of Critical Aspects of Pathogenesis (ICECAP),"The current coronavirus pandemic is causing significant illness and death. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) leads to acute lung damage and organ injury, often requiring intensive care admission and prolonged periods of time on a ventilator. As this disease is new, the way that the virus causes organ injury is not understood. It is therefore urgent and vital that the effects of severe Covid-19 are described to rapidly inform clinical management and identify new treatment approaches. The ICECAP consortium was established as a rapid response to the Covid-19 pandemic. By assembling a team of expert clinicians and scientists we are studying key features of fatal Covid-19. Authorised hospital post-mortem examinations of those who have died from Covid-19 provides a unique opportunity to study the whole body in a level of detail that is not possible during life. By collecting and analysing tissue samples collected during post-mortem examinations this will yield crucial information on the presence of the coronavirus in multiple organs in the body and also understand in greater depth how the body's immune system is responding.

P21479,Therapeutic efficacy of favipiravir against henipavirus infections,"ABSTRACT  Nipah and Hendra viruses are recently emerged bat-borne paramyxoviruses (genus Henipavirus) causing severe  encephalitis and respiratory disease in humans with fatality rates ranging from 40-75%. Despite the severe  pathogenicity of these viruses and their pandemic potential, no therapeutics or vaccines are currently approved  for use in humans. Favipiravir (T-705) is a purine analogue antiviral approved for use in Japan against emerging  influenza strains; and several phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are ongoing in the United States and Europe.  Previously, broad-spectrum antiviral activity of favipiravir has been demonstrated against a large number of RNA  viruses, including members of the Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, and Bunyaviridae families. With  the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, favipiravir has also been discussed as a potential antiviral drug for treatment  of mild to moderate symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and is currently tested in several clinical trials.  We were able to demonstrate that favipiravir has potent antiviral activity against henipaviruses in cell culture with  EC50's in the low micromolar range. Furthermore, we could show that treatment with favipiravir resulted in full  protection of Nipah virus-infected hamsters, suggesting that favipiravir should be further evaluated as an antiviral  treatment option for henipavirus infections. The overall goal of this application is to develop antiviral treatment  options for infections caused by henipaviruses. Our hypothesis is that favipiravir will demonstrate therapeutic  antiviral efficacy against all human pathogenic Nipah virus strains and Hendra virus in a disease-relevant and  widely accepted small animal model, will be efficacious in a post-exposure setting, and interrupt transmission.  To interrogate our driving hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Optimize the therapeutic  efficacy of favipiravir against henipavirus infection in the Syrian hamster model; and (2) Evaluate if  favipiravir can evoke extinction of Nipah virus through lethal mutagenesis. The proposed studies will  provide fundamental information for the further development of favipiravir as a broad-spectrum antiviral, and  ultimately lead to the development of countermeasures against henipavirus infections.",6,6g
C06798,Center for Modeling Complex Interactions,"Modeling efforts for COVID-19 within the US have focused primarily on helping urban centers cope with theconsequent health care crisis. The impact of the pandemic on rural communities is still emerging, and theseareas have not received the same degree of modeling attention. At the same time, rural communities aredifferent from urban centers in ways that affect the disease and its dynamics: they have lower densities, aremore isolated, have smaller social networks, tend to be poorer and older, and have scant health careinfrastructure. Rural communities are also the primary source of food production and natural resourceextraction in this country. As the pandemic unfolds across the coming months, rural communities will be facedwith highly variable circumstances: some will have no infections and be focused on early detection; some willhave active cases and be attempting to stop their spread; some will have eliminated active cases and beattempting to reopen economic and community activities while guarding against resurgence. Treating allcommunities as the same would be foolish. At the local level, decision makers need tools tailored to realcommunities: tools that emulate the way people come and go and interact there, tools to consider the mostrelevant interventions, and tools that account for real variation in how able and willing people will be to complywith possible interventions. At the larger health-district and state level, officials need forecasts of how localdecisions, health care infrastructure, and the virus itself will interact to drive the epidemic. The purpose of thecurrent proposal is to provide these tools by building a model of COVID-19 for largely rural states that links thedynamics within communities together into a statewide network. This will be achieved in three specific aims. InAim 1, we develop a predictive epidemiological model of COVID-19 spread and intensity for rural states. Thiswill be done with a spatial, age-structured metapopulation model that relies on differential equations and theirstochastic extensions. In Aim 2, we evaluate how potential interventions in individual communities affectoutbreak risk, transmission, access to health care, and intervention efficacy and adoption. Here we combinesurveys-of both rural and urban communities in Idaho and several broader regions of the US-to estimatepatterns of compliance and the motivations behind them. Using these results, we will then use agent-basedmodels of synthetic communities to simulate interventions. Net effects will be relayed up to the statewidemodel. In Aim 3, we provide support for decision making to state public health officials and local policy makersin rural communities. This will be done by developing two online graphical interfaces for visualizing forecastsand exploring interventions-one high-level application for non-specialists and a second, more sophisticatedversion, for public health professionals. Education, empowerment, and appreciation of uncertainty will beemphasized. Finally, the models and tools we develop here will be implemented in Idaho, but will be designedfor easy export to states with significant rural populations.",3. 9,"3a, 3c, 3d, 9a"

P22287,Scalable Inference in Statistical Models of Viral Evolution and Human Health,"Project Summary / Abstract  Despite global public health advances, viruses remain a major threat to human health both in the United  States and internationally. Recent and continuing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Zika, Lassa fever, and  Chikungunya, as well as persistent epidemics such as HIV have emphasized the need to understand viral  evolution and virus-host interactions during epidemics. Phylogenetic statistical models of viral evolution offer  a powerful tool for studying the interplay between viral genetics and environmental or host factors. However,  current phylogenetic models are often too inÃ¯Â¬Â'exible to realistically model these relationships, and those that  do are computationally intractable for even moderately sized data sets. This project aims to develop new  statistical models that are both Ã¯Â¬Â'exible enough to model complex biological relationships and scalable to large  data sets of viral and host traits. The Ã¯Â¬Ârst aim is to develop more efÃ¯Â¬Âcient and less biased statistical methods  for estimating the heritability of viral phenotypes (e.g. viral load, host CD4 T-cell count, replicative capacity).  Current statistical practices typically produced biased heritability estimates and are intractable for large data  sets. This project seeks to extend state-of-the-art inference techniques to model the heritability of viral pheno-  types (enabling both unbiased and efÃ¯Â¬Âcient inference) and to apply these new methods to better estimate the  heritability of viral load in HIV-1. The second aim seeks to develop statistical methods for studying complex,  high-dimensional viral phenotypes such as infection severity which cannot be captured with a single measure-  ment. These phenotypes are difÃ¯Â¬Âcult to quantify due to their inherent complexity, confounding rigorous efforts  at, say, identifying unusually virulent viral clades. While phylogenetic factor analysis enables identiÃ¯Â¬Âcation and  quantiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of high-dimensional phenotypes, it scales poorly to large data sets. We propose new inference  techniques that address these scalability problems and allow previously intractable analyses. We plan to apply  these new methods to study patterns of virulence in Ebola and Lassa fever and to identify unusually virulent  viral strains. Additionally, these methods are well suited to identifying epistatic interactions between viral mu-  tations and phenotypes of interest, and we plan to explore these interactions in HIV, Zika, and Chikungunya  viruses. The third aim is to develop new statistical models speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally designed to predict outcomes of viral  infections from viral sequence data. To accommodate the necessary Ã¯Â¬Â'exibility required by these models, we  develop new inference strategies that are both highly generalizable (i.e. they do not rely on strict assumptions  in existing models) and computationally efÃ¯Â¬Âcient. Strong predictive performance would enable researchers or  clinicians to predict clinically relevant outcomes using viral sequences, which could help inform treatment. We  will evaluate these methods using the Ebola and Lassa fever data from mentioned above.",3,3d

Individual protective equipment can be insufficiently protective, including for healthcare professionals.If this trial confirms the efficacy of either drug, a chemoprophylaxis strategy could be extended to other populations highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or at risk of severe forms of Covid-19 while waiting for other preventive tools, vaccines in particular, to become available.","4, 6","4e, 6h, 6g"

After the phase of general shut-down, efficient monitoring strategies as well as the clarification of open questions regarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the causes of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are of highest relevance. In particular, they complement the activities of the national research network and seroprevalence studies underway at numerous sites in Germany. Within the framework of an interdisciplinary project study on the epidemiological characterization of COVID-19, questions will be addressed that specifically require an interdisciplinary approach and that are not or insufficiently addressed in current, Germany-wide research projects on epidemiology and diagnostics. Against this background, COVMon will address the following questions in particular: 1. which monitoring concepts are suitable for early detection of virus spread in childcare facilities? 2. which co-infections occur in patients with severe COVID-19 infection? 3. What is the role of animals in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2? Answering these questions will make a critical contribution to our understanding of the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany and thus provide a rational basis for decisions on containment measures.","1, 2","1a, 2a"

The overall program goals are to identify the viral and host determinants, which regulate the atomic-level interactions between the SARS2 S-glycoprotein and various ACE2 receptor and associated entry components such as cellular proteases. The impact of these studies are high, as these interactions regulate 2019-nHCoV species specificity and host tropism, which play critical roles in viral pathogenesis and inform the evolutionary pathways leading to virus emergence and spread in humans and perhaps other intermediate hosts.

C19626,Development of a Microwave Enabled Bio-Nano-Microfluidic Device for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 crisis has caused over 280k deaths with more than 4 million infections as of May 8, 2020. These numbers are increasing and may peak again with reopening of businesses. This tragedy could be prevented from happening or its impact could be largely minimized if rapid, massive-scale testing can be performed at community level without the need of highly trained professionals and expensive equipment. This is also the highly recommended action among the immediate next steps by World Health Organization (WHO). The proposed project aims to develop such a system for rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of the COVID-19 virus by leveraging the team's expertise in engineering, nanotechnology, viral immunology and clinical medicine.   The proposed system is a palm-sized instrument that consists of a battery-powered microwave circuitry and a microwave-microfluidic device with its sensor surface modified by functionalized gold nanoparticles (gNPs) that specifically recognize the COVID-19 virus. The output is a yes/no answer via a light indicator. A test can be done within 30 minutes including the sample preparation, which is completed by simply stirring a nasopharyngeal swab containing a tested person's sample in a buffer solution. The system allows a test to be completed with a small drop of the sample solution (5 microliter) that is filled in the inlet reservoir and drawn to pass the detection chamber towards the outlet by capillary force. If the sample contains the COVID-19 virus, the virus will be captured by the functionalized gNPs coated on the sensor surface resulting in the change in the microwave spectrum. The microwave circuitry will analyze the spectrum and output a yes/no answer. It is expected that the availability of the proposed portable system will enable the test of COVID-19 at the community level such as at a drive-through point or in an ambulance, which will largely expand the testing capacity and thus assist in the control the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,1a
C19790,Rapid Response to Emerging Serious Pathogen Outbreaks using Next-gen Data: R2ESPOND,"A new virus has been identified from Wuhan City in China from the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), which is now responsible for more than 71,000 cases of illness (COVID-19 disease) in over 29 countries. Although there have not yet been any deaths in Canada, public health agencies are on high alert, as there is a real possibility of a serious epidemic. The WHO has declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. As of February 14th, five COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in British Columbia and based on travel patterns there is every reason to expect additional cases in BC. There are many unanswered questions regarding the virus, how it spreads and the disease that it causes. This information is needed for a data-driven response to this outbreak. We aim to use two types of next-generation data (next-gen genomics data and next-gen human data), along with a data integration tool called PLOVER 2.0, to answer these unknowns.   The research team will  1)Carry out rapid genomic sequencing on patient samples to study the virus, how it spreads, how it evolves and predict which drugs will work 2)Develop knowledge of how the virus characteristics, along with a patient's previous health conditions, impact the severity of illness and how they recover from the illness 3)Develop a software tool (PLOVER 2.0) that will allow us to carry out this research and will also make the data viewable by key stakeholders such as Medical Health Officers.   This work will not only generate critical knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus but will also help develop a better understanding of health outcomes for infected patients.

C00144,Understanding and mitigating real-time differential gendered effects of the COVID-19 outbreak,"Infectious disease outbreaks are considered by policymakers as global, collective problems, assuming a similar impact of pathogens on all people. Yet, the impact of disease on individuals and communities is not homogenous, with women disproportionately affected. The sex and gendered dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak so far are anecdotal, but the consequences of sidelining these canlimit effective responses in affected regions, as well as prevention and preparedness efforts globally. This project will conduct a gender analysis to identify and document the differential gendered effects of the outbreak and gaps in preparedness and response measures in a dynamic way, providing real time guidance and recommendations to those crafting policy and public health interventions. We will: map and analyze sex disaggregated data on COVID-19 infections and mortality to provide evidence to inform public health responses, decision-making and planning; document and analyze gender impacts of the outbreak in order to strengthen understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and communities through chatroom and social media analysis and interviews with those infected and affected; conduct gender-based analysis of national and global responses through policy analysis and key informant interviews; produce knowledge translation resources, including a gender matrix and toolkit, to improve policy and public health responses to COVID-19. Findings will contribute to the global response of COVID-19 through strengthening understanding of how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease. The COVID-19 Gender Matrix will be a living, online tool presenting gender analysis questions and data as it is gathered and serving as a template to measure gender indicators, if and where the outbreak may spread.

P23257,Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics,"PROJECT SUMMARY  When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions  that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will  there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world  instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current  methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15  West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the  2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and  prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are  typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission  mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on  the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations,  particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching  scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical  covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to  confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to  forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches;  (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making  in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory  to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop  accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics.  We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches  to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned  above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that  occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed  are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to  epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting  and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical  approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during  public health crises.",3,"3c, 3d"
P23636,Setting up a coordinated surveillance under the One Health approach,"The majority of new emerging infectious diseases that affect humans are zoonoses. The factors that drive the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases are complex and include climate-related, ecological, political, economic and social factors. Animal health, human health and the environment are interconnected, and different ecosystems across Europe are changing in different ways.There is a need for more rapid and effective responses to zoonotic diseases. This is achievable with a conceptual shift from siloed health approaches towards One Health practices across disciplines, sectors, and agencies. The surveillance on the animal health side and in the environment needs to be scaled up to set up a One Health surveillance for emerging and re-emerging pathogens. This can only be carried out by Member States that implement the Union policies at national level, but optimally in collaboration across countries, as the threats are cross-border health threats.      OH4Surveillance supports the participating countries to set up and scale up One Health surveillance to priority pathogens in an efficient, coordinated and collaborative manner. The scope of OH4Surveillance is limited to One Health surveillance aiming to protect public health through the early detection of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic pathogens in animals and environment. The setting up and scaling up activities include capacity building and surveillance activities, and is done in close collaboration with EFSA and ECDC as well as with related other projects.    OH4Surveillance supports the policy priority to be better prepared to respond to cross-border health threats.

C03098,Psychological First Aid Training to Address COVID-19 Related Stressors,"Emerging evidence tells us that the COVID-19 pandemic will have far-reaching impacts on the emotional and psychological well-being of adults and children. Recent reports also indicate that COVID-19 is likely to result in an economic recession and that the psychological and emotional effects of the pandemic for vulnerable populations - namely children and their families - will endure well beyond the virus' physical impacts. Despite the fact that there is evidence that Psychological First Aid (PFA) could minimize the emotional and psychological toll related to COVID-19, PFA training has not been a focus of the pandemic response in Canada. According to the World Health Organization, PFA is a brief-intervention that provides targeted and practical psychological support to help individuals manage distress related to large crises, such as a pandemic. PFA is widely endorsed by global public health authorities, including the WHO and the United Nations, and has been used to provide widespread psychological and emotional support to the public during extreme events (e.g., Hurricane Katrina) and other viral pandemics (e.g., the Ebola Outbreak). We have chosen to implement and evaluate a PFA training program for mental health counselors - called LIVES for Families - to see if it supports them to address COVID-19 emotional and psychological stressors experienced by caregivers and their children. Reducing the potential burden of child and family suffering attributed to COVID-19 remains a crucial public health challenge. Our work will provide information about: (a) the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the LIVES for Families PFA Training Program with mental health counselors to address COVID-19-related stressors among caregivers and their children; and (b) generate the initial research necessary to develop an evidence-based, COVID-19 PFA training program for widespread implementation and evaluation in the Canadian context.",10,10a
C15273,CRST COVID-19 - Wayakta He,"Title: CRST COVID-19 Wayakta He? (Are you on guard against COVID?) PI: E. Erdei  Project Summary   Ongoing concurrent pandemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infections and toxic exposures originated from electronic cigarette (e-cig) and secondhand smoke had taken  devastating tolls on minority communities in the U.S. Rather than being ""the great equalizer"" due to universal  lack of immunity, evidence has shown that the burden of COVID-19 disease has been disproportionately felt by  racial/ethnic minority and low-income communities. This stark and most current health disparity is likely due to  a variety of psychosocial stressors stemming from structural inequalities that place individuals of color and/or  low socioeconomic status, including American Indian/Alaska Native communities at greater risk for the  contraction of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 disease. A recent literature showed that  overall COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with youth use of e-cigarettes. However, that study did not look  specifically at younger generation of American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN), and how other factors within  tribal communities affect disease susceptibility. This proposal is submitted in response to ""Mechanism for  Time-Sensitive Research Opportunities in Environmental Health Sciences "", RFA-ES-19-011.                      Aim 1 will  employ a community-based data collection of socioeconomic and environmental stressors in the Cheyenne  River Sioux Tribal (CRST) communities in South Dakota by administering a tribal-specific survey, which will  constitute the CRST SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence collected in 300 participating CRST households with  600 distinct participants representing a wide-range of ages (18-89 yrs). The development of novel and time -  sensitive data during the ongoing CRSRT pandemic on social factors and environmental toxicants will expand  under Aim 2 by capturing detailed personal behaviors (i.e. vaping), stressors, Tribal housing, and by measuring  environmental health factors that may impact COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity and immune response.  Detailed immunological assessment (total IgA, viral-specific IgG & IgM positivities and cortisol) will be carried  out by using non-invasive saliva sampling. These measures will help us to assess the association between risk  factors from Aim 1 survey data and RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 viral infection prevalence. Based on  passive air monitoring we will be able to evaluate the association between airborne exposures to nitrogen  dioxide and airborne nicotine in the homes with increased susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infections and  increased viral-specific IgM and decreased protective IgG response. We will assist CRST COVID-19  Command Center by generating a community-driven, COVID-19 targeted, public health literacy, and by  capturing population-based infection susceptibility risks and specific immune response data. Our hypothesis is  that increased SARS-CoV-2 infections among CRST community members are associated with vaping and  indoor secondhand smoke, lower socioeconomic status, the type of heating sources used in homes, large  multigenerational households (>3.4 people in one home), and living in multi-unit Tribal housing complexes.","3, 4, ","3b, 3d, 4a, 4b, 4c"

The proposed Center will enhance and coordinate the existing resources of the five partnering institutions to advance the very strong pipeline of laboratory discoveries and technical innovations generated every year in NHLBI mission areas (over 250 NHLBI-funded projects). This application has three specifics aims: (1) To create the CCIA - a self-sustainable, multi-institutional consortium focused on translating early innovations in NHLBI mission areas into advanced solutions for improving global patient care. CCIA will complement the mission of the GCIC by reaching earlier into the discovery and development pipeline in order to address the gap between discovery research and validation/pre-clinical development. (2) To select through rigorous peer-review commercially-promising NHLBI funded projects that will receive funds and expert project management. Projects shall span the technology range of diagnostics, devices, therapeutics and tools. (3) To create a nationally accessible institute for educating and mentoring researchers, clinicians and developers in biomedical innovation and entrepreneurism. The Center will provide experience-based training to cultivate a growing cadre of commercially successful innovators.

P22504,Genetic screens to find critical host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Emerging and re-emerging viruses cause a constant threat to global health. Discovery and characterization of  cellular signaling pathways that regulate pathogenesis and host defense hold promise for revealing new  strategies aimed at enhancing resistance to infection. There are no approved antiviral therapies available for  coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that cause disease on a large scale, highlighting the need for innovative  approaches to develop more broad-spectrum antivirals. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging approach  in the field of anti-infectives. The strategy behind HDT is to interfere with host cell factors that are required by a  pathogen for replication. Recent breakthroughs in somatic cell genetics have enabled genome-scale genetic  knockout screens in human cells to identify cellular factors critical to infection and to dissect innate immune  pathways. The pooled genetic knockout approach has several key advantages. First, by using a genome-scale  CRISPR library and using pseudotyped virus for entry and a SARS-CoV-2 replicon for RNA replication and  transcription, only those genes are selected whose knockout confers a strong resistance to virus infection.  Second, because this approach relies on complete knockout of the gene of interest, we select only those genes  that affect infection without being required for cellular viability and growth. In this competitive supplement, we  propose to use these robust and unbiased knockout screening approaches to identify and thoroughly  characterize novel host targets essential for infection by SARS-CoV-2. We expect that these genome-scale  screens will elucidate promising cellular targets that could be used to develop host-directed antiviral therapy.",1,"1b, 1c"

To address these challenges, we plan to build on the unique mechanistic spatially  structured modeling approaches developed by our consortium, that includes stochastic  metapopulation models and fully developed agent-based models nested together in our global  epidemic and mobility modeling (GLEAM) approach.  The objective of this project is to generate novel and actionable scientific insights from  dynamic transmission models of influenza transmission that effectively integrate key  socio-demographic indicators of the focus population, as well as a wide spectrum of  pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our proposed work in specific aim 1  (A1) will leverage our global modeling (from the global to local scale) framework that can be used  to explore the multi-year impact of influenza vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis/treatment, and  community mitigation during influenza seasons and pandemics. Our specific aim 2 (A2) will focus  on using high quality data to model heterogeneous transmission drivers and novel contact pattern  stratifications that will allow us to guide mitigation strategies and prioritization for interventions. In  our Aim 3 (A3) we will use artificial intelligence approaches to identify interventions that are  particularly synergistic and well-suited to particular epidemic scenarios, for seasonal and  pandemic influenza. Our overarching goal is to provide a modeling portfolio with flexible and  innovative mathematical and computational approaches. We aim to address several questions  commonly asked about seasonal and pandemic influenza and match these with analytical  methods and outbreak projections. The modeling and data developed in this project can help  facilitate and justify transparent public health decisions, while contributing to the definition of  standard methods for model selection and validation. Finally, our influenza modeling platform can  also benefit the broader network of modeling teams and can be used to improve result sharing  and harmonization of modeling approaches.",3,"3a, 3c"

C01177,Gendering the UK's social policy response to the COVID-19 crisis,"The COVID-19 outbreak and resultant economic crisis have led to governments around the world, including the UK, taking extraordinary action to support citizens, many of whom are facing unprecedented shocks to their livelihoods. For example, the UK has launched the Job Retention Scheme (JRS), the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), and changes to benefits. The JRS pays workers who are not needed during the pandemic at 80% of their earnings up to £2500 per month, while the SEISS pays a taxable grant of 80% of average annual earnings for the previous three years to self-employed people earning less than £50,000 per year. The Government has also increased the support provided by existing benefits such as Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit. Bodies such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) recommend that government support should target those most affected by the economic fallout from COVID-19. Women form one of these groups - research has already shown that women in the UK are more likely than men to have become unemployed or to have reduced earnings, largely as a result of over-representation in precarious, low-paid work and shut-down economic sectors. School and nursery closures have intensified women's disproportionate responsibility for unpaid care work, and gender intersects with wider structural inequalities which place particular women - including single mothers and BAME women - at greater risk of negative economic consequences.  To mitigate these impacts and ensure a gender-sensitive recovery from the crisis, there is an urgent need for gendered perspectives to be built into emergency and long-term social policy responses. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge on how this can successfully be done. To fill this gap in knowledge, our project explores whether the current UK social policy response is gender-sensitive in design, access, and impacts. We do this by (1) documenting and comparing social policy responses around the world to investigate whether the response in the UK is more or less gender-sensitive than that of other countries (2) assessing the reach of UK government social support to different groups through a gendered analysis of uptake and (3) exploring the impact of different policy approaches on longer-term indicators of gender inequalities through and after the crisis. The project will highlight the policy options that are most likely to mitigate gendered economic and social risks in the short and longer term and promote the most gender-equitable recovery from the crisis.","9, 10","9e, 10b"

C20494,Examining quality of life among those with adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced unprecedented levels of stress into the realities of daily living. Many of these stressors, such as job loss and quarantine practices, are of a non-traumatic nature. However, due to threats such as loss of life, some may experience stress of a traumatic nature. The traumatic nature of such high-intensity stressors has the potential to influence the onset of pandemic-related mental health disorders such as adjustment disorders (AD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in some portions of the population. Because the onset of pandemic-related AD and PTSD are relatively new phenomena, little is known about the impacts of these disorders on reported quality of life (QOL) within this context. Thus, it is crucial to further investigate QOL outcomes in relation to pandemic-related AD and PTSD to first foster a greater understanding of the implications of stressor-induced mental health disorders on QOL and to then inform the development of effective interventions for future similar events. This study first seeks to accomplish these goals through the direct administration of a diagnostic tool and self-report quality of life measure to a sample of 200 Canadians. The results of this data collection will be analyzed in a variety of contexts to examine for relationships and differences between QOL outcomes in those with no diagnosis versus those with diagnosable AD or PTSD. Additionally, analyses will examine if these groups report significant differences in any of the four major facets of QOL (physical health, psychological, social relationships, environment). Results of this study will provide a relevant insight into the implications of a mental health disorder on QOL outcomes in the context of a mass-stressor event such as a pandemic. ",10,10a

Some are world famous, attracting big annual footfall; some are run on a shoestring by small groups of volunteers. All will have been profoundly impacted by Covid-19, in ways unique to the sector. Most will have tried to develop new ways of engaging with the public during lockdown and the subsequent restrictions. The impact of the pandemic and the responses to it remain unknown, unquantified, and unanalysed.    The UK's literary heritage sites include museums dedicated to globally renowned household names such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, and Burns, as well as to underappreciated national treasures such as Laurence Sterne, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Horace Walpole. The challenges faced by the literary heritage sector during Covid-19 are different from those faced by other museums, stately homes, and heritage sites, and there is reason to believe that the sector has been hit particularly badly by Covid-19 issues, with several key sites ineligible for or unsuccessful in securing financial support from government.

C00159,A comprehensive study of immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection',"Since December 2019 the emergence of severe acute respiratory infections (COVID-19) in China, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has posed a huge threat to global health with fatality rates up to 10% in elderly patients. Almost 100% of patients showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in their lungs by chest CT scans indicating acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism(s) of ALI induced by SARS-CoV-2 is very important to inform vaccine safety and immunotherapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we will investigate the host immune responses and their association with severity of ALI in patient samples and animal models. We will bring together a team of experts with complementary expertise including immunopathology in coronavirus infections, up-to-date lab technologies, and know-how to ensure the feasibility of this study with the following goals: 1)    defining SARS-CoV-2 specific serum profiles (epitopes) using yeast display antigen library 2)    determining antibody functions including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) vs neutralizing activities in vitro assays 3)    studying T cell (CD4 and CD8) responses to whole SARS-CoV-2 genome 4)    evaluating ALI in response to live SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without passive immunity (antibody or T cells) generated from vaccine candidates in a humanized mice model.",1,1d
P22686,Defining the Role of the Plasminogen Activator Protease in the Early Events that Establish Primary Pneumonic Plague,"Project Summary  Pneumonic plague is the deadliest form of disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Early after infection, Y. pestis  subverts host innate immune mechanisms in the lung and replicates to high numbers before the onset of lethal  host inflammatory responses. As a result, pneumonic plague is difficult to treat once symptoms are recognized.  This proposal introduces the Yersinia Plasminogen activator protease (Pla) as an important mediator of early  host/pathogen interactions in the lung. Pla is well-established virulence factor known to be essential to the  pathogenesis of pneumonic plague via an unknown function. The work proposed here examines the dual role of  Pla, as both an adhesin and a protease, during pulmonary infection. The objective of this work is to define the  function of the critical Yersinia virulence factor Pla in the early events of pneumonic plague to understand how  Y. pestis resists clearance by host inflammatory responses to establish an initial replicative phase in the lungs.  The strategy for this proposal is outlined below:  Specific Aim 1. Define the role of Pla-mediated T3S during pneumonic plague. The adhesin function of Pla  facilitates targeting of alveolar macrophages for type 3 secretion (T3S) early during pneumonic plague. Aim 1  will generate and test mutants of Pla to understand how Pla mediates adherence, and characterize the  importance of Pla-mediated adherence and T3S in vivo. Further, the impact of Pla-mediated T3S on host cell  innate immune responses to T3S will be evaluated during infection to understand how Y. pestis limits host  responsiveness early during infection.  Specific Aim 2. Characterize novel proteolytic functions of Pla during pneumonic plague. Preliminary data  has identified two novel functions of Pla that may contribute to pathogenesis. A proteomics approach will be  used to identify and characterize Pla proteolytic activity early during primary pneumonic plague.  Specific Aim 3. Identify key host cell types and dynamics responsible for establishing an early pre-  inflammatory disease phase during pneumonic plague. Preliminary data indicates that deletion of Pla  disrupts the ability of Y. pestis to limit early innate immune responses in the lung. In Aim 3 we will evaluate host  cell dynamics and innate immune responses in the lung in the presence and absence of Pla to understand how  Y. pestis is able to subvert initial inflammatory responses and establish infection in the lung.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"

C15116,Project 4: Computational panbetaCoV immunogen design,"Abstract - Project 4  SARS-CoV-2, a member of the genus Betacoronavirus (betaCoV), is the third major zoonotic outbreak of a highly  pathogenic betaCoV in the last two decades. We propose to design vaccines to contribute to the global effort to  counter the COVID-19 pandemic as swiftly as possible, and then to build on these designs to create panbetaCoV  vaccines that could be used to rapidly contain outbreaks of future coronavirus zoonoses. To these ends, we will  design both 1) Spike-targeted antibody vaccines, mindful of SARS-CoV-2 evolution as the pandemic progresses,  and 2) conserved-region T-cell vaccine designs, to refocus CD8 T-cell response to regions in the proteome that  cannot escape without a high fitness cost. These efforts toward pandemic vaccines will then be used as a  foundation to extend our vaccine design strategies to counter the variability found among BetaCoVs, the highly  diverse genus of CoVs that are found in bat populations. Based on our preliminary explorations of BetaCoV  sequence diversity, we expect the design of a trivalent Spike-based vaccine using computational/bioinformatic  and structure-based strategies to provide protection against the known range of diversity found in the subgenus  Sarbecovirus. This includes both SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and the many related viruses isolated from bats  and pangolins. If successful, these designs will be extended to cover Merbecovirus the subgenus that includes  the MERS virus and other related viruses found in wild bats, rodents and cattle. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1.  Track the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim 2. Design Spike vaccine antigens  that optimize epitope exposure and betaCoV diversity coverage. Aim 3. Design T cell vaccines utilizing the most  conserved regions in betaCoV. Our Spike-based computational vaccine designs will be based on our structural  B cell mosaics strategy, and will be informed by Spike glycoprotein structures and molecular dynamic modeling,  and will incorporate alignments of diverse Spike proteins. Using this approach we will design a trivalent set of  complementary of proteins that optimally covers the natural diversity found among Sarbecoviruses in the bat  reservoir. As we cannot predict with certainty the antigenic profile of viruses that may give rise to future zoonoses,  we propose a two-pronged approach, and will simultaneously explore a conserved-region T-cell strategy that,  although it might not block infection, could substantially mitigate disease, reducing both morbidity and  transmission. Our T-cell vaccine designs will optimize the coverage of linear epitopes among BetaCoVs with a  trivalent vaccine mix using our computational design strategy called Epigraphs. By focusing on the most  conserved regions in the betaCoV proteome, we can more readily cover the broad spectrum of BetaCoVs  diversity than in the more diverse Spike.",7,7a
P22054,Anti-flavivirus B cell response analysis to aid vaccine design,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of flavivirus family that emerged as an infectious agent causing  global health crisis during recent epidemics. ZIKV infection can cause Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome  in adults, and severe fetal neuromalformations and fetal death during pregnancy. ZIKV infection  is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, while sexual transmission and vertical transmission from  infected pregnant women to fetus also contribute to the recent epidemic. Ideally, an effective ZIKV  vaccine should provide sterilizing immunity that blocks the initial viral dissemination to prevent  subsequent infection-caused morbidity. Currently, there is no approved ZIKV vaccine for disease  prevention. The membrane (M) and envelope protein (E) expressed as prM-E form is a common  antigen choice for current vaccine candidates against ZIKV, as neutralizing antibodies (nAb)  against prM-E can prevent viral entry. However, such nascent PrM-E based ZIKV vaccines can  increase the infectiousness of the dengue virus (DENV), another flavivirus of which endemic area  largely overlaps with ZIKV. Due to the high degree of sequence homology between the E proteins  of ZIKV and DENV, the ZIKV prM-E vaccine may stimulate the production of antibodies that are  non-neutralizing but cross-reactive with the DENV E protein. In the event of a subsequent dengue  virus infection, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) can occur when the suboptimal anti-  ZIKV antibodies bind to the DENV virus, which thereby enhance the entry of DENV into host cells  and exacerbate dengue symptoms. Strategies to prevent the induction of ADE-prone antibodies  have been described recently for modified ZIKV immunogens, which unfortunately display  suboptimal protection efficacy in small animals. Here, we focus on applying structure-based  vaccine design to develop novel vaccine candidates with improved immunogenicity and reduced  ADE potential for DENV infection. In preliminary study, our lead vaccine candidate formulated in  optimized adjuvant showed nearly complete protection in immune mice challenged with ZIKV,  and abolished ADE potential assessed by in vitro assays. Potent monoclonal ZIKV nAbs targeting  the major ZIKV E protein nAb determinants including the quaternary E-dimer dependent epitope  isolated from immune mice confirmed the design rationale. In this application, we will extend our  effort via further immunogen designs guided by B cell/antibody response analysis and structural  investigation of ZIKV E protein-antibody interactions to improve our lead vaccine candidate aiming  at achieving sterilizing immunity, to evaluate in small animal models. If succeeds, this study will  contribute to (i) the development of an effective and safe ZIKV vaccine, and (ii) deepening our  understanding of immune response to flavivirus infections and immunizations.",7,7a

P21331,Soil survival and re-emergence: the continued threat of plague,"Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) the bacterium responsible for plague, is probably the most devastating infectious diseases known to humanity and may be responsible for more human deaths than any other micro-organism in history (e.g. during the Black Death). Its 'success' is attributed to the fact that it is extremely contagious, and when untreated, death normally occurs in 1-2 days from bubonic, pneumonic or septicaemic plague. Rodents, fleas and person to person pneumonic transmission are generally considered as fundamental to its rapid spread and although elegant, several facts are inconsistent with this hugely oversimplified model. For example, it is clear that plague can vanish from an epidemic area, only to undergo a resurgence, months or often decades after the original outbreak ceased. Where plague resides during these periods of absence from host and vector populations, and what causes it to re-emerge, has not been studied in detail. Some Y. pestis strains have now acquired multi-antibiotic resistance and an upsurge in transmission of these strains would pose a severe risk to human health, so we need to understand the conditions that might cause a significant re-emergence event to occur.  Y. pestis evolved from a near identical, free-living soil-borne ancestor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and soil is therefore thought to be a reservoir for Y. pestis, but how it survives in, and then spreads from this environment has not been adequately investigated. Y. pestis may be protected during this soil stage of its life cycle by embedding in a self-derived protective 'slime' layer (biofilm) enabling the bacterial cells to form a protected association with other bacteria, amoebae or nematodes in the soil.   In this study we focus on soil as the important environmental reservoir in which Y. pestis adopts a 'sit and wait' survival lifestyle from where it can re-enter the rodent/human population when conditions are favorable. We aim to identify the environmental and biological triggers that underpin plague survival in, and re-emergence from, soil. To do this we need to take a wide view of the soil environment including factors such as microclimate, soil type, and land cover in association with testing the impact of nematode worms and amoebae on plague survival. Our work will plug a significant and potentially dangerous gap in our understanding of plague ecology, especially important given that the World Health Organization has recently classified Y. pestis as a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen.  Using Madagascar as our case study, due to its well recorded plague outbreak history, we will address this knowledge gap using a wide range of scientific approaches. We will use computer based modeling techniques to enable us to predict how plague remains silent for long periods before re-emerging as a new disease outbreak. The model inputs will be obtained by measuring rodent burrow temperatures, humidity and local climate conditions in Madagascar, in conjunction with climate, land cover and soil-type datasets. The models will also use data from Y. pestis soil survival experiments which we will obtain under controlled laboratory conditions. We will also use genetic sequencing techniques to investigate the bacterial soil populations that co-habit with Y. pestis as well as uncovering the genes in Y. pestis that are responsible for soil survival.  Our data will aid the implementation of surveillance strategies, and identification of the environmental signposts that can predict plague outbreaks, both in Madagascar, and by inference in other plague endemic parts of the world, as well as providing information about plague persistence, spread and therefore potential control measures either before or following a resurgent outbreak.",1,1f
C19477,Probing the molecular basis of translation-replication switching in pathogenic RNA viruses,"Viruses that use a single strand of positive sense RNA (+ssRNA) as their genomes number a breadth of human pathogens including Zika virus (flavivirus), poliovirus (picornavirus), norovirus (calicivirus) and SARS-CoV2 (coronavirus). A number of key, fundamental questions regarding how these viruses regulate usage of their genomes remain. Answering these questions not only provides new biological insights into host-pathogen interactions but could prove critical in identifying new strategies for control. These viruses use the same molecule of RNA for protein expression and as a template for replication. However, these processes occur in opposing directions i.e. translation in a 5′-3′ direction and replication in a 3′-5′ direction. This therefore necessitates a ""lifestyle switch"" for any single RNA molecule in a cell, the details of which are unknown. We will use a multidisciplinary approach including in vitro reconstitution, cell biology and infection studies to determine how lifestyle switching of genome usage is regulated during infection by +ssRNA viruses. This work will lead to a new paradigm in our understanding of the evolution of genome organisation and function in an important class of pathogenic viruses.",1,1b

The Emoticon project will provide new computational tools for assessing and altering the dynamics of emotional and behavioral contagion during public health crises. Our team has already published computational models with the ability to simulate the effect of disease contagion threats on the attitudes and behaviors of human populations. Simulated agents have cognitive architectures and weighted social network ties that affect beliefs and behaviors based on social psychological theories such as 'terror management theory.' They have been empirically validated in relation to real world data. We will adapt these models to simulate the social contagion effects of disease contagion threats under a wide variety of parameters, including those of poorer countries. This will provide stakeholders with an empirically validated 'artificial society' that can serve as a simulation platform within which they can experiment with intervention strategies designed to mitigate the spread of anxiety, stigma, and misinformation during the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.",9,9c

This places gig courier workers in a unique position to become infected with COVID-19 and transmit it to others as they move people, food and packages from one location to another. Although gig couriers are key vectors between where people live (e.g. homes, care facilities) and the outside world, formal strategies do not exist to protect them from exposure and to mitigate their role in disease transmission. Importantly, this risk is not expected to change anytime soon as the high use of couriers will likely not decline as the economy re-opens.  This study will contribute to coronavirus containment strategies by identifying disease transmission risks embedded in gig work contexts and practices, developing clear and tailored interventions for gig courier workers about gig courier disease-related safety and transmission, and widely disseminating results, in live time, as they are identified.  Using framework analysis explicitly geared towards generating policy- and practice-orientated findings within limited time periods, we will: document existing courier safety organisational policy; map gig courier worker work, disease exposure and transmission conditions (with attention to gendered dimensions) via social media forums and in-depth interviews with workers and courier firm representatives; and categorise disease transmission risks.

The development of a ""universal"" coronavirus (CoV)vaccine would not only be effective against COVID-19 but, in theory, would protect against future,potential pandemic CoV strains. The pathway to such a vaccine will likely focus on the design of novelimmunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to conserved viral epitopes, such as the receptorbinding site (RBS). Here we leverage our structure-based, ""resurfacing"" and glycan engineeringimmunogen design approaches for a universal influenza vaccine and extend it to COVID-19. Our ongoingstudies for influenza demonstrate that our resurfaced, heterochimeric immunogen approach substantiallyincreased the overall frequency of elicited RBS-directed responses and our glycan engineering approachcould effectively focus the immune response to a novel, conserved influenza hemagglutinin epitope; weenvision that implementing comparable immunogen design approaches for COVID-19 specificallyfocusing to its receptor-binding interface epitope would yield similar results.

C03791,Influence of NSAIDs and AERD on the expression and function of ACE2 - implications for SARS-CoV2 severity,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT SARS-CoV2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to bind to host nasal epithelial cells.However, upon binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2, internalization leads to decreased ACE2 activity. ACE2 cangenerate biologically active peptides (Ang(1-9) and Ang(1-7)) which are protective against severe COVID-19-induced lung injury. Therefore, although ACE2 expression in the nasal epithelium is a required entry point for viralinfection, continued high levels of ACE2 activity may paradoxically provide benefit once the patient is infected. Thehost factors that regulate ACE2 expression and activity are not fully known and are missing pieces required toexpand our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In March 2020 a French health minister suggested that NSAID use might be associated with more severedisease presentation in patients with COVID-19. There is now a desperate attempt to understand whetherNSAID use is simply correlated with, or actually causative of, worsened respiratory outcomes. As fever andmyalgias are associated with COVID-19, and both are often treated presumptively with NSAIDs, it is imperativethat we understand the immunological influence of NSAIDs in this disease. There is also considerable concern regarding the potential for more severe COVID-19-related respiratorydisease in patients with Type 2 inflammation, and the subset of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratorydisease (AERD) have severe upper respiratory inflammation in exactly the anatomic areas of the sinuseswhere ACE2 expression has been found to be the highest. It is not yet known how the presence of chronicType 2-driven respiratory inflammation affects ACE2 levels in the respiratory tract or the blood. We have collected nasal epithelial cells (for mRNA assessment of ACE2 expression), and both nasal fluidand serum and plasma (for ELISA measurement of the angiotensin-derived peptides as above) which arebanked and are available for immediate analysis. With these, we aim to shed light on two questions that areplaguing the assessment and treatment of patients with COVID-19: 1) Does use of NSAIDs increase risk of severe complications from COVID-19? 2) Are patients with asthma and Type 2 respiratory inflammation at increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19?Completion of these aims would allow us to make recommendations regarding safety of NSAID use inCOVID-19. Many patients are currently choosing to stop their regularly prescribed aspirin and NSAIDs out offear, which we suspect is unfounded. We will also further understand whether patients with severe Type 2respiratory inflammation have different nasal ACE2 expression and angiotensin peptide levels, compared tohealthy controls, which would suggest a differing risk of severe COVID-19 in those patients.","1, 4","1b, 4a, 4b"

P22648,Microbiome targeted oral butyrate therapy in Gulf War multisymptom illness,"Project Summary/Abstract: Gulf War Illness (GWI) continues to plague a subsection of the veterans deployed  in the Persian Gulf war even 30 years after they returned home. The illness has taken a heavy toll on the overall  quality of life of our deployed veterans. We still do not have a definitive treatment regimen for Gulf War Illness  even though several drug candidates have shown promise. Recent research in the last five years have revealed  the role of host gut microbiome in gastrointestinal disturbance, systemic inflammation and neurotrophic  abnormalities in Gulf War Illness mouse models. A recent study from our laboratory and our collaborators at  Boston University showed that veterans with GWI exhibit microbial dysbiosis with decreased butyrogenic  bacterial profile. We have preliminary data that the host virome signature is altered in GWI veterans. In addition,  we showed that gut virome alteration in a mouse model of GWI is strongly associated with increased serum  levels of IL6, a proinflammatory cytokine known to cause systemic and neurocognitive disease. Results showed  that short chain fatty acids such as butyrate restored healthy microbiome, improved microbial metabolism in the  gut apart from attenuating GWI symptom persistence in preclinical studies. Butyrate, a nutraceutical that is  endogenously produced in the host gut following bacterial fermentation also has shown promise in  gastrointestinal disturbances such as IBS and IBD and is a good treatment choice among gastroenterologists.  Butyrate is also effective as a strong anti-inflammatory molecule in preclinical studies. The FDA has long  approved the use of butyrate as a safe food additive and use of it as enemas for GI disturbances. Interestingly,  Gulf War Illness patients show gastrointestinal disturbances (constipation, diarrhea, bloating, acid reflux, pain),  chronic fatigue and neurocognitive abnormalities. The GWI patients also have an altered microbiome that is  associated with systemic inflammation.  Objective of the trial: The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if a Butyrate formulation that consists of butyric  acid as calcium and magnesium derivatives in a single oral capsule administered twice a day is effective in  increasing physical functioning for Veterans with Gulf War Illness. The secondary outcome will focus on the  drug's role in (a) restoring gut microbiome and virome (that have been found altered in GWI veterans),  (b) decreasing gastrointestinal disturbances (constipation, diarrhea, pain) (c) decreasing chronic fatigue,  (d) decreasing systemic inflammation such a blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines and (d) a  decrease in cognitive deficits. The clinical trial involving butyrate on Gulf War Illness veterans will be  conducted in three sites across the nation. The sites of Columbia SC (primary-Columbia VA medical center),  Salt Lake City, Utah and Miami VA will work in tandem and in total concert to conduct this trial. This is a  randomized, two group, double blind, placebo controlled, Phase II clinical trial. The treatment group will  receive microencapsulated butyrate capsules (600 mg twice a day for 18 weeks). The placebo group will  receive matching placebo formulation twice a day for 18 weeks. The primary outcome measure for this clinical  trial is a change from baseline of VSF-36Ã¢Â""Â¢ and CVLT II test scores, with respect to physical and mental  functioning and symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline of host-  microbiome signature, intestinal permeability assessment, peripheral pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and of  GWI-associated symptoms IBS, chronic pain, fatigue, sleep issues, and cognitive impairment.  Study Team: The 4 year clinical study will be carried out in three VAMCs and will be led by Dr.  Saurabh Chatterjee, Ph.D who has expertise on GWI , gut microbiome and butyrate pharmacology.

C00076,"Chinese and non- Chinese Canadians Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Interrelations between Risk Perception, Discrimination, and Preventative Health Actions","The coronavirus (COVID-19) has triggered fear worldwide, and in Canada, some of this fear has been misplaced onto Chinese Canadians. The proposed research program is broadly concerned with Chinese Canadians' experiences of discrimination and stigmatization in the current context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Central to these experiences, we suggest, is non-Chinese Canadians' understanding of risk and the cultural dimensions of preventative health practices. The research program has three interrelated components that, together, will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how Chinese and non-Chinese Canadians understand, experience, and react to the COVID-19, and have implications for developing strategies to combat stigma and fear associated with Chinese people and COVID-19. The first study involves a longitudinal study of Chinese Canadians' experiences of discrimination during the COVID-19 epidemic will help determine what kinds of support Chinese Canadians would like to receive now and in the near future. The second study focuses on non-Chinese Canadians' perceptions of risk associated with virus transmission. This study will test the idea that one way to allay fears aroused by viral outbreaks is to provide people with accurate numerical information about the mortality rate produced by the virus, and its main implication that reducing fear may decrease discrimination against Chinese Canadians. Risk perceptions also predict preventative behaviour. Thus, the third study focuses on wearing a face mask in public as a preventative health practice that is particularly enmeshed in cultural beliefs that differ across the two communities Together, these three interrelated components represent significant social countermeasure research to combat the intergroup threat driven by misinformation, stigma, and cultural misunderstanding associated with COVID-19.",9,"9a, 9c"

P22294,A vertebrate model of viral and hereditary microcephaly,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Microcephaly, in which head and brain development are severely inhibited, can result in extreme intellectual  disability. Microcephaly has many different causes, including gene mutation, pathogen infection and chemical  exposure. While the causes of microcephaly may be broad, there may be shared molecular mechanisms  involved. Recently published results show how Zika virus non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) inhibits brain  development in fruit flies by inhibiting the same ANKLE2 protein whose function is disrupted by gene mutation  in a hereditary form of microcephaly. This suggests that there may be key similarities in the molecular  mechanisms contributing to a viral and hereditary form of microcephaly. Studying these molecular similarities in  vertebrate models is essential to understanding disease in humans since vertebrates have different brain  structure and genes that regulate brain development. However, the tools to study this, namely a strong vertebrate  model system, do not exist.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to fill these major gaps in knowledge by developing a vertebrate  model of viral and hereditary microcephaly acting through the ANKLE2 pathway. For the hereditary model,  ankle2 will be mutated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. For the viral model, Zika virus NS4A protein will be  expressed using Tol2 transgenesis. Defects in development, including various externally measured morphology  metrics, brain size, structure and cellular defects in proliferation and survival will be assayed using anatomical  measurement and immunofluorescence microscopy. When completed, this new model system will lay the  foundation for a molecular and cellular level understanding of ANKLE2 function during vertebrate brain  development and how it is disrupted by gene mutation and viral infection. In the long-term, it will enable high-  throughput screening of chemical sensitizers and inhibitors of microcephaly, allow the exploration vertebrate-  specific mechanisms of brain development in vivo, and behavioral studies.",1,"1b, 1c, 1e"

P23446,Biomarker and AI-supported FX06 therapy to prevent progression from mild and moderate to severe stages of COVID-19,"More than 2.7 million hospitalisations of COVID-19-infected patients have occurred in Europe alone since the outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020. An average 14% of those patients with mild or moderate illness develop severe symptoms and are eventually admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The most common treatment of patients in the first two stages of the illness, such as remdesivir and antibody therapies, have neither shown the desired effect nor prevented the progression of the disease to severe and critical stages of the illness.     Interventions against SARS-CoV-2 are in high need to prevent admissions to ICUs, and would reduce the burden on patients and their families, clinical staff and the healthcare sector. Additionally, such interventions would help to provide ICU beds for non-Covid patients requiring immediate interventions, such as for heart or cancer surgery, both of which are often in need of planned free ICU beds.      In COVend, our multidsciplinary consortium will deliver a new effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2 for the clinical management of the COVID-19 disease during mild and moderate stages, including for the prevention of disease progression to severe illness. This will be achieved by advancing a promising therapeutic candidate, FX06, from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 to TRL9 through a multi-centre phase II/III clinical trial. COVend will study the influence of COVID-19 on endothelial cells (ECs) and the potential protective effect of FX06, and will apply -omics technologies, generate new algorithms and open-source software to carry out data analytics and modelling, and will develop health economic models to assess the socio-economic benefits and cost effectiveness of the new therapy.

P23331,Addressing COVID-19-related vulnerabilities for migrant returnees in Central America'Äôs Northern Triangle,"Central America'Äôs Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) is well known for its high rates of violence and poverty, correlated with high rates of migration under vulnerable conditions. Recent shifts in migration policy, particularly in the USA, have contributed to a mass return of Central Americans. The COVID-19 crisis has further aggravated the invisibility and vulnerability of these returnees (particularly youth and women) and has exposed their dire economic and security conditions amidst the pandemic. These include growing rates of gender-based violence, difficulties accessing economic opportunities, and poor access to basic services and information, both in quarantine centres and upon their reintegration into host communities.     This project seeks to promote efficient policy responses by identifying and addressing the labour reintegration and gender-based violence challenges and experiences faced by migrant returnees in the Northern Triangle with an emphasis on female and youth returnees. It will also examine the different vulnerabilities that COVID-19 imposes in these contexts. A diagnosis of returnees'Äô economic and security vulnerabilities will be conducted in six communities across the Northern Triangle, involving surveys and interviews with migrants, local organizations, and public officials. It will evaluate the most effective short and medium-term responses required to meet the economic and human security needs of these returnees.

Specifically, these measures include expanding the opioid agonist treatment (OAT) prescription guidelines and pandemic prescribing of pharmaceuticals (e.g. opioids) to people who use illicit drugs. By providing pharmaceutical alternatives to the toxic illicit drug supply, the interventions are intended to reduce physical encounters involved in obtaining illicit drugs and the use of toxic street drugs, thereby supporting both overdose and COVID-19 prevention efforts. To date, however, the impacts of these interventions have not been evaluated.    The proposed BC-based research aims to fill critical knowledge gaps by examining the reach and preliminary impacts of pandemic prescribing and expanded OAT prescription services among people who use opioids in urban Vancouver.

C06326,Modulation of ACE2 in experimental hypertension and in response to treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs: potential implications on the severity and therapeutic targets of COVID-19,"Clinical evidence indicates that hypertensive patients are highly susceptible to infection and to the severity of COVID-19, a disease caused by the new SARS coronavirus SARS-Cov-2. SARS-Cov-2 requires activation of viral S protein by serineprotease TMPRSS2 and subsequent binding of active S protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) to gain access to lung, heart and kidney cells, among others, in which ECA2 is expressed. ECA2, however, is a crucial enzyme component of the renin angiotensin system (SARS). ACE2 degrades angiotensin II (Ang II), a peptide with multiple actions that can lead to the development of arterial hypertension, and generates angiotensin-1-7 (Ang-1-7), which antagonizes the effects of Ang II. Besides that, experimental and clinical studies suggest that blockade of SARS by ACE inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and type 1 angiotensin II (ARB) antagonists may increase the abundance of ACE2. Due to the fact that patients with arterial hypertension, among other cardiovascular diseases, are routinely treated with SARS blockers, a number of clinical concerns have arisen regarding the potential increased risk of these patients being infected with SARS-Cov-2. Notably, there are no studies in experimental or human models that have examined the effects of ACEI and ARB on protein abundance and ECA2 activity in the lungs, a possible route of infection. In addition, the effects of ACEI and BRA on the modulation of the serine protease TMPRSS2 in arterial hypertension are totally unknown. Furthermore, there is no information available in the literature to show that hypertension per se or male gender, factors that contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19, modulate TMPRSS2. The present study was designed with the purpose of providing scientific evidence on the modulation of circulating and tissue ACE2 in experimental arterial hypertension and in response to ACEI and BRA, in addition to examining the potential involvement of differences between genders. The influence of RAS block, arterial hypertension and sex on the modulation of TMPRSS2 will also be elucidated.

P22392,Integrating innate and adaptive pathways in vaccine responses,"ABSTRACT Ã¢Â€Â"" Overall  Significant progress in basic immunology research over the last three decades has resulted in numerous medical  advances and dissected the general mechanisms by which the human immune system responds to foreign  antigens. However, a much more substantial understanding of the coordinated molecular mechanisms involved  in eliciting immunity will be required, as each viral pathogen poses unique challenges to the immune system and  the elicited immune responses are characterized by substantial heterogeneity that impacts disease susceptibility  and pathogenesis. Indeed, it is expected that B-cell responses against diverse viral pathogens are uniquely  evolved during infection to shape the functional activity of IgG antibodies. Studies from viral infectious diseases  have shown that antiviral IgG antibodies have the capacity to mediate a wide spectrum of opposing functions: (i)  protective functions, including neutralization, viral opsonization, and clearance of infected cells and (ii)  pathogenic activities, which enhance viral infectivity, disease susceptibility and severity; a phenomenon termed  as antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of disease. ADE mechanisms have been previously suggested to  account for susceptibility to dengue disease, as epidemiological data support that prior flavivirus infection is the  major risk factor for dengue disease, implicating the presence of cross-reactive, non-neutralizing IgG antibodies  to this process. Understanding the heterogeneity of IgG responses elicited upon infection or vaccination with  diverse viral antigens is therefore critical for characterizing the immunological mechanisms that drive human  immunity and determine the protective vs. pathogenic activity of IgG antibodies. Our Center will feature three  Projects directed by Drs. Ravetch (Project 1: Fc domain effector activity in dengue disease), Nussenzweig and  Rice (Project 2: Understanding B cell memory in response to diverse virus infections), and Wang (Project 3:  Immunity to dengue viruses), supported by a scientific core (Core A: Transgenic mouse core) and the  administrative core (Core B). Through a series of collaborative studies between the three Projects, our Center  aims to study human antiviral immune responses during infection and vaccination and characterize the immune  mechanisms that regulate the function of IgG antibodies in humans. More specifically, we aim to characterize  the heterogeneity of IgG responses elicited upon vaccination or infection with diverse viral pathogens, including  HBV and flaviviruses, like Zika and dengue. Additionally, we will dissect the ADE mechanisms by which IgG  antibodies mediate disease-enhancing activities and contribute to dengue disease susceptibility and  pathogenesis. These studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms that drive protective immunity and  modulate antibody function, having a broader impact on the development of vaccination strategies against  infectious pathogens.","1, 7","1d, 7l"
C03908,Comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies in human milk to determine their potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic and as a means to prevent infection of breastfed babies,"Project Summary SARS-CoV-2, commonly termed COVID-19 for the illness it causes, has infected >4.1 million people,including >240,000 deaths. Though COVID-19 pathology in children is believed to be relatively mild comparedto adults, approximately 10% of infants experience severe COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care, andrecently, a possible link has been reported between COVID-19 and a serious inflammatory disease recentlytermed ""Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Associated with COVID-19"" (1-4).Furthermore, as COVID-19 symptoms do not appear to correlate with transmissibility, infants and youngchildren are likely responsible for a significant amount of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination (5-7). Clearly, protectingthis population from infection remains essential. One potential mechanism of protection in babies is the passiveimmunity provided through breastfeeding by a previously-infected mother, and if the SARS-CoV-2 antibody(Ab) response in milk is potent, these Abs may be highly beneficial as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These milk Absmay be effective in treating COVID-19 by providing secretory (s) IgA and sIgM Abs, the major Ab componentsin milk. Abs of the s class are resistant to proteolytic degradation and likely highly functional in respiratorytissue (2, 6). Nearly all sIgA/sIgM in milk is derived from the mucosal immune system, including the respiratorytract; therefore, we should expect a SARS-CoV-2-reactive sIgA/sIgM response, though the magnitude,functionality, and durability of this response remains unknown. As such, SARS-CoV-2-reactive milk Abs mustbe comprehensively studied for their potential therapeutic and protective efficacy. Towards that aim, we haverecruited over 1600 lactating participants, including over 600 who have recovered from COVID-19 illness. Ourpilot data using 15 samples found 93% obtained post-COVID-19 contain SARS-CoV-2-reactive sIgA Abs.Based on this early evidence, our proposed project intends to: (a) Measure the SARS-CoV-2-reactive Abs inmilk following infection and the long-term durability of this response; (b) Determine the neutralization capacityof these Abs; and (c) Evaluate the non-neutralizing, Fc-mediated functionality of these Abs. Thiscomprehensive research will determine if COVID19-specific Abs in milk have protective biologic functions andshould be considered as a source of therapeutic Abs. These data would provide a foundation for 'convalescentmilk Ab' efficacy studies, and have implications beyond the pandemic, serving to fill a relatively largeknowledge gap regarding human milk immunology.",1,1d

P22050,ADAR1-mediated antiviral response in Zika virus (ZIKV) infection,"Project Summary  In response to viral infections, host cells trigger an innate/anti-viral immune response,  predominantly by producing the interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These anti-  viral responses promote inflammation, immune cell activation, and viral clearance. We recently  reported that retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal vascular or choroidal endothelium are  highly permissive to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and elicit antiviral response with increased  production of IFNs and ISGs. The transcriptomic analysis of ZIKV-infected RPE revealed the  induction of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA1 (ADAR1), a potent ISG, which can exert pro-  or antiviral activity by A-to-I editing of the host and viral RNA. The role and mechanisms of action  of ADAR1 during ZIKV and related flaviviruses have not been studied till now. Our preliminary  studies show that 1) ADAR1 is up-regulated at the transcript, as well as, protein levels upon ZIKV  infection in RPE cells, and 2) ADAR1 overexpression reduced, while ADAR1 knockdown  increased, ZIKV replication in RPE cells. These findings led us to investigate the role of ADAR1  in retinal innate immunity to ZIKV and other flaviviruses. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is  to determine the mechanisms of antiviral actions of ADAR1 in attenuating ZIKV replication in RPE  cells (Aim 1); and to determine the consequences of ADAR1 ablation and ADAR1 overexpression  on ZIKV-induced chorioretinal atrophy in a mouse model (Aim 2). The proposed studies will  broaden and deepen our knowledge of the antiviral response during ocular ZIKV infection. Our  studies could also identify new targets and treatment modalities based on the RNA editing ability  of the host.",1,1d
C15227,"Shorter T-cell telomeres, lymphopenia, and high mortality of older people with COVID-19","SUMMARY  The familiar assertion that older persons are more likely to die from COVID-19 because of their declining  immunity is factual but also reductive. This project seeks to generate more specific insight into the high COVID-  19 mortality among older adults by focusing on the role of T-cell telomere length (TL) in the lymphopenia that  often develops in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The central hypothesis posits that COVID-19 patients with  short telomeres are more likely to develop severe T-cell lymphopenia, less likely to normalize their T- cell count  during the course of the disease, and therefore less likely to clear the virus and recover. It is directly relevant to  aging because TL shortens with age, and older age poses a heightened risk of severe disease after infection  with SARS-CoV-2. The work will also explore the potential role of T-cell TL in suppressing the innate immune  response, a major contributor to the ""cytokine storm"" that is largely mediated by pro-inflammatory monocytes.  The project will study 417 adults hospitalized with COVID-19, half of whom with a severe form of the disease  indicated by admission to the ICU. Blood samples will be collected on admission (time point T1), at day 3 (time  point T2) and at day 7 (time point T3). All-cause mortality will be determined up to 30 days after T1. As very  short telomeres, not mean telomere length, undermine cell viability, T-cell TL parameters will be quantified by  the novel Telomeres Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), a method that detects and measures short telomeres,  including those below the range detectable by standard methods. Aim 1 will examine the relation of T-cell TL  parameters at T1 with mortality. It will test the hypothesis that short T-cell TL at T1 predicts mortality, and that  T-cell lymphopenia at T2 is a mediator of this relationship. Aim 2 will probe deeper into the relation between T-  cell TL parameters at T1 and mortality, testing the hypothesis that older age drives the pathway examined in Aim  1. The findings of these two aims will generate new knowledge about the relation between aging, T-cell TL  parameters and T-cell lymphopenia, and test models that postulate causal effects of these factors on all-cause  mortality in COVID-19. Aim 3, an exploratory aim, will examine the relation of T-cell TL parameters with selected  cytokine levels and monocyte subsets in blood samples donated by 50 participants in Aims 1 and 2. This aim  represents the first step of examining the role of T- cell TL in the innate immune response to infection by SARS-  CoV-2. Findings of the study have the potential to transform understanding of the causes of COVID-19  lymphopenia, elucidate the mechanism underlying the relationship between older age and COVID-19 mortality,  and motivate development of new treatments. They may also be relevant to understanding adaptive responses  of older adults to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, insight generated by this project will be important  for not only the present pandemic but also outbreaks and pandemics by other β-coronaviruses that will almost  certainly happen in the future.","1, 4","1d, 4a, 4b"
P22902,Immune mechanisms of influenzaÃƒÂƒÃ'Â¢ÃƒÂ'Ã'Â€ÃƒÂ'Ã'Âinduced exacerbation of atherosclerosis,"Immune mechanisms of Influenza-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis  Influenza A infection is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is estimated that 3-4 million  cases of severe illness and 300,000 deaths due to influenza infection occur annually. During influenza  pandemics, the focus is on lung disease, which is the most common cause of death. However, recent  epidemiological studies reported significant mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) during  influenza infection. Atherosclerosis is a common cause of coronary artery disease (CAD), including MI, stroke,  and heart failure. The innate and adaptive immune response to modified lipids and vascular endothelial cells  causes a series of events that result in plaque formation in medium to large-sized arteries. If inflammatory stimuli  continue, plaques become vulnerable to rupture and can cause MI. However, the mechanism involved in the  influenza-induced increase in MI incidence is not clear.  Our long-term research goal is to understand the impact of lung-vascular interactions in atherosclerosis. The  objective of this application is to determine how influenza infection directly or indirectly impacts the outcome of  atherosclerosis. In Aim 1, we will characterize myeloid and lymphoid cellular subsets from lung, aorta, and spleen  at various time points (early, peak, recovery phase) after fluorescent-labeled (Color-flu) influenza infection to  track influenza virus along with the cellular recruitment to the vessel. We will then examine whether antigen  presentation is impacted by oxidized LDL (oxLDL) using bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) and T cell re-  stimulation in vitro. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of type III IFNs (IFNÃŽÂ>>) systemically (intraperitoneal) or  locally in the lung (oropharyngeal) in influenza-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Further, we will  determine the effect of IFNÃŽÂ>> on foam cell formation in macrophages. Finally, we will determine the effect of  conditioned media from influenza or type I (IFNÃŽÂ²), type II (IFNÃŽÂ³), and type III (IFNÃŽÂ>>)-treated human bronchial  epithelial cells (HBE) on human primary aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) to identify the mechanism involved in  the lung-vascular interactions in atherosclerosis. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of IL-17 neutralization  systemically (intraperitoneal) or locally in the lung (oropharyngeal) in influenza induced-exacerbation of  atherosclerosis. Further, we will determine the effect of lung epithelial IL-17RC signaling during influenza  infection in atherosclerotic Apoe-/- mice. Finally, we will determine the effect of conditioned media from influenza-  infected or IL-17-treated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) on vascular endothelial cells (HAEC) to identify  the mechanism involved in the lung-vascular interactions in atherosclerosis. At the completion of these studies,  we expect to have made mechanistic insights into the cellular trafficking, viral trafficking, systemic and local  effects of IFNs and IL-17, and pulmonary epithelial IL-17 signaling in influenza-induced exacerbation of  atherosclerosis that may help to identify immune-based therapeutic targets.",4,"4a, 4b"

P23627,The Effect of Resistance to Epidemic Measures on Disease Spread and Mortality 'Äì What'Äôs the Role of Online Misinformation?,"Aim: The REMEDY project will provide innovative interdisciplinary empirical research that explores the driver and health  consequences of resistant behaviour against epidemic measures, leveraging social science insights, economic and statistical methods  and data science techniques.  Background: In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, one pressing challenge for the public health response is the general resistance  to legitimate public health policies driven by news media, influencers, extremist politicians, and rampant misinformation circulated  on the internet 'Äì a potential information disorder due to an 'Äúinfodemic'Äù. There is, however, little understanding of the mechanism  through which these potentially malicious messages propagate and how they, in turn, influence the behaviour of the population in  opposing vaccine, mask-wearing, mobility restrictions, social distancing, and consequently leading to higher levels of morbidity and  mortality.  Methods: This project employs different quantitative and research methodologies to estimate the effects of behavioural resistance on  the epidemic spread and excess mortality and whether online misinformation explains this resistance behaviour. First, we link real-world data on vaccine refusal, fines for non-compliance and the frequency and scale of anti-mask/vax/digital COVID-19 certificate  protests to the local epidemic spread, hospitalisation and excess mortality rate over time. Second, after identifying the different types  of online misinformation on COVID-19 and vaccines, we use geo-tagged digital records on search engines and social media to analyse  the association between online sentiments towards public health measures and real-world resistance behaviour at a specific geographic unit.   Impact: The project will not only provide hard evidence on the linkage between resistance behaviour and population health  outcomes, but will also present the gravity of precariously allowing misinformation to flourish on the internet.",9,"9a, 9c, 9d"
C07221,A Nurse-Community Health Worker-Family Partnership Model to Increase COVID-19 Testing in Urban Underserved and Vulnerable Communities,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT New York City (NYC) is a global epicenter of the SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 pandemic, with 223,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths. Neighborhood-level disparities in cases and deaths in NYC can be explained by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic characteristics, where Latinx and Black New Yorkers and those living in highpoverty neighborhoods are 1.5 times more likely to test positive and more than twice as likely to die as a resultof COVID-19. The community of Mott Haven is located in the South Bronx - one of the poorest congressionaldistricts within the continental United States. Mott Haven is highly diverse (73% are Latinx and 24% are Black),and the COVID-19 mortality rate is higher than NYC as a whole - an epicenter within an epicenter. Yet, although Mott Haven is clearly a priority community for COVID-related prevention, detection, vaccination, and treatment initiatives, so far fewer than 2% of residents have been tested. COVID-19 secondary attack rates are highest in households, varying between 12 - 38%.     This led us to propose a COVID-19 testing and mitigation intervention in public housing households in Mott Haven, which are characterized by crowding, intergenerational co-residence, and a high proportion of low wage ""essential workers"" who leave the home for work even during lockdown periods. We will evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative Nurse-Community Health Worker (CHW)-Family Partnership intervention designed to promote COVID-19 testing uptake, adoption of COVID-19 control measures, and mutual aid capacity at the household level. Our intervention is adapted from the Nurse-Family Partnership model, which has been shown to be effective and cost-effective in improving maternal and child health outcomes in high-poverty, racially- and ethnically-diverse communities. CHWs will provide culturally-appropriate support to families, addressing stigma, medical mistrust, and other common barriers to engagement in healthcare.     We propose a 2-arm randomized controlled trial, in which 270 households (810 individuals) will be randomly assigned (2:1) to either the experimental group of families who will receive the Nurse-CHW-Family Partnership intervention and the offer of in-home testing and influenza vaccination, or the treatment-as-usual control group referred to free testing and flu vaccination located within walking distance. Participants in both arms will be assessed at baseline and monthly for 12 months.     Findings from this study will provide an evidence-base to inform current and future public health initiatives related to COVID-19 mitigation in other high-risk settings.

C19870,Understanding and Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic Effect on the Magnitude of Alcohol-Related Liver Disease in Alberta.,"Approximately 1 in 4 Canadians is practicing high-risk alcohol drinking (more than 10 drinks a week for women and 15 drinks a week for men) based on the Canadian guidelines. There has been a striking increase of alcohol sales and consumption in relation to the pandemic. One in 3 adult people who practice high-risk alcohol consumption (also known as heavy alcohol drinking) has alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) which accounts for nearly 50% of deaths related to end-stage liver disease. ArLD patients experience worse clinical outcomes compared to other patients with chronic liver disease.  The severity of ArLD depends on alcohol consumption and stage of liver scarring, known as fibrosis. Currently, there are no clinical care pathways designed for early detection of individuals with ArLD and risk stratification before they are diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. With the recent increase in alcohol sales, hospitalizations, and mortality related to ArLD in Canada, there is an urgent need to establish a clinical care pathway to identify and risk stratify patients with ArLD.  In our proposed project, we aim to evaluate the burden of ArLD in Alberta in relation to the pandemic. Our goal is to develop and evaluate the first clinical care pathway to identify and risk stratify patients with ArLD in primary care in the Calgary Health Zone using simple non-invasive serum markers. We will connect patients at risk of advanced liver scarring due to ArLD with multi-disciplinary teams to provide medical and social care. We will also evaluate the performance of our clinical pathway and compare two common modalities to risk stratify liver fibrosis among patients with ArLD (serum-based and ultrasound-based).  This project is novel, timely, and essential to meet the urgent and unmet need of identifying and supporting the increasing number of ArLD patients in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.",10,10a
C19692,Identifying and responding to children and youth mental health need during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Examination of individual and agency level factors impacting outcomes in Ontario,"Although children and youth are less likely to be hospitalized by COVID-19, they remain vulnerable to the psychological impacts of the pandemic. Abrupt changes to daily routines of children, various pandemic-related parental stressors, social isolation from friends and extended family members and lack of access to social and structural supports during this time might leave children vulnerable to psychopathology, and parents with fewer resources to meet their children's needs. Yet, an alarming number of these children and youth did not have their needs adequately met prior to the pandemic. The current study utilizes interRAI data from over 50 participating agencies across Ontario, including over 36,000 child and youth assessments. Researchers will examine the trends and characteristics of children and youth prior to and during the multiple waves of the pandemic, as well as study the impact of services and associated risk factors (e.g., staff shortages, program closures) on changes in mental health and child/youth-level outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic data. Moreover, child and agency level data will be examined to evaluate mental health outcomes based on sex, gender, and area-based social-economic status, to indicate populations with the greatest mental health decline (i.e. depression, anxiety, behaviour, self-harm) and poorest quality of life indicators (e.g., health, education, relationships). Family and social supports will be evaluated alongside these risks, by determining protective effects such as caregiver involvement, financial assistance, and interpersonal resources. Researchers will engage in knowledge exchange with health system partners, policy makers and national researchers to create a network to share findings that are broadly accessible to health system administrators across the country.",10,"10a, 10b"

C15115,Structure and Dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein,"Summary  The COVID19 pandemic may take 1-3 years and only fully subside once we reach herd immunity. Given  the high mortality of COVID19, it is of critical importance to reach herd immunity through a vaccine. The  viral spike glycoprotein (S) is central to our efforts for developing an effective vaccine immunogen. The S  protein mediates viral entry into susceptible cells, is the primary target for antibodies, and is a widely  used antigen in diagnostic kits. As such understanding the structure and dynamics of the S protein, and  how antibodies engage it, is important to our response to COVID19. S consists of a trimer of S1/S2  dimers. S1 contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with receptor ACE2. S2 is further  processed by proteases into S2' that mediates fusion. Structural insights into the S protein have been  gained by single particle cryo electron microscopy (SP cryoEM) of a soluble trimer comprising most of the  ectodomain, as well as by cryo electron tomography (cryoET) and SP cryoEM of native virus particles.  These structural studies have revealed several distinct conformational prefusion states wherein the RBD  domain points either up or down. Receptor ACE2 binds the RBD in the up conformation and stabilizes S  in the `two-RBD-up' or `three-RBD-up' conformations. The observations of several distinct conformations  at the EM level suggest that the S trimer exists in a conformational equilibrium. Real-time measurements  of conformational dynamics of the S protein have not been performed. Many antibodies that bind and  neutralize the S protein are being isolated from single B cells from recovered patients, or generated in  mice, and their epitopes are being structurally characterized. Surprisingly, even though many antibodies  clearly bind SARS-CoV-2 S, many do not neutralize the virus. Vaccine studies and clinical trials based on  soluble RBD and S immunogens are under way. In general, they elicit antibodies and can protect from  challenge in non-human primates and underscore our hope that a vaccine that develops antibodies  against the S protein will be successful. However, the observation of non-neutralizing antibodies, a  decline of antibodies in patients and worrisome evidence that antibody-bound coronavirus particles are  responsible for the tissue-damaging inflammatory response seen in patients indicate that we need to  know more about antibody mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To address these challenges, the  Mothes, Liu, Xiong and Blanchard laboratories will employ single molecule and in vivo imaging  techniques to determine the structure and dynamics of ligand-free and antibody-bound SARS-CoV-2 S  protein in the context of virus particles, and determine the fate of antibody-bound virus in vivo. Our work  will inform active and passive immunization strategies against the COVID19 pandemic.",1,1b
P21939,ARBOVIRUS CIRCULATION AND DIVERSITY OF MOSQUITO VECTORS ACROSS HABITATS IN THE GAMBIA,"Project Summary/Abstract   This application seeks to examine arbovirus and mosquito vector prevalence and identify their possible  influence in The Gambia. An existing infrastructure in the country for malaria investigation will jumpstart this  project. Like malaria, mosquito-borne arboviruses can cause febrile illness; with significant morbidity and even  mortality, in multiple regions of the world. Practically nothing is known about the arboviruses that circulate in The  Gambia; except for three instances: an outbreak of Yellow Fever over forty years ago, localized antibody  evidence of Zika virus, and two one-off cases of Rift Valley fever. Arboviral activity of this unique country is poorly  understood. Importantly, there are cases of acute febrile illness in The Gambia that are not attributable to malaria,  and we hypothesize that arboviruses are circulating in the region that could be responsible for a proportion of  such cases. In addition, there is a paucity of data on local mosquito populations, other than the Anopheline  vectors of malaria, and potential vectors of arboviruses. Incrimination of mosquito species responsible for natural  arbovirus transmission is pivotal to understanding pathogen dynamics and designing precise vector control  strategies.   To enhance response to emerging public health threats in The Gambia, the proposed research aims to  address gaps in the knowledge of mosquito-borne arboviruses and their vectors by: (a) sampling mosquitoes in  The Gambia (utilizing a framework already in place for malaria monitoring, with extended sampling locations) to  contrast vector species communities in different landscapes during both the dry and rainy seasons, and to  assess arboviral evidence to determine mosquito infection rates across regions; and (b) evaluating vector  species diversity and abundance, as well as predictors of the risk of detected mosquito species and arboviruses,  considering their prevalence in association with seasonality, macroclimate, and landscape development. Vector  and arbovirus presence can, in future, be compared to potential geographic prevalence of human cases.   When fever is not caused by malaria, local epidemiology, including a baseline knowledge of what arboviruses  and their vectors are circulating in a region, can guide medical decisions. The proposed research is both  significant and novel because it addresses the lack of understanding of arbovirus existence in a previously  unstudied country, one that is experiencing unexplained cases of acute febrile illness. Although neighboring  Senegal has been noted for an arboviral presence, The Gambia has a separate geography, public health system,  and political setting, and is unexplored in this respect. Non-malarial febrile illness occurs in The Gambia, and  we propose initial steps for investigating arboviruses as potential etiological agents, allowing for improved  understanding of infectious disease agents. We aim to generate preliminary data for studies of arboviruses  threatening health in The Gambia and, ultimately, facilitating targeted prevention of arboviral pathogens (as well  as malaria) and a more streamlined approach to addressing vector-borne disease burden.","2, 3","2b, 3a"

C17942,Using data to improve public health: COVID-19 secondment,"This project will be delivered with colleagues from the Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing National Core Study (LHW NCS) and will focus on investigating the effect of COVID-19 on cancer and mental health of the population. It will use routine health data (electronic health records) from primary and secondary care. More specifically, the project will use platforms such as the NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment and OpenSAFELY, which link anonymised patient health records across different healthcare sectors, and make the data available for research in a way that is secure and transparent. The lead researcher on this project, Dr Lemanska from the University of Surrey, has already undertaken and published a study on the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on mental health. This research showed a dramatic drop in GP consultations for mental health during 2020, while the prescriptions system was more resilient and was not disrupted. The study discussed implications and recommendations for future pandemics in relation to switching to remote consultations and preventing backlogs in the NHS. This work led to a joint project with Public Health England (PHE) that compared the COVID-19-related disruption across healthcare systems including primary, out of hours and emergency care.  The current research will contribute to the emerging picture regarding the wider healthcare implications of the COVID-19 crisis and in turn contribute to the national efforts in the fight against the pandemic. COVID-19 and lockdowns led to a shift in healthcare needs of patients. The pandemic has also affected the availability and readiness of NHS services to deliver healthcare and highlighted how difficult it can be to deliver healthcare under such challenging conditions. This project will build on Dr Lemanska's COVID-19 health disruption work. It will use linked electronic health records from different healthcare settings in the UK to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns on the delivery and outcomes of cancer care. Specifically, we will investigate how cancer screening and diagnostic testing was affected. For example, we plan to investigate prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen blood tests which are used in primary and secondary care to detect cancer. In the area of mental health, we are interested in investigating the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. For example, we will look at how many people developed new mental health symptoms, new diagnoses, or needed new prescriptions for common mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse, self-harm, sleep and eating disorders.","10, 11","10a, 11a"

The proposed administrative supplement to BRAIN-ICU-2 Study (R01 AG58639) is in response toNIA Availability of Administrative Supplements and Revision Supplements on Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) (NOT-AG-022; PA-18-591). To understand the brain tissue damage of acute delirium caused bySevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we will perform new neuropathologicalstudies of critically ill patients affected by COVID-19, as well as those with Alzheimer's disease and relateddementia (ADRD) with/without critical illness. By studying COVID-19, we will better understand the relationshipbetween delirium and ADRD. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, intensive care units (ICU's) across thenation are awash with patients experiencing delirium, a major ICU risk factor for future ADRD. These deliriumsymptoms of impaired consciousness include headache, alteration of gustatory, olfactory, and visual function,neuropathy, seizures, agitation, encephalitis, and/or Guillain-Barre syndrome. These delirium signs andsymptoms could be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain, particularly in those with ADRD. We do notknow if there are direct nervous system consequences of COVID-19 (e.g., inflammation), and/or indirectnervous system consequences, e.g., coagulopathy. To our knowledge, limited autopsy series that includedbrain tissue have been published. No information about ADRD was provided. The proposed supplement willspecifically compare multiple groups of patients, ICU patients with/without ADRD with/without COVID-19, alongwith non-ICU patients with/without ADRD and with/without COVID-19.

C03915,Inflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis in Coronavirus infection,"SUMMARYHuman Coronaviruses (hCoV) cause severe respiratory syndromes like SARS, MERS, and the ongoingpandemic of Covid-19 caused by the recently identified SARS-Cov2. Human and murine studies indicate thatexcessive inflammation, rather than viral replication, may precipitate these infections into lethal diseases. Theoverarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the excessive inflammation and neutrophil recruitmenttriggered by IL-1β and pyroptotic cell lysis severely impair the host ability to control infection and maintainhomeostasis. The corollary of this hypothesis, if proven correct, is that carefully timed inhibition of IL-1β,pyroptosis, and neutrophil proteases should be beneficial to treat Covid-19 and other hCoV infections.Increasing the significance of our study, these therapies are already approved to treat a number of humandiseases, a fact that bodes well for a rapid approval to treat Covid-19 and other hCoV infections. The mouseCoV MHV-1 provides an excellent model of CoV lung infections and will be used to test our hypothesis inthese specific aims: AIM 1. Is IL-1β deleterious during CoV infection and through which mechanisms? We willtest the hypothesis that excessive production of IL-1β drives neutrophil recruitment to the infected lung withconsequent tissue damage. The ability of IL-1β to exacerbate the pathogenesis of MHV-1 lung infection willbe studied in susceptible and resistant mouse strains treated with pharmacological inhibitors of IL-1β or instrains deficient in IL-1β. We will determine whether excessive neutrophil recruitment damages lung tissuethrough release of neutrophil elastase. We will also test the hypothesis that IL-1β inhibits type I and type IIIIFN production by stimulation of PGE2 synthesis. We will use genetic and pharmacological approaches toexamine how inhibition of PGE2 production affects IFN-I and IFN-III production during MHV-1 infection. Wewill test whether interventions to regulate IFN-I or PGE2 in the early or late phases of the infection haveopposite effect on the disease outcome. AIM 2. Is pyroptosis beneficial or deleterious in MHV-1 infection andwhich inflammasome triggers cell death? We will test the hypothesis that gasdermin D-dependent pyroptosisof lung cells may affect pathogenesis of coronavirus infection in opposite ways by either restricting viralreplication or exacerbating inflammation. We will test the hypothesis that pyroptosis of CoV-infected lungepithelial or endothelial cells is mediated by caspase-11. Mouse strains that lack expression of caspase-11 inlung epithelial or endothelial cells have been generated in our lab and will be used to test tissue-specific roleof caspase-11 during MHV-1 infection.",1,"1b, 1d"
C07164,Effectiveness of an Integrated Treatment to Address Smoking Cessation and Anxiety/Depression in People Living with HIV,"Early data indicate that smoking increases the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms.Individuals living with HIV are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than those in the general population,placing them at high risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes. Comorbidities associated with HIV, includingcardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease, further heighten risk for a severe course of COVID-19 illness,which has been linked to over 40,000 deaths in the U.S. thus far. To mitigate COVID-19 related healthdisparities and inform intervention strategies, it is crucial to assess the degree to which nicotine dependenceand HIV disease stage affect the onset and progression of COVID-19 in smokers living with HIV. Disruptions to engagement in HIV care and antiretroviral therapy regimens may compromise efforts tomaintain viral suppression and lead to increases in rates of anxiety and depression, both of which are alreadyelevated in individuals living with HIV compared to the general population. Increases in negative affect (anxietyand depression) are established pathways to smoking relapse among smokers living with HIV who may usecigarettes to regulate their negative mood; therefore, increases in anxiety and depression resulting from theCOVID-19 pandemic could impact smoking cessation and relapse. Given the primary outcomes of the parentgrant, we will also examine the ways in which COVID-19 related mental health responses COVID-19influenceuptake of smoking cessation treatments, smoking abstinence, and other relevant smoking outcomes. This proposed Administrative Supplement is responsive to the Notice of Special Interest regarding theAvailability of Administrative Supplements Research on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (NOSI - NOT-DA-20-047)issued by NIDA and is appropriate to PA-18-591 (Administrative Supplements to Existing NIH Grants).Specifically, our application is responsive to 3 areas of research requested by the NOSI: (1) ""Research todetermine whether substance use (especially smoking tobacco...) is a risk factor for the onset and progressionof COVID-19,"" (2) ""Research on how HIV among persons who use substances may impact the onset andprogression of COVID-19,"" and (3) ""Research using ongoing studies to understand the broad impacts ofCOVID-19 (e.g., anxiety...) on ..., substance use, substance use disorders, and access to addiction treatment.""

P22325,Role of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in glaucoma pathobiology,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of Zika virus (ZIKV) in glaucoma pathobiology. ZIKV is  an emerging viral pathogen that causes microcephaly and leads to severe ocular complications in newborns  born to ZIKV infected mothers. Although the ocular manifestations of ZIKV are primarily reported to affect the  posterior segment of the eye resulting in chorioretinal atrophy, withering of the retina and choroid, and optic  nerve abnormalities, several clinical case reports showed the involvement of the anterior segment resulting in  glaucoma. Studies from our laboratory, as well as those of others, have shown that ZIKV can cause  glaucomatous pathology including an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss,  and optic nerve damage. The offspring of ZIKV infected dams have shown increased IOP and RGC loss and  the presence of anti-flavivirus-antibody in these mice correlates with significantly enhanced glaucoma  pathology due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Until the recent ZIKV epidemics, glaucoma has been  primarily considered as a genetic and age-related disease and has not been reported among infants exposed  to infection during gestation. Several studies have now reported that ZIKV can cause congenital glaucoma in  infants born from mothers who were infected during pregnancy. Considering the fact that there is an endemic  transmission of ZIKV in >84 countries, it is imperative to investigate the link between ZIKV and glaucoma to  develop new prognostic and therapeutic tools to combat this global health threat. Our laboratory has developed  several in vitro and in vivo models to study the pathobiology of ocular ZIKV infections. In our recent study, we  reported that ZIKV can infect and replicate in human primary Trabecular Meshwork cells (HTMC). More  recently, we performed RNAseq analysis and discovered that ZIKV infection of HTMC leads to transcriptomic  alteration and dysregulation of several pathways including those that modulate ER stress response,  autophagy, hypoxia, and ECM organization. Furthermore, ZIKV-infected mice exhibited increased IOP, ER  stress, and autophagy in the anterior segment of the eye. ZIKV infection also caused RGC death and loss of  RGC and optic nerve damage leading to disruption of anterograde axonal transport. Based on these novel  findings, we hypothesize that ZIKV induces ER stress and autophagy resulting in TM death and dysfunction,  increased IOP, and the development of glaucoma. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim  1 will determine the role of ZIKV induced ER stress in TM dysfunction and the pathobiology of glaucoma using  C57BL/6 (WT) and IFNAR1-/- mice/pups and whether the reduction of ER stress alleviates ZIKV induced  glaucomatous pathology. Aim 2 will investigate the role of autophagy using HTMC, and mouse models and  evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an FDA approved drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in ZIKV induced  glaucoma. The anticipated results will establish the role of ZIKV infection in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and  elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathway-mediated therapeutic targets for future treatments.","4, 6","4b, 6g"

C09984,Road to recovery:Understanding the impact of COVID and recovery phases on children  and young people with Intellectual Disabilities and their families,"Intellectual disabilities (ID) are characterised by social, cognitive, and adaptive skill deficits (Zayac & Johnston, 2008), which are associated with challenging behaviours (Lee, et al., 2008), and communication difficulties (Memisevic & Hadzic, 2013). Elevated levels of mental health issues have been reported in young people with ID (Young‐Southward, et al., 2017) and their parents (Eisenhower et al., 2005). The COVID-19 response strategy entailed limiting access to education, respite care, and specialist services, reduced the available support for families, with unknown consequences. The relative vulnerability of children with ID was highlighted by a recent report by the Children's Society (2020) which indicated that children with ID are more susceptible to wellbeing and mental health issues as a result of COVID and require urgent support in adapting to routine changes and understanding what is going on. These routine changes and reduction in access to services will continue for some time despite the recent implementation of the UK wide vaccination programme, further compounding mental health outcomes in children with ID and their parents. As we move into COVID transition phase, the current project will: 1) identify the family structure and social demographics of families who have a child with ID who are at greater risk of parent and child negative mental health outcomes; 2) explore the lived experiences of CYP with ID and their caregivers during COVID and transition phases 3) understand the CYP's and parent's experience of the recovery phase, including the lasting effects of COVID.",10,10a
P25288,The immunologic and virologic determinants of long COVID,"Coronavirus infection has been confirmed in over 157 million people worldwide and over 4 million people in the UK. Initially, there was understandable focus on the care of patients hospitalized with severe disease, but it has subsequently been recognized that many individuals managed their symptoms in the community during the acute phase of COVID-19. The long-term effects of infection in both groups are now becoming apparent. Long COVID describes a broad range of symptoms that persist 12 weeks after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms are diverse and commonly include fatigue, breathlessness, cognitive impairment (""brain fog""), chest pain, palpitations, and persistent disturbances in smell and taste. Data from the Office for National Statistics suggest that over a million people in the suffer with long COVID in the UK. The potential economic impact and anticipated burden faced by the NHS as a consequence of long COVID has been acknowledged more recently, and a spotlight has been focused on the need for research into the multisystem effects of the condition to inform the future development of diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. Published studies have emphasized the importance of immune responses during acute COVID19. However, little is known about the role of the immune system in long COVID.

The hub has a track-record of reporting results that have been widely welcomed and valued by the UK civil service and reported widely to public audiences in the media. As the pandemic continues, understanding the use of testing systems remains vital to optimise the Covid-19 response and save lives. With innovation and learning continuing (e.g. around the UK government's ambitious mass-testing programme), we propose to undertake further comparative research to share lessons across contexts.  In order to support Covid-19 responses internationally, we will engage with governments and share deliverables from the early months of this 15-month project. Additionally, to inform preparations for future outbreaks and pandemics, we will contribute to national and international fora seeking to learn lessons from the current crisis.",9,9e
C10519,FORECAST VARIABLES. RESOURCES CONSUMED AND HOSPITAL COST OF PATIENTS ADMITTED FOR SARS-COV-2 INFECTION ACCORDING TO THEIR FRAGILITY,"At the present time, COVID-19 has generated the greatest public health crisis, putting the health care system at serious risk of collapse. Thus, in mid-March it was necessary to resort to the national state of emergency and impose a home confinement that will continue at least until mid-April, with great chances of an extension. During this time, all the services of our hospitals, and especially the emergency and intensive care services, leave completely healthy, exceeding 100% of the existing capacity. In this authentic chaos, tents and pavilions are being set up to be able to attend the increasing number of patients with mild, moderate or severe symptoms of the disease. In addition, the prognostic, as well as the clinical presentation, is highly variable, with no empirical evidence to corroborate these differences. In this project we want to stratify the infected population according to different stages of frailty, in order to study the difference in evolution as well as in the use of hospital resources.","4, 11","4b, 4c, 11b"
P23419,Characterizing transmission dynamics and evaluating medical countermeasures to inform the clinical and public health response to monkeypox,"Outbreaks of monkeypox in Nigeria since 2017 and the 2022 global emergence of monkeypox in previously non-endemic regions, such as Canada, point to a need to characterize and compare the transmission dynamics in endemic and non-endemic regions. A critical aspect of the global outbreak has been transmissions in the context of sexual networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM).      This project aims to characterize and compare monkeypox transmission dynamics across two diverse epidemic contexts; evaluate the role of antivirals in the treatment of human monkeypox (clinical trial); and evaluate the role of vaccination in the prevention of human monkeypox (real-world effectiveness). IDRC funds will only go to the African co-lead in Nigeria. Research methodology for the Nigeria work will include a mix of a prospective cohort study of suspected Monkeypox cases in two cities in Nigeria; surveillance study of subclinical infection among GBM; and formative research on trial readiness and vaccine acceptability in Nigeria. Comparative research in Canada (and internationally) will be funded through CIHR funds.      A global research consortium will be carrying out this research and the Nigerian principal applicant is the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. Results include rapid evidence on the transmission dynamics of monkeypox in the endemic and non-endemic regions to guide urgent policy decisions, clinical and public health program implementation surrounding medical and other countermeasures. The collective research infrastructure and multidirectional capacity building will provide a foundation to further expand and pivot to emergent monkeypox research questions as the epidemic re-shapes and unfolds over the next two years in Canada, Nigeria, and globally across diverse epidemic contexts.","3, 6, 9, ","3a, 6l, 9d, 9e"
C09668,Incentivising pharmaceutical companies to improve equitable access to healthcare interventions,"Equitable access is critical for maximising the impact of innovation and heavily depends on proactive actions by pharmaceutical companies, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to bring the pandemic to an end, achieve universal health coverage and protect the gains made on Sustainable Development Goal 3, the pharmaceutical industry will need to ensure that all scientific advancements benefit the maximum number of people, independent of the place they live or their ability to pay. The Access to Medicine Foundation (ATMF) has incentivised pharmaceutical company action to improve access to new innovations for more than a decade. By rewarding positive action, sharing best practices, and highlighting opportunities for change, the ATMF encourages companies to become willing partners to improve global access to their products. The ATMF will support Wellcome Trust's approach to equitable access to healthcare interventions through a combination of research and policy initiatives that will (a) incentivise pharmaceutical company action on COVID-19, (b) support global efforts to mainstream access principles during product development and (c) untap the potential of generic medicine manufacturers in expanding access to innovations in low- and middle-income countries.

P22334,ZIP 2.0 STUDY CHILD COHORT WITH INTERIM ANALYSIS OF AGE 30 MONTHS DATA,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus (vector-borne virus) of the genus Flaviviridae. Infections  were thought to be mild and self-limiting until 2015, when an epidemic was observed initially  in Brazil of microcephaly and other birth defects in newborns following infection of the  mother during pregnancy with Zika virus (ZIKV). Increasing evidence now points to ZIKV as  the agent responsible for a variety of birth defects in newborns of mothers who become  infected during pregnancy. The relationship of ZIKV infections in pregnant women with  adverse outcomes of pregnancy is the subject of ongoing evaluation. Studies to date of infants  born to infected women focus on those born with serious birth defects that constitute the  congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Whether there are latent effects on growth and development  in infants who are born without CZS to Zika-infected women, and what those effects may be,  is unclear. Longitudinal studies of infants born to Zika-infected pregnant women are needed  to assess the broader spectrum and natural history of possible manifestations of intrauterine or  intrapartum Zika exposure.  In 2016, NIH initiated a large, multicenter, international observational study of the  epidemiology, natural history, and pathogenesis of Zika in infants and pregnancy (the ZIP  Study). The ZIP Study followed infants born to women at risk for Zika infection during  pregnancy only through the infantsÃ¢Â€Â™ first 12 months of life and completed its last patient last  visit December 2019. In 2018, NIH initiated the ZIP 2.0 cohort study of Zika exposed  children and unexposed control children from the ZIP Study or similar studies, following  children beyond infancy to 42 months of age to evaluate the effects of Zika on child growth  and development.  Recent studies have found that infants who had in utero ZIKV exposure without CZS appear  to be at risk for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first 18 months of life1 and  similarly observed high frequencies of anatomical and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in  children without microcephaly who were exposed to ZIKV in utero2. One study found a  gradient of risk of development delay according to head circumference, with severely  microcephalic children at highest risk for delays while normocephalic ZIKV-exposed children  showed similar risk to unexposed control children3. However, several other studies have  observed abnormal neurodevelopment in the absence of microcephaly among children with  intrauterine ZIKV exposure4,5. Those reports indicate that nearly all such children presented at  least one developmental delay and that a significant proportion of children exposed in utero to  ZIKV developed mild cognitive delay and auditory behavioral abnormalities.","3, 4","3d, 4b"

C19800,Safety and Efficacy of Preventative COVID Vaccines- STOPCoV ( Phase 2),"There has been rapid approval of the COVID-19 vaccines. The participants in the initial research were mostly Caucasian with an average age of 50 years and with little underlying illness. More information is needed as to how well the vaccines work and are tolerated in older persons and in a more diverse population like Ontario. STOPCov has enrolled 911 persons over 70 years of age and is comparing them to 380 persons 30-50 years who received COVID vaccine. Participants completed an e-consent and were assigned a unique participant number to maintain confidentiality. They were emailed study documents and completed on-line questionnaires about their demographics, underlying illness and prescription medications and any prior COVID-19 diagnosis.  They completed a 7 day on-line diary about any local (pain, swelling, redness) or systemic reactions (fever, chills, muscle aches) after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. More information is also needed on how well older individuals respond to the vaccine. In STOPCoV this is being determined by measuring the levels of antibodies or proteins produced in response to the vaccine. To do this part of the study, consenting participants collect their own blood spots from finger pricks with a lancet, apply the blood spots to a filter paper and mail them to the research center for analysis. Written and video instructions on how to do this were provided.  It is becoming clear, that older ( and later younger) individuals will be offered a ""booster"" or third dose of vaccine. Hence this new phase of the study is proposed to determine the antibody response to a third vaccine dose, to follow the antibody levels for an additional year and to complete and additional 7-day diary about any side effects to the third dose. We will also study the impact of race, gender, and underlying illness (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart, liver or kidney disease) on vaccine safety and effectiveness. Our results will be shared with public health officials.","1, 7","1d, 7d"

C10659,Advancing Digital Connectivity to Support Population Mental Health during COVID-19,"COVID-19 has created multiple mental health stressors as identified by the World Health Organization. Canadians are being overwhelmed with rapid changes and uncertainty contributing to the mental health burden of pandemic life. This study will build on a previous knowledge synthesis project exploring existing and emerging digital mental health interventions to support better access to these resources during COVID-19. The use of a lower-tech two-way SMS texting program will provide opportunity for real-time community engagement (polling), to assess mental health needs and barriers to digital intervention access. The RE-AIM framework, a well-established implementation tool for planning and evaluating public health initiatives, will be used to monitor the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the program through three phases in a mixed methods design. The following research objectives will guide these efforts: 1) Implement a mental health COVID-19 SMS in collaboration with a patient/community advisory group to enhance the reach of the initiative; 2) Advance the effectiveness of the texting service through iterative cycles of reflection and action driven by advisory and SMS participant input; and, 3) Evaluate the adoption of the COVID-19 SMS program with a focus on acceptability, satisfaction, and clinical benefit. The use of texting extends the reach of this digital intervention across divides that may separate some vulnerable or disadvantaged groups from other forms of mental health access and the flexibility of the implementation approach allows for rapid adaptability as the pandemic unfolds.",10,10a
C15175,Develop novel inhaled neutralizing RNA therapeutics against COVID-19,"Project Abstract  Despite various antiviral agents or symptom-alleviating interventions under development, unfortunately no  effective drug treatment for COVID-19 have been readily identified so far. Given the desperate need for and  willingness to try new therapeutic approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, RNA-based therapeutics could  prove to be an attractive option due to their rational design and relatively faster speed of development compared  to conventional strategies. Utilizing our extensive experience and expertise in nucleic acid aptamer technology,  we will seek to design and develop RNA aptamer-based drug candidates that can provide immediate neutralizing  protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2  (ACE2) through its trimeric spike protein (S protein) on the virion, where after fusion of the viral membrane and  host cell membrane occurs. Subsequently, the RNA virus will replicate its genome inside the cells and ultimately  make new virions that will be secreted to infect other host cells. The S protein is the key target for the  development of neutralizing antibodies (Abs), vaccine and therapeutics. The immediate objective of our project  is to develop novel inhaled RNA aptamers that specifically bind to the conserved and functional essential  elements of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as viral neutralizing agents, to prevent viral entry and infection. Our central  hypothesis is that the inhaled neutralizing RNA intervention will have utility for both pre-exposure prophylaxis  and immediate post-exposure treatment to provide a 1st line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 and/or future  SARS-CoV stains. In addition to their utility as stand-alone antagonists, the aptamer can also be formulated as  cocktailed format or multivalent modality to maximize neutralization potency and breadth. The inhalation  administration will further maximize delivery to the epithelial cilial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract,  the tissue sites of initial viral attachment and infection. To the end, we expect successful completion to lead to a  translational stage and justify the use of inhaled neutralizing RNA therapeutics immediately in the clinic to protect  1st line health care workers and others at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The proposed research is both  significant and innovative, and could change current paradigms in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The  knowledge gained from this study can be rapidly deployed for combating a future strain evolution of SARS that  may emerge as a human healthcare threat.",6,"6a, 6g"
C19882,Understanding the Impact of The COVID-19 Pandemic on Academic Achievement in Ontario- A Population-Based Cohort Study,"Education is one of the most important modifiable social determinants of health. Improving academic achievement has been associated with better overall long-term educational attainment. Greater educational attainment associates with better health (greater control of chronic illness, less obesity and improved diet), and longevity. The COVID-19 pandemic and school closures have disrupted primary and secondary education for Ontario students. The impact of the pandemic may have been worse among students facing sociodemographic barriers and educational needs. The objectives of this study are: 1) To provide novel information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement among Ontario secondary students, and 2) To disseminate a novel, interactive, electronic platform for knowledge users (the Province of Ontario's Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO),educators, school board members), to share information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement. The platform will also be available to the general public. An integrated knowledge mobilization approach (iKMb) using population level data, in partnership with EQAO, will be conducted to achieve our research aims. As part of this approach, knowledge users will inform the project from start to finish. iKMb is the ideal approach in understanding and addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement; it gives the broader educational community the evidence to support the implementation of educational recommendations designed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ontario students. Since education is among the most important modifiable determinants of health, understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement is an important step in mitigating the impacts of the pandemic on children's future health.",10,10b
C20318,Identifying COVID-related mental health problems and resiliency in  youth to inform intervention policy from pre-pandemic levels of maternal environmental adversity and mood: The Maternal Adversity Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment Study,"Research demonstrates that environmental adversity (stressful life events, poor housing, financial problems, domestic violence, substance abuse, single parents) and poor maternal mood are associated with increased levels of mental health problems in both mothers and their children. However, not all mothers and children exposed to these risk factors exhibit poor mental health. Research also suggests that major environmental crises (e.g., COVID or large-scale disasters) differentially impact individuals based on pre-crisis factors such as socio-economic disadvantage, family discord, and mental health status. The objective of the present study is to identify resilient and at-risk families (mothers and/or children), using measures of maternal environmental adversity and mood, so that intervention policies that target appropriate families and/or individuals during times of large-scale crises can be established. This objective will be meet using the Maternal Adversity Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment Study: a genetic and sex informative longitudinal cohort with maternal and child data, including repeated socio-environmental and mental health measures, available from pregnancy to late adolescence. The proposed study will collect new COVID-related maternal and child (e.g., resiliency/flourishing, psychopathology, SES, social support, family functioning, and COVID-specific hardship and distress) data. Statistical analyses will assess whether current mental health functioning can be identified based on pre-pandemic factors, particularly environmental adversity and perinatal mood. In conjunction with our Knowledge Users committee, these findings will be used to develop policy for the rapid identification of families at-risk for mental health problems following a major environmental crisis and the establishment of effective interventions based on type of metal health problem, individual (mother and/or child), and family resources.",10,"10a, 10b"
C15223,Mechanism of the short- and long-term effects of COVID-19-induced Alarmins on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.,"ABSTRACT  The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the long-term sequalae of acute COVID-19 infection on  hematopoietic and immune damages, and to identify the key pathways and mechanism by which COVID-19-  associated cytokine dysregulation alters HSC function and differentiation. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes local  and systemic damages due to dysregulated immune response and cytokine production. Its long-term negative  effects on body tissue and organ remain largely unknown. Our published work showed that SARS-CoV-2  infection dramatically increased neutrophil production and neutrophil-associated S100A8/A9 (Alarmin) release.  Persistent high level of S100A8/A9 is a negative prognostic biomarker for the disease severity and mortality.  Although the function of S100A8/A9 on mature blood cells have been studied, its functional effect on  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are unknown. Our preliminary data show that S100A8/A9 causes loss of  quiescence and differentiation of HSC toward myeloid progenitors at the expense of HSCs. Toll-like receptor 4  (TLR4), the endogenous receptor of S100A8/A9, is highly expressed in HSCs, and S100A8/A9 activates its  canonical downstream MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Very interestingly, S100A8/A9 causes  downregulation of epigenetic regulator Setd2, leading to the c-Myc upregulation in HSCs. c-Myc is a key  downstream target of both MAPK and Setd2 pathways. MAPK, Setd2 and c-Myc are important regulators of HSC  proliferation and myeloid differentiation. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2-induced S100A8/A9 activates TLR4  signaling which converts to c-Myc in HSCs, resulting in loss of quiescence and self-renewal, myeloid  differentiation skewing, and long-term impairment of hematopoiesis. Since HSC is responsible for the life-long  production of blood cells, including all types of immune cells, any functional damages of HSCs would later on  have profoundly negative effects on the immune response. Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular  mechanism by which S100A8/A9 regulates HSCs and hematopoiesis would contribute a new evidence base to  accelerate advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical management of COVID-19 patients in acute infection  and recovery phases.  1",4,"4a, 4b"
P23587,"Neurotropic flavivirus dsRNA-protein interface in humans, mosquitoes and ticks","Neurotropic flaviviruses Zika virus (ZIKV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) represent major emerging arthropod-borne viruses transmitted by two different vectors, either mosquitoes or ticks. In humans, they use cells of the immune system to spread throughout the organism and can lead to severe encephalitis. During their replication, viruses produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures which is not only a necessary by-product but also performs key regulatory functions and acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognized by the host innate immune response. However, viral adaptation to such divergent host cells and organisms and their immune response, especially in arthropods, is poorly understood.   In this project, I propose to investigate and compare how neurotropic flaviviruses interact through their RNA in humans and arthropods. First, I will identify host factors involved in protein-dsRNA complexes using anti-dsRNA antibodies in a high-throughput proteomic approach from infected live arthropods and human models for immune and neuronal cells and compare the protein networks between each host. Second, I will select the most significant and relevant hits for a functional screening, further define the function of the best candidates that are either pro-viral or anti-viral, confirm their importance in most relevant models and characterize the molecular functions of the best candidates. Finally, I will identify the dsRNA structures and RNA species interacting with the best candidates, and determine the evolutionary pressure imposed on the viral genomes in each host. Altogether, this project will contribute to unravel the adaptation of neurotropic flaviviruses to their hosts throughout their cycles, both from a mechanistic and evolutionary perspective, help understand the role of the RNA in crossing species barriers and lay the grounds for new therapeutics and disease control strategies against viruses that represent an ever-increasing threat in Europe.",1,"1b, 1c"
C03165,Mental health and substance use among children and adolescents amidst COVID-19- A Systematic Review,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing measures that have been implemented worldwide have caused disruptions to the daily routines of people. Children and adolescents are generally healthy and do not require much health care outside of regular checkups. However, mental health care is very important for children and adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic may worsen existing mental health problems among children and adolescents and may lead to harmful consequences such as substance abuse. Organizations such as UNICEF and WHO have developed some tools and initiated phone lines to improve the mental health of young children during COVID-19. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have also recommended several strategies to maintain the mental wellness of young children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, not much is known about the long-term mental health effects of large-scale disease outbreaks on children and adolescents. Therefore, it is important to monitor the impact on children's and adolescent's mental health and substance use status and how to help them to improve their mental health outcomes in the time of current or future pandemic. The aim of this knowledge synthesis study is to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during the previous and current pandemic to promote children's and adolescent's mental health and to prevent substance use.",10,10a
C06680,High-throughput CRISPR-based Diagnostic Assay for Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory Diseases,"This proposal is intended to develop novel clinical diagnostics for, and increase our understanding of, thediversity, evolution, and spread of the newly emerged SARS-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and otherrespiratory disease-causing pathogens in the United States.Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with mild to severe respiratory disease, which can befatal. The novel viral etiological agent was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,China following an outbreak of pneumonia in individuals associated with a seafood market, and has sincespread globally. Originally named ""2019 novel coronavirus"", the virus has since been renamed severe acuterespiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). As of 10 February 2020, this includes 40,554confirmed cases and 910 deaths within 25 countries1. There have been 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19 inthe United States2, one of which was identified in Boston, MA in an individual who recently returned fromChina3.

As of August 4, Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) has confirmed >850 cases of COVID-19 in the tribal populations served across mainly rural northeastern Oklahoma. Community spread of COVID-19 exists throughout all 14 counties in the CN reservation, but with CN's limited capacity for community testing, screening, and contact tracing, the true impact of COVID-19 is unknown.     Roughly 34% of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults aged 18-64 years are at risk of severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities, more than any other racial/ethnic group in the US.Five counties in CN are in the top 20% of US counties for the prevalence of adults at risk of severe COVID-19due to underlying medical conditions; this vulnerability is compounded by high poverty rates and geographic barriers. People living in rural areas of CN may have to travel as many as 60 miles round-trip for viral testing.Most COVID-19 testing in CN to date has been conducted through CNHS, the largest tribally compacted health system in the US that serves all AI/AN people living within the CN reservation. Although CNHS accounts for approximately 8.5% of all IHS active user population and 38% of active user population of Oklahoma service area, not all tribal members residing in the reservation access CNHS, and therefore, may not be tested by CNHS. Other than CNHS clinics, 7 of 14 counties in this area have only one public testing site, and results maynot be returned for 2-3 weeks. CNHS and its closely integrated CN Public Health program have an exemplary 20-year record of delivering public health interventions, including a groundbreaking Hepatitis C Virus elimination program with the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, and ongoing projects with >40 rural K-12 schools. Through collaborative clinical research and molecular studies, CN and the OklahomaMedical Research Foundation have identified new immune biomarkers in tribal populations.     Drawing on these existing strengths and infrastructure, Cherokee PROTECT will   (1) Build infrastructure and increase FDA-EUACOVID-19 viral and antibody testing for clinical care in CNHS;   (2) Enable community-based COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and education with CN Public Health;   (3) Identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing in the CN reservation to inform a tailored educational campaign to increase testing and contact tracing, and decrease spread; and   (4) Implement a rigorous evaluation to ensure quality improvement and sustainability.","1, 5, 9","1a, 5a, 9b, 9c"
P23005,Biomimetic nanoparticles to enhance the breadth of influenza vaccines,"Abstract  Current influenza (flu) vaccines are effective only for closely matched flu viral strains and must be updated  annually to address constant antigenic shift/drifts of surface hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) of  the virus. Even with annual update, there have been years in which flu vaccines were ineffective due to  significant differences in antigenicity of HA and/or NA between the strains used for preparing the vaccines and  the circulating ones, leaving us at high risk of pandemics in case a new and highly pathological virus emerges.  It is without any doubt that a Ã¢Â€ÂœUniversalÃ¢Â€Â flu vaccine that can protect against both seasonal (matched or  mismatched) and pandemic flu viruses is urgently needed, but it remains Ã¢Â€Âœan alchemistÃ¢Â€Â™s dreamÃ¢Â€Â so far. We  developed a novel adjuvant by encapsulation of cGAMP, an agonist of the stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene  (STING), into pulmonary surfactant (PS)-biomimetic liposomes (PS-GMNP). The adjuvant, alongside an  inactivated flu vaccine, robustly stimulated humoral and CD8+ T cell immune responses that resemble those  ocurring during the early phase of viral infection both in magnitude and in dynamics. Strikingly, a single dose of  PS-GMNP-adjuvant flu vaccine elicited strong cross-protection against a lethal challenge of diverse  heterosubtypic flu A viruses as early as 2 days after immunization. While stimulating robust heterosubtypic  immunity, the adjuvant did not cause any adverse events in lung histology, body weight or temperature, in  sharp contrast to the severe lung inflammation and death caused by flu viral infection. In this proposal, we will  investigate the cellular and humoral immune responses essential to the cross-protection induced by PS-  GMNP-adjuvanted flu vaccines. Specifically, we will determine whether PS-GMNP can expand cross-reactive  CD8+ T cells and induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), pivotal to PS-GMNP-induced cross-  protection. In Aim 2, we will preclude any adverse effects of pre-existing immunity on the adjuvanticity of PS-  GMNP and extend the cross-protection to pre-pandemic wild type H5N1 and H7N9 viruses to establish its  clinical potentials. Distinguished from conventional adjuvants that activate primarily antigen-presenting cells  (APCs), cGAMP delivered by PS-GMNP activated both alveolar macrophages (aMÃ‰Â¸) and alveolar epithelial  cells (AEC), which can be crucial since similar activation of these two types of cells is also observed during flu  viral infection. Two alternative approaches will be employed in Aim 3 to corroborate indispensable function of  AEC and/or aMÃ‰Â¸ in PS-GMNP-mediated heterosubtypic immunity, including a blockade of cell-gap junctions  and generation of chimeric mice of wild type and STING-deficient bone marrow (BM) cells. The study, if  successful, could provide invaluable information about clinical potentials for PS-GMNP to widen the breadth of  existing flu vaccines toward a Ã¢Â€ÂœUniverseÃ¢Â€Â one, which will have a huge and immediate impact on global health.","1, 7","1d, 7a"
C10602,"Rapid, Low-cost Diagnostics and Deployable Surge Capacity for COVID-19","The outbreak of the coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, highlights the importance of the capacity for a rapid and nimble response to infectious disease.  As we have seen, the world in highly interconnected and outbreaks in one region quickly become global concerns.  Diagnostics are a key tool in the fight against spread of the virus, allowing frontline responders to quickly triage patients.  Over the past five years, our team has developed low-cost and de-centralized paper-based diagnostics that are simple to use and easy to distribute.  During the Zika virus outbreak, we developed diagnostics within weeks and have since completed patient trials in Latin America showing performance equal to the gold standard CDC tests used in clinical labs (sensitivity equal qPCR test, 98.5% accuracy).  These diagnostic, programmable by design, thus hold promise for managing future outbreaks.  Seeking to contribute to the COVID-19 outbreak response, we have already begun the development of diagnostics for the virus and anticipate having validated tools within a month.  Here we propose the following project to create a deployable diagnostic infrastructure for the virus: 1) A lab-in-a-box kit that can provide diagnostic surge capacity for COVID-19 (14,000 tests), 2) A package with the ""pop-up capacity"" to manufacture the diagnostics on-site for sustained response to the outbreak and 3) A point-of-need test for rapid screening of patients (e.g. cruise ships, airports).  Such tools are important in Canada but are especially so in countries where health care system do not have the resilience to handle a large outbreak.  We have assembled a team of researchers from four countries with expertise in virology, diagnostics technologies and delivering impactful research outcomes.  Our goal is a diagnostic platform capable of providing the capacity to respond to COVID-19 here in Canada or aboard, and the companion technologies, protocols and training to ensure effective deployment.",1,1a

P23114,Opsins and TRP channels controlling sensation and behavior in Aedes aeygpti,"Abstract  The mosquito Aedes aegypti spreads diseases such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and others that afflict >100  million people each year. These mosquitoes rely on multiple keen senses to locate human hosts for blood  meals, and for finding conspecifics for mating. Currently, we have only a rudimentary understanding of the  receptors that control these critical behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to address this gap. The  unifying theme of this proposal is to test the idea that opsins and TRP channels are two key classes of  signaling proteins that have broad roles in sensation and in controlling behavior in Ae. aegypti. Rhodopsins are  the founding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We recently discovered that opsins are multi-modal  sensory receptors, challenging 100 years of dogma that they detect only light. To find humans, female Ae.  aegypti integrate information from diverse stimuli, including CO2, visual cues, organic molecules, and  convection heat from skin. We discovered another cue. Aim 1 builds on our preliminary data that Ae. aegypti  use infrared (IR) radiation as an additional host stimulus. We outline experiments to reveal the roles of opsins  and the TRPA1 channel in IR detection. We propose to identify the IR-sensing neurons that express the opsins  and TRPA1, and to test a model to explain the role of opsins in IR sensation. To pursue this aim, we devised a  highly effective assay for monitoring IR attraction and a new molecular genetic approach to bypass difficulties  in combining multiple genetic elements. Aim 2 takes advantage of a mutation that we created in another TRP  (TRPV-A), which renders males and females deaf. We will test the roles of hearing and TRPV-A in swarm  formation, in mating, and in finding humans. Aim 2 will also build on the observations that male mating requires  audition mediated by TRPV-A to devise a strategy to overcome a major impediment limiting the efficacy of the  sterile insect technique (SIT). SIT is a promising strategy to suppress Ae. aegypti. It involves inundating a local  population with sterile males, which then render females sterile upon mating. An obstacle to using SIT is that  wild-type males outcompete sterile males. We propose that manipulation of the activity of the TRPV-A-  expressing auditory neurons elevates sterile male mating success, and will thereby increase the efficacy of SIT  in suppressing Ae. aegypti. Aim 3 concerns identifying the sensory receptors for repellents. We propose to test  the idea that an opsin functions as a highly sensitive receptor for insect repellents. If confirmed by the  proposed experiments, this would demonstrate that opsins comprise a new class of olfactory receptor. To  accomplish our goals, we have developed an extensive repertoire of state-of-the-art approaches. These  include new molecular genetic tools, a suite of behavioral assays, original video tracking software, and in vivo  electrophysiological recordings. In summary, this project will reveal the roles of opsins and TRP channels in  allowing mosquitoes to sense humans and conspecific mates. The insights gleaned from this work have  exciting potential to lead to innovative strategies to control Ae. aegypti and reduce insect-borne disease.",2,2c
C06926,METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK AS PROTECTIVE COATING FOR CANCER BIOSPECIMEN PRESERVATION,"Through this Administrative Supplement to R21CA236652, we propose to explore the applicability of a novel biospecimen preservation technology (developed as a part of the parent grant) in preserving the structure and functionality of COVID-19 patient biospecimens. COVID-19 research and clinical diagnostics rely on the availability of high-quality biofluids. Within these biofluids, the integrity of molecular biomarkers and the quality of information obtained from their analysis is highly dependent on the storage conditions during pre-analytical phase. Unfortunately, due to the poor stability of biomolecules (especially proteins) at ambient temperatures, they are prone to lose their structure and biofunctionality before analysis. Hence, an extensive distribution network of refrigeration, the ""cold chain"", is necessary to maintain an optimal temperature during transport, storage, and handling of these biospecimens. Apart from causing a huge financial and environmental burden, the cold chain system is simply not feasible in pre-hospital and resource-limited settings such as urban and rural clinics, as well as developing countries with low and moderate incomes, where refrigeration and electricity are not guaranteed. Moreover, when the biofluids are frozen, decrease in thermodynamic free energy and unfavorable ice crystal-protein interactions can occur during subsequent thawing, which can further compromise analyte integrity. The above considerations clearly suggest the need for an alternate approach for preserving molecular biomarkers in biofluids during the pre-analytical stage, preferably, without the need for refrigeration. In this exploratory project, we propose a novel approach that involves the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as encapsulants for preserving the integrity of biomarkers in biofluids under normal (nonrefrigerated) storage conditions. The approach suggested here is transformative in that it completely eliminates the need for refrigeration and avoids unwanted freeze-thaw cycles and overcomes a huge economic and environmental burden. This energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly approach not only represents a novel technique to eliminate the cold chain and temperature-controlled handling of COVID-19-related biospecimens, but also allows interruptible, storable, and restorable on-demand detection at a later time in a centralized manner/location to improve the reliability of clinical diagnostics. Towards this ultimate goal, we will develop and assess the MOF-based preservation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) in patient serum/plasma under temperature and humidity fluctuations.",11,11c
C03874,Assess and Adapt to the Impact of COVID-19 on CVD Self Management  and Prevention Care  in Adults Living with HIV (AAIM-High),"Social distancing in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and COVID-19 disease pandemic may amplifyisolation and loneliness due to the requirement to limit in-person interactions with loved ones, friends,community members, healthcare providers, etc. Social isolation increases susceptibility to illness, stress,hypertension, depression, and mortality and decreases engagement in self-management and physicalactivity. People living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and areparticularly vulnerable to the stress and social isolation caused by the public health measures to combatCOVID-19. Using mixed-methods and a human-centered design approach, we have developed and arecurrently testing in a randomized controlled trial a nurse-led intervention to EXtend the HIV/AIDSTReatment cAscade for CVD prevention (EXTRA-CVD). Racially and ethnically diverse participants onsuppressive antiretroviral therapy (n=300 total; 64 enrolled to date) with high BP AND high cholesterol from 3HIV-specialty clinics [University Hospitals, MetroHealth (both Cleveland, OH) and Duke Health (Durham, NC)]are randomized 1:1 to intervention vs. education control. In response to NOT-OD-20-757, we propose thisadministrative supplement to leverage the EXTRA-CVD platform to Assess and Adapt to the Impact ofCOVID-19 on CVD Self-Management and Prevention Care in Adults Living with HIV (AAIM-High). Theproposed activities are IRB approved and ready to begin immediately if funded. In a formative Aim 1, wewill assess the impact of COVID-19 related social distancing on HIV and CVD self-managementbehaviors among participants in EXTRA-CVD using well-validated instruments, NIH common data elementsand a sequential mixed-methods design. In Aim 2, we will conduct a hybrid type 3 implementation study toevaluate the implementation of a virtually enhanced EXTRA-CVD intervention to improve BP control inPLWH. Using a human-centered design approach, we will convene our EXTRA-CVD stakeholder DesignTeam, to refine virtual enhancements to the intervention, such as virtual adherence support groups,cardiovascular prevention specialist remote consultation, and community health worker technologycoaches. We will enroll adult PLWH participants (n=75) on suppressive ART with high BP whom are otherwiseineligible for the parent trial because they do not also have high cholesterol or because they are unwilling orunable to participate in the in-person trial. Thus, this supplemental study arm will not poach potentiallyeligible participants from the parent trial. Implementation outcomes based on a RE-AIM framework will becompared to parent trial participants: reach (% agreeing to participate), effectiveness (change in homesystolic BP), adoption (frequency of home BP use), implementation (qualitative assessment offeasibility/acceptability), and maintenance (qualitative). This supplement will increase the impact andscalability of the EXTRA-CVD study without compromising the integrity or feasibility of the parent trial.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
P21228,RAPID: Responding to a Global Pandemic--The Role of K-12 Science Teachers,"Education and Human Resources - When a global health crisis emerges, students at all levels turn to their science teachers for information and, at times, reassurance, according to researchers at Horizon Research, Inc. (HRI). Science teachers serve a critically important public health function and become an important part of the nation?s response efforts. Given the magnitude of the current COVID-19 crisis, it is likely that students are bringing their questions and concerns to their science teachers. As this award is made, nearly all K?12 school buildings in the U.S. are closed, and science teachers face unprecedented challenges in carrying out the instruction for which they are responsible while simultaneously addressing students? questions about COVID-19. Moreover, they must do this within new instructional formats. Education is crucial for helping students to understand the facts about the virus, despite much conflicting information and misinformation available. Education helps students understand and actively participate in measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. This award will support a national research study on how teachers are helping students respond to COVID-19. The findings will inform the development of curriculum materials for teaching about COVID-19, which are much needed right now, and help science teachers to adapt their instruction as they help to fulfill a critical public health function. This study will enable a better understanding of the role that science teachers can play in a national response, both now and in future crises. <br/><br/>The research will build on a study of science teachers conducted by HRI following the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Specifically, the research will investigate (1) where teachers of science get their information about coronavirus and COVID-19; (2) what types of resources teachers find most useful; (3) what factors influence whether science teachers address COVID-19 in their instruction; and (4) how science teachers adapt their teaching in response to COVID-19. HRI will recruit a nationally representative sample of several thousand K?12 teachers of science and invite them to complete a survey about their instruction related to COVID-19, both before school buildings closed and after. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, the survey will be constructed to identify factors that predict whether teachers take up the topic. The survey will also collect data about how teachers address the virus and its transmission with their students. HRI will disaggregate survey data by school-, class-, student-, and teacher-level variables to identify patterns in student opportunities. Survey data will be supplemented by interviews with 50 survey respondents to gather more in-depth information related to the constructs of interest. Study findings will be immediately shared through a preliminary report that focuses on the survey data; mainstream print media using press releases; and social media partnering with the National Science Teaching Association. HRI also will publish policy briefs intended as guidance for schools, districts, and states; and research articles.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the DRK-12 program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","9, 10","9a, 9c, 10b"
C07028,Alcohol consumption and related comorbid conditions: health state utilities for economic evaluation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Project Summary/Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a social and health environment that is previously unknown in scopeand magnitude. Health effects include mild to severe infection with SARS-coV-2; psychological trauma fromliving through a pandemic, including anxiety and depression; emotional stress from unemployment, foodinsecurity, and caretaking; and diminished social well-being due to physical distancing and restrictions inmovement. At the same time, alcohol sales have been increasing, and many states have protected access toalcohol through declaring restaurants and liquor stores as essential businesses and authorizing off-premisealcohol deliveries, mixed drinks to-go, and curbside pickup. The interplay between alcohol consumption andthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are as yet unknown: consumption may be changing in response toCOVID-19 circumstances and hazardous drinking may be increasing with negative consequences on healthand well-being, or consumption changes may be limited to the low-risk end of the spectrum with little or noeffect on well-being. This study will conduct 3 successive cross-sectional surveys of a US populationrepresentative sample to assess alcohol consumption, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and COVID-related conditions at an individual level. The resultant dataset will allow for estimates of the associationbetween alcohol consumption and HRQoL while under different conditions of COVID-19 experiences. It willallow examination of potential heterogeneity across population subgroups-varying COVID-19 conditions,varying consumption, and varying effects of the two. The study will also compare pre and during COVIDconsumption and HRQoL using prior US data from NESARC-III as a baseline, reflecting population patterns inthe 2013-14 period. As the COVID-19 pandemic is a highly dynamic situation, it is important to collect USpopulation data now to inform behavior in the early stages of response. Our results will inform alcohol policyand will enable accurate evaluation of alcohol interventions in light of the ongoing pandemic.",10,10a

C15351,Comprehensive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and escape pathways,"The ongoing global pandemic of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (CoV) presents an urgent need for development of effective preventative and treatment therapies. The viral-host cell fusion (S) protein spike is a prime target for such therapies owing to its critical role in the virus lifecycle. The S protein is divided into two regions: the N-terminal S1 domain that caps the C-terminal S2 fusion domain. Binding to host receptor via the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in S1 is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the spike by host proteases. This leads dramatic conformational transitions resulting in S1 shedding and exposure of the fusion machinery in S2, culminating in host-cell entry. Class I fusion proteins such as the CoV S protein that undergo large conformational changes during the fusion process must, by necessity, be highly flexible and dynamic. Indeed, cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike reveal considerable flexibility and dynamics in the S1 domain, especially around the RBD that exhibits two discrete conformational states - a ""down"" state that is shielded from receptor binding, and an ""up"" state that is receptor-accessible. The overall goals of this study are to use our robust,  high-throughput computational and experimental pipeline to define the detailed trajectory of the   ""down"" to ""up"" transition of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, identify early metastable intermediates in the fusion pathway, and exploit their structures and dynamics for identifying drug and vaccine candidates that target SARS-CoV-2. A wealth of structural information on CoV spike proteins, including recently determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, provides a rich source of detailed data from which to begin precise examination of macromolecular transitions underlying triggering of this fusion machine. The scientific premise of this study is that understanding the structural dynamics and early transition kinetics of mobile regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike will allow optimal control of vaccine and drug responses, and facilitate the development of novel antiviral drugs and protective vaccines. At the culmination of this study, we expect to have determined structures of multiple ""down"", ""up"", and intermediate states of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Together, these studies will provide important atomically detailed structural and mechanistic information for exploitation in vaccine and therapeutics design.",1,1b

C06686,"Hospital-Associated Respiratory Virus Infections: Molecular Epidemiology, Clinical Outcomes, and Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions - COVID-19  Administrative Supplement","PROJECT SUMMARY / Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has strained hospital capacity and led to shortages in personal protective equipmentand testing supplies. This is particularly concerning because the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 hasresulted in notable healthcare associated outbreaks, as have other novel coronaviruses such as SARS andMERS. Past studies have shown that these outbreaks are preventable with prompt diagnosis of cases andappropriate use of personal protective equipment. In the face of shortages, hospitals must make rapiddecisions on strategies to room patients, assign infection control precautions, ration personal protectiveequipment, and maintain adequate staffing. Accurate data and projections are needed to inform thesedecisions and evaluating their success is critical to managing the ongoing outbreak and informing futureresponse. This need can be met by applying the existing aims of K01AI141579 to hospital-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall objective of the existing K01 project is to support Josh Petrie, PhD in thedevelopment of expertise in healthcare epidemiology, state-of-the-art molecular methods, and advancedmodeling techniques. Completion of this objective is in progress through focused training and careerdevelopment activities in healthcare epidemiology, next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, cost-effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling that is overseen by an excellent team of mentors. The skillsthat are being developed by the training and career development objectives are strengthened by mentoredresearch to accomplish the following Specific Aims: (1) Define the epidemiology and burden of community-acquired and hospital-associated respiratory virus infections and compare clinical impact by viral species; (2)Improve the sensitivity and specificity of case definitions to identify hospital-associated respiratory virus casesby integrating clinical, epidemiologic, and molecular data; and (3) Determine the cost-effectiveness ofincreased respiratory virus screening and expanded infection control measures to reduce HA-RVI usingmathematical models. The proposed administrative supplement will facilitate application of these aims tohospital-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection. The expected research outcomes of the proposed project are, 1)determination of the incidence and outcomes of hospital-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections; 2) improvedidentification of hospital-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections through integration of clinical, epidemiologic, andmolecular data; and 3) quantification of the effects of COVID-19 response strategies in the hospital on theincidence of hospital-associated SARS-CoV-2.

P22499,Longitudinal Characterization of Postnatal Brain Maturation after Fetal Zika Infection,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The Brazilian Zika virus outbreak of 2016 initiated an international public health crisis when it became clear that  babies infected in utero were being born with devastating neurological defects. In addition, troubling reports have  shown that many infected babies present as Ã¢Â€Âœneurologically-normalÃ¢Â€Â at birth but experience later atypical  developmental and neurosensory alterations into infancy. The long-term developmental consequences of Zika  infection are currently unknown, but mechanisms of its pathobiology have been linked to the preferential injury  of axons and myelin. Disrupted or delayed myelination in early life has been previously associated to significant  and permanent impairments across domains of sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities. To investigate the impact  of fetal Zika infection on postnatal brain development, this study will acquire quantitative magnetic resonance  imaging metrics of myelin and axon maturation in an established nonhuman primate model at 6, 12, 24, and 30  months of age (equivalent up to ~ age 10 in humans). This proposed work, therefore, takes a novel approach by  tracking whole brain changes in tissue microstructure, in vivo, in an accelerated model of brain development and  links those changes to cellular anatomy, post mortem. Behavioral outcomes related to axon and myelin injury  will also be investigated. The aims of this proposal have been designed for direct translation to human studies  and will establish a valuable resource for predicting and interpreting outcomes of fetal Zika infection.",4,"4b, 4d"
C06866,Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19,"Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented morbidity and mortality.Risk factors like age, obesity, and comorbidity impact the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 leading to hospital ICU admission and death. Additional risk factors that promote exaggerated immune andinflammatory response to the virus leading to severe disease or death must exist. One such risk factor couldbe alcohol consumption because: (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States. (2) Patientshospitalized for pneumonia who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk for developing AcuteRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (the primary cause of death in COVID-19) than non-AUD patients; and(3) Alcohol negatively impacts function of the immune system and results in an inappropriate response topathogens (a primary mechanism of severe COVID-19 and ARDS); and (4) Alcohol disrupts the intestinalmicrobiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal and lung barriers which can both further promote inflammation andcontribute to ARDS. Accordingly, we hypothesize that alcohol misuse is an independent risk factor thatincreases the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by promoting exaggerated and dysregulated immune-inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage our COVID-19 data and biorepository at RushUniversity Medical Center (RUMC), which has tested over 22,000 patients (68% minority) with over 6000patients testing positive, over 1000 hospitalized, over 600 critically ill. Currently, all patients arriving at RUMCare screened for alcohol use with AUDIT. Our COVID-19 biorepository has banked nasopharyngeal swabs,serum/plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We will address the following Specific Aims:Aim 1: Determine if alcohol use or misuse increases severity of COVID-19 and elucidate interactionswith other risk factors. In this cross sectional study, we will use a machine learning classifier to determine ifincreased alcohol use/misuse are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poorer COVID-19health outcomes (in 12,000 RUMC, 6000 COVID-19+) patients. Aim 2. Determine the impact of alcohol useand misuse on COVID-19 disease course and the impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption. In thislongitudinal study, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of alcohol use in 6000 patients positive for COVID-19to determine: (2a) if alcohol use/misuse is associated with slower recovery from COVID-19-associatedsymptoms. Aim 3. Determine if alcohol misuse results in exaggerated immune-inflammatory responseto SARS-CoV-2 infection and more organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and explore themechanisms. In this mechanistic Aim, we will compare COVID-19 patients with different disease severity todetermine if alcohol misuse is associated with: (3a) altered immune/inflammatory response.

We will use machine learning and other advanced informatics approaches toinvestigate these Aims to discover new mechanisms for alcohol-COVID-19 interactions for prevention andtherapeutic targets for COVID-19.","3, 4","3b, 4a, 4b, 4c"
C10750,Deciphering the immunopeptidomic landscape of COVID-19 disease,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Between December 2019 and September 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had infected more than 30M people and killed more than 1M. Ease of transmission combined with disease severity have led leaders around the world to restrict individual movements and promote physical distancing measures to limit the spread. Therefore, rapid delivery of safe and efficient vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is the top priority. Importantly, the development of efficient vaccines can be accelerated by a clear understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 targets that are recognized by the human immune system. Until now, very limited information is available about those targets. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating as the pandemic persists, but it is unclear how those mutations influence the ability of the immune system to eliminate the virus. Here, we propose to deploy an innovative viral epitope discovery platform to identify those mutated and non-mutated targets in a rapid, systematic and unbiased manner. The proposed research will therefore assist vaccine design and will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine candidates as they advance in the clinic.",1,1c
C00241,"Rapid, Ultrasensitive Clinical Detection of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCOVID-19) by Novel Microfluidic Electrochemical Nano-Biosensors [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement]","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in the city of Wuhan, in China and has spread widely, including Canada. In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection has dramatically increased. Currently, 20-25% of confirmed cases have severe clinical presentations. With no vaccines nor specific treatments, early confirmation before progression to late stages would provide more time for effective supportive treatment. The traditional detection process requires that samples from sick individuals be transported to laboratories for manual processing. This is extremely inefficient and introduces a significant time-delay that has severe consequences for disease spread. Since January 2020, tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients. However, despite the high sensitivity of these methods, they are not suitable for rapid and large-scale screening for multiple samples because of their long analysis time. Moreover, these methods need skilled personal to perform and not suitable for point-of-care testing. Most of these assays have not been yet adopted for COVID-19. The objective of this project is to develop a novel diagnostic tool for rapid detection of early-stage COVID-19.

C09953,#ReachIn: A rapid review of informal Social Support Interventions for victim & survivors of domestic violence & abuse,"This project aims to improve outcomes for victim-survivors of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) by advancing knowledge about informal social support interventions. The pandemic has highlighted the challenges that policing, health and frontline services face in seeking to identify and support victims-survivors of DVA. Anecdotal evidence suggests that victims have been less able and/ or willing to seek help from traditional first responders (Peterman et al., 2020) whilst more informal sources of support have faced increased demands: Refuge saw a 700% increase in the number of visits to their Helpline website during the initial lockdown (ONS, 2020).     Interventions that aid informal networks (such as family, friends, neighbours and community groups) can therefore play a critical role (Sanchez et al., 2020). For those 'living with domestic abuse... the view from outside, from supportive friends, family and neighbours, is so important' (DVA Survivor, SafeLives), with the potential to improve mental and physical health outcomes for victims of DVA (Coker et al., 2004; Goodman et al., 2011). Yet, very little is known about interventions that promote, enhance, or create informal social support for adults affected by DVA.    This project will review existing research to identify effective informal social support interventions and how they 'work'. A systematic rapid review will identify, describe, appraise and synthesize evidence to understand whether, and how, informal social support interventions can improve outcomes for victims and survivors of DVA. In collaboration with stakeholders, these findings will then be translated into practical, real-world guidance for friends, families and communities, as well as DVA practitioners. The collaboration between UCL and SafeLives will ensure relevance, methodological rigour, and UK-wide reach of the project and outputs. SafeLives' #ReachIn campaign will serve as a vehicle for engaging key audiences and maximising benefits now, in the recovery phase of the pandemic, and beyond.",10,10b
C00055,Development of a nanoparticle-based vaccine candidate to the SARS-CoV-2 [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus in the province of Wuhan in China is an international concern since there is a risk for  spreading the infection outside the Chinese territory. The spreading of the virus is facilitated by its human to human transmission by aerosols. Several approaches must be taken to limit the spread of the virus, including quarantine, the decontamination of infected areas, early detection in patients, etc. It is also widely recognized that vaccination is from far the most efficient approach to control the spreading of the infection and protect the population. We propose first the development of a vaccine component-1 to the SARS- CoV-2 based on the use of an immune enhancer nanoparticle coupled to peptides derived from the virus nucleocapsid. This vaccine will trigger a protective immune response against the virus. The use of peptide antigens allows moving very fast in the development of the vaccine candidate. Besides the speed, this approach has the merit to induce a broad CTL immune response that should also trigger protection to any strains of the virus that are related to the Wuhan virus, like the SARS virus of 2002. Second, we will design and prepare a second vaccine component that will elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2. Finally, both components will be combined in one vaccine formulation that will provide robust protection to the SARS-CoV-2 and also to related viruses, like the SRAS virus of 2002. The nanoparticles used to attach the vaccine antigens are very stable. The coupling to the nanoparticle will stabilize the antigens and generate a very stable vaccine formulation that can be stockpiled for a long period (years) without loss of integrity. This is an advantage because to insure preparedness to other epidemics with related viruses.",7,7a
C06104,Use of human lung tissue explants to analyse immunomodulatory approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 (CoIMMUNE),"COVID-19 is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than two million humans and caused over 150.000 deaths worldwide. A vaccine and treatments are not available, which urges the development of new treatments, strategies to limit viral replication and to reduce new infections.     SARS-CoV-2 induces a biphasic immune imbalance, characterized by the lack of a proper innate immune response in the early phase and the development of hypercytokinemia in the later phase. Here, we propose that application of human IFN-a subtypes or inhibitors of the immune regulatory kinase p38 provide realistic strategies to achieve either activation of the innate immune response in the early and the reduction of overshooting responses in the late phase, respectively.     For rapid translation into clinical treatments, repurposing of pre-evaluated drugs and the use of pre-clinical study models should be conducted. This project employs human lung tissue to provide the first pre-clinical assessment of the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of human IFN-a subtypes to identify the best candidate(s) to reduce viral replication and limit viral trasmission. In addition, we will deliver a pre-clinical testing of three pre-developed p38 inhibitors to provide experimental evidence that the overshooting cytokine response can be rebalanced by p38 inhibition and IC50 values in human lung tissue to allow rapid application in COVID-19 patients. This project has the potential to identify new efficient treatment options for COVID-19 suitable for translation into clinical applications.",1,"1d, 1b"

P23348,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 response on malaria control and malaria burden,"The rapid global emergence and spread of COVID-19 is having extensive effects on the health of populations and health systems worldwide and is threatening fragile health systems in many resource-poor countries. When responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to ensure that efforts to control other endemic diseases, such as malaria, are not ignored. Between 2000 and 2015, the massive scale-up of malaria vector control interventions, including long-lasting insecticidal nets, and effective treatment of clinical malaria cases, led to a 50% reduction in malaria cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. There are concerns that tackling COVID-19 will disrupt malaria control efforts, leading to a resurgence in malaria and undermining progress to date.     This project investigates the social and public health response to COVID-19 in Tanzania and assesses the impacts of the pandemic on malaria prevention and control at the community and health system levels. The team will identify gaps in the delivery and uptake of malaria interventions in the context of COVID-19. Real-time data on individual behaviours and the effects on health systems will inform locally adapted malaria control strategies.

P23187,"Creating high-resolution, epitope-focused vaccines","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT   The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to establish a novel method for  creating vaccines. These vaccines will lead to a highly focused antibody response toward  particular epitopes that are known to be the targets of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs). If successful, this approach could be applied broadly for the creation of important, new  vaccines that protect against infectious disease.   The ability to focus the antibody response toward particular epitopes would permit  vaccines to be created that elicit neutralizing antibodies, instead of non-neutralizing antibodies.  It would also permit creation of vaccines that lead to an antibody response directed against  highly conserved regions of an infectious agent, leading to broad spectrum protection against  different strains and minimizing the possibility of Ã¢Â€ÂœescapeÃ¢Â€Â by mutant variants.   The key starting material for the approach is a mAb that is broadly neutralizing against  the infectious agent. In recent decades, many potent, broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnAbs) have  been isolated and characterized in detail. Some of these bnAbs (for example, that target  influenza virus, Ebola virus and HIV-1) have entered clinical trials to test their efficacy in treating  infectious disease and/or to determine whether passively infused mAb can prevent infection.  Despite major research funding, however, it has generally not been possible to create vaccines  that are capable of eliciting antibodies with properties such as these bnAbs.   Here, a simple but radically different approach for creating epitope-focused vaccine  candidates is utilized that leverages a tool that has been available all along Ã¢Â€Â"" the mAb itself.  First, binding of the mAb is used to protect the target epitope. Next the surface of the remainder  of the antigen is modified to render it non-immunogenic. Finally, the protecting mAb is removed,  thereby deprotecting and exposing the unmodified, target epitope. The method is called protect,  modify, deprotect (or PMD). Ultimately, this high-risk, high-reward proposal could enable  creation of vaccines that elicit an antibody response against any given mAb epitope, and only  that epitope.",7,7i

P22080,Zika virus nonstructural protein 5 inhibition of interferon signaling,"PROJECT SUMMARY  All vector-borne flavivirus NS5 proteins suppress host type I interferon (IFN) signaling, which is critical to  successfully infecting humans and causing disease. Inhibitors of this function of NS5 or viruses engineered to  lack this activity may be effective antiviral therapies and attenuated vaccines, respectively. However, a deeper  understanding of how the flavivirus NS5 protein acts to suppress IFN is needed. Despite the importance of  inhibiting IFN signaling, and the high degree of sequence conservation between NS5 proteins within this genus,  flaviviruses have evolved numerous distinct ways to antagonize this innate immune response. Many flavivirus  NS5 proteins, including those of dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, inhibit the Signal  Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 2 (STAT2) protein, which is a transcription factor that mediates IFN  signaling. In this application, we propose to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the ZIKV NS5-STAT2  interface by defining the essential viral and host genetic determinants for this interaction at the highest possible,  single amino acid, resolution through deep mutational scanning (DMS). In Aim 1, we will screen libraries of all  possible single amino acid ZIKV NS5 variants for the ability to suppress IFN signaling. We will examine these  determinants in a range of flaviviruses to understand functional conservation and mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will  identify how STAT2 genetics impact the ability of ZIKV NS5 to suppress IFN signaling and mediate infection.  Finally, in Aim 3 we will define how ZIKV NS5 induces the degradation of human STAT2 by identifying the STAT2  sites where NS5 induces ubiquitination and the host factors ZIKV NS5 recruits to mediate this modification. The  results of this project will provide in-depth insights into flavivirus host cell interactions and replication mechanisms  that may aid in the development of therapies for ZIKV, and could perhaps be further applied in combating other  future virus outbreaks.",1,"1b, 1c, 1d"

C07226,Communities Fighting COVID!,"PROJECT Summary: The novel SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in the United States, with almost 5 million confirmed cases of andover 150,000 deaths. Given observed disparities in morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality across race, ethnicity,and socioeconomic status, there is a great need to increase testing access and uptake with rapid return of test results.     We propose a community health worker (CHW)-led approach to facilitate COVID-19 testing for underserved populations, with a focus on increasing testing access, uptake, and impact among Latinx, African American, Filipino, and immigrant communities using different testing implementation strategies.     Our project will utilize existing COVID-19 contact tracing and community partner infrastructure to reach individuals aged 12 and above exposed or at high-risk of COVID-19 exposure who may be less able to test. We will use a cluster randomized crossover trial to test mobile and home-based testing strategies for increasing testing uptake among contacts, referred high-risk friends and family, and the broader community.     Our specific aims are to:   1) Implement COVID-19 testing integrated into community health worker contact tracing home visits and compare the subsequent uptake of testing for referred high-risk friends and family in a mobile testing vs. home-based testing approach;   2) Using a community-led rapid cycle research process, identify effective strategies to promote uptakeof COVID-19 testing through mobile/pop-up testing for Latinx, African American, Filipino, and immigrant populations exposed or at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 who are not accessing testing;   3) Gather CHW and community insights to establish best practices for future scale-up and sustainability.     We expect to test over 40,000 individuals through these efforts. The project will contribute to health disparity reductions in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and produce high impact through the our core strengths in drawing on local knowledge,the team's existing community partnerships, use of culturally-competent community healthcare workers, point-of-care rapid and inexpensive testing, and the use of real-time geospatial data from our contact tracing program to prioritize locations for mobile pop-up testing. Our focus on underserved populations with high COVID-19 exposures without prior testing access will inform both future testing and vaccination efforts.","4, 5, 9","4c, 5a, 9a, 9b, 9c"

There is an urgent need for tailored COVID-19 responses with refugee/displaced persons. We address knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19 prevention in humanitarian contexts. We focus on urban refugee/displaced youth in Uganda, where 1.4 million refugees are hosted-Sub-Saharan Africa's largest refugee hosting nation and the 3rd largest globally. Our study is located in Kampala, Uganda that hosts 90,000 urban refugee/displaced persons living in informal settlements. Adolescents and youth comprise half of the world's 70.8 million refugee/displaced persons yet are understudied in pandemics.

C04114,GCRF_NF101: Internally Displaced Persons and COVID-19: Leveraging local low cost COVID-19 solutions in informal settlements in Zimbabwe,"This project focuses on Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) residing in informal settlements in Harare, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is among the latest countries in the region to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst the government has responded well to the pandemic, it is currently preoccupied with returning citizens, some of whom are testing positive on arrival, leading to increasing numbers in infection cases. The system is neglecting the plight of secluded populations such as IDPs, most of whom are of a migrant/refugee heritage and were victims of developmental displacement programmes (e.g. the infamous land reform programme) who lack resources and access to critical public health information. Bringing together an interdisciplinary team of two UK universities, three Zimbabwe universities and a local NGO, this impact-oriented project aims to complement the government's current response to the pandemic by adapting locally developed low cost COVID-19 solutions to fit IDPs' needs.  Objectives are to:    1. identify through research what IDPs know about COVID-19, sources of the knowledge and current preventive/protective measures and the gaps;  2. adapt the recent low cost COVID-19 innovations (e.g. sanitisers and facemasks) developed by our co-investigator university, Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University, to fit the IDPs context;  3. develop a COVID-19 transformative public health education programme to be accessed through diverse interactive communication channels;   4. produce a toolkit and provide training through media to empower women to make COVID-19 protective products for use by their households;   5. produce policy briefs for engaging relevant government departments to include IDPs in their development plans.","5, 9","5b, 9a, 9c"
C09550,Expanding population-level interventions to help more low-income smokers quit,"ABSTRACTMany low-income Americans, racial and ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups live in information-poor environments, disproportionately exposed to misinformation about COVID-19, and distrusting medical,government and scientific institutions and leaders. These and other social, cultural and behavioral factors posesignificant obstacles to public health efforts to increase population testing and vaccination in a pandemic.Effective health communication is urgently needed to help counter these challenges and reduce disparities inCOVID-19's impact. Working in close partnership with 2-1-1 helplines in four states and nationwide, wepropose rapid-cycle research that moves from audience analysis to message testing among prioritypopulations identified in the NOSI. Our approach builds on strong evidence from our team's decades-longprogram of health communication research to eliminate disparities, especially proven message tactics such ascultural values, disparity framing, and narratives, that will be applied to the COVID-19 context. Specifically, wewill conduct a multi-method content analysis of 43,000+ COVID-19 testing inquiries to 2-1-1 (Aim 1), surveyand interview 350 2-1-1 callers and phone operators (Aim 2), and develop and evaluate in randomized A-Btesting new COVID-19 testing messages among 300 2-1-1 callers (Aim 3). Taken together, these activities willidentify essential context and content for communicating about COVID-19 testing to vulnerable populations,integrate this knowledge into proven message tactics, and determine their impact on interest in and intention tobe tested and other key outcomes. Our partnership with 2-1-1s is central to the proposed research. Of the 24priority populations identified in the NOSI, 2-1-1s serve a higher proportion of callers from nearly every groupcompared to their proportion of the U.S. population, including 60-80% racial or ethnic minorities, 40-55% withhousehold income below $10,000, and 1 in 4 not completing high school. During COVID-19, 2-1-1s in 36states have fielded 964,286 COVID-19 requests. These first-hand accounts from underserved Americansconcerned about or affected by COVID-19 must inform communication efforts, and the infrastructure of 2-1-1 iswell suited to support rapid testing of promising approaches.",9,"9a, 9c"
C07347,Understanding the financial impact of COVID-19 on the UK care home sector - implications for businesses and the workforce,"This project addresses the impact of COVID-19's on the care home sector including the consequence for the workforce and users while assessing its financial viability, as well as requirements for recovery and resilience. The UK depends on the financial sustainability of the mainly privately-owned care home sector, which cares for over 400,000 older people. Prior to the pandemic, the Competition and Markets Authority 2017 report highlighted the financial fragility of the sector. It is clear that COVID-19 has exacerbated financial pressures on care homes, potentially leading to highly disruptive closures. Although there is a growing understanding of the additional costs to the care home sector attributable to COVID-19, there is a lack of knowledge about the implications for the financial sustainability of the sector as a whole, as well as for different types of organisation (e.g. large chains, charities, family-run care homes). Yet, it is essential for policy makers to comprehend these financial impacts if they are to design effective interventions to ensure the stability of care home provision, maintain safe standards of care and deliver good quality services. This new research will complement the analysis of care costs being undertaken by other relevant research conducted by the ESRC Sustainable Care programme. According to the 2019 report produced by the Skills for Care charity, the 600,000-strong care home workforce is characterised by low pay, high staff turnover and vacancy rates, and reliance on migrant labour. Given the difficulties in recruiting and retaining care home workers prior to the pandemic, policy makers also need to understand and address the financial impact of COVID-19 on staff experiences and efforts to retain staff.",10,"10a, 10c"
P22576,Complete mapping of the functional and antigenic effects of mutations to Lassa virus glycoprotein,"Project Summary/Abstract   Despite many medical advances, viruses continue to cause significant human disease. Viral infections  are difficult to prevent or treat in large part due to the rapid evolution of viral entry proteins. Mutations in these  proteins can permit viruses to infect new hosts (including humans), better spread between hosts, and evade  immune responses and some therapeutics. The Bloom lab has developed high-throughput tools to completely  characterize the effects of all single amino-acid mutations to the viral entry proteins from influenza and HIV.  These tools have proven very powerful for better understanding how these viruses evolve and how they  escape from antibodies proposed for clinical use. However, current tools cannot be easily applied to other  viruses, including most emerging viruses.   To better understand the effects of mutations to viral entry proteins from emerging viruses, I am  developing a general platform for the high-throughput characterization of mutations to viral entry proteins.  Based on a pseudotyped lentiviral system, this platform allows me to study the viral entry proteins from most  enveloped viruses. I will leverage this system, along with the high-throughput tools already developed in the  Bloom lab, to measure the effects of all amino-acid mutations to the viral entry proteins from emerging viruses.   Specifically, I will use my platform to characterize the effects of mutations to the Lassa virus entry  protein from several strains of Lassa virus. Understanding the effects of mutations to the viral entry protein  from divergent lineages of Lassa virus will be important for determining how the diversity of this virus affects  the development of a broadly-protective treatment or vaccine. To further address the question of antibody  therapeutic development, I will completely characterize the ability of mutations to the Lassa virus entry protein  to mediate antibody escape from three human monoclonal antibodies currently undergoing therapeutic  development. These complete maps of antibody resistance will determine from which antibody it is most  difficult for the virus to escape and help evaluate and refine potential antibody immunotherapies.   Overall, I will develop a general method to characterize the effects of mutations to viral entry proteins,  including those from emerging viruses. I will then leverage this approach to study the Lassa virus entry protein,  gaining actionable insight into Lassa virus entry protein function and antibody escape.",1,1c

P22094,RIPK3-dependent suppression of excitotoxicity during neuronal flavivirus infection,"Abstract   While neurons were previously believed to be immunologically inert, recent advances have redefined  our understanding of the intrinsic immunological activity of this cell type. Notably, neurons exhibit robust innate  immune responses to viral infection, often employing adaptations of antiviral processes that reflect their unique  cell biology. We and others recently described one such adaptation, in which activation of receptor interacting  protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) in neurons during flavivirus infection does not result in necroptotic cell death, the  canonical function of this protein. Instead, neuronal RIPK3 activation drives a cell death-independent  transcriptional program that includes a broad variety of antiviral and immunoregulatory genes. However, while  roles for RIPK3 in coordinating neuronal inflammatory responses are now established, the potential impact of  RIPK3 activation on other features of neuronal cell biology, including neurotransmission, remain unexplored. In  preliminary experiments, we have shown that RIPK3 activation following neuronal Zika virus infection supports  expression of a broad class of genes involved in synapse regulation, including neurotransmitter receptor  trafficking and internalization. We also show that increased neuronal cell death and animal mortality in neuron  cultures and mice lacking RIPK3 can be rescued by pharmacologic blockade of the ionotropic glutamate receptor  NMDAR. We thus hypothesize that RIPK3 protects neuronal viability during Zika virus infection via suppression  of NMDAR-dependent excitotoxic cell death. We will test this idea using an innovative combination of  pharmacogenetics, imaging, molecular biology, and electrophysiological approaches. If successful, these  studies will define a new, pro-survival function for a canonical cell death protein in neurons, as well as bring new  clarity to the impact of innate immune signaling on neurotransmission.",1,"1b, 1e"

P22679,New Nasal Spray Influenza Vaccine for Children,"New Nasal Spray Influenza Vaccine for Children  Project Summary   Influenza is still a global public health problem for children despite a vigorous campaign for influenza  vaccination in many countries. Recent emergence of the COVID-19 can also complicate influenza in children  and make it more desirable to vaccinate young children against influenza. Influenza vaccines must be  reformulated annually because of the antigenic shift and drift of circulating influenza viral strains. However,  reformulated seasonal flu vaccines do not always match the circulating strains, and there is the ever-present  threat that avian influenza viruses may adapt for transmission in humans. Additionally, currently available  antiviral drugs against influenza are facing the twin challenges of evolved drug resistance and nonspecific side  effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing novel drugs, vaccines, and combinatory therapies  against influenza virus infection.   In this proposed research, we hypothesize that a universally prophylactic and therapeutic influenza vaccine  for children can be developed through creation of a self-attenuated influenza virus (SAIV) that expresses artificial  microRNAs (amiRNAs) targeting viral and/or host gene expression that are essential for viral replication. In order  to evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following 3 specific aims for this research:   Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a candidate prophylactic and therapeutic SAIV vaccine generated  by viral gene-targeted attenuation.   Specific Aim 2: To assess the efficacy of a candidate SAIV vaccine generated by host gene-targeted  attenuation.   Specific Aim 3: To produce and evaluate additional dual viral and host factor-targeted prophylactic and  therapeutic SAIV vaccines.   Our proposed SAIV vaccines developed in this research will be extensively investigated in young mouse  model of influenza infection. We anticipate that the proposed research will identify a novel and safe universal  influenza vaccine and molecular therapy that could be further developed as a therapeutic vaccine to prevent  future influenza reinfection in children. Furthermore, this research program will significantly strengthen the  research environment in Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso, and provide research training  opportunities for 3 graduate students, 3 medical students, and 3 undergraduate students, respectively,  throughout the 3-year performance period.",7,7a
C14383,Air quality benefits from multi-year changes in post-pandemic working and travel patterns,"Air quality is significantly affected by levels of economic activity and wider patterns of industrial and domestic consumption. Whilst lower air pollution was frequently reported as a short-term consequence of lockdown, less well quantified are the potential longer term improvements in urban air quality that may arise from more sustained shifts in behavioural patterns during the recovery phase and beyond. For example, these may arise from changed commuting modes, office and school times, and continuation of homeworking. Altered air pollution emissions in cities, even if only sustained for a few years, may deliver disproportionately front-loaded benefits. As the UK transitions towards transport electrification and older vehicles leave the fleet, it is in the years immediately following the pandemic that the largest benefits to air quality are likely to be felt. Lower air pollution during the lockdown phase of the pandemic was not surprising, with NO2 falling widely across the UK. More surprising has been the recent divergence between increasing traffic volumes and the rebound in pollution as restrictions on society have lifted. Understanding the mechanisms behind this, and the potential air quality and public health opportunities, lies at the heart of this proposal. This research is ideally conducted at a time once most the significant lockdown restrictions have been lifted and specifically once schools (and their related transport have resumed). It is therefore timed to begin towards the end of 2020. The real-world impacts of this research may be highly significant, allowing an evaluation changing urban emissions regimes.",10,10d

The system level, which includes plans to handle an overwhelming number of patients, organization of units to avoid transmission to health care workers and other patients, systems for testing, tracing and isolation, as well as patient pathways through the health care system. 2. The clinical level, which includes knowledge about risk factors for severe illness, and mitigation of modifiable risk factors.     The primary study objective is to investigate the effect of organization strategies and handling of risk factors for the outcome of patients in primary care during the COVID-19 outbreak.  Secondary objectives are to:  1.	Identify patient management strategies in primary care and how this is organized in the municipalities in Norway during COVID-19 outbreak.  2.	Identify patient management strategies in European countries during the COVID-19 outbreak.  3.	Describe patient contacts to out-of-hours (OOH) services and action taken, and to compare the contacts and action taken between municipalities in Norway during COVID-19 outbreak.  4.	Examine how the COVID-19 patient utilize the health care system in Norway and identify different trajectories for COVID-19 patient outcome, compared with other patients.  5.	Investigate risk factors for severe outcomes of COVID-19 among primary care patients in Norway.    Objective 1 and 2 will be answered by questionnaire data from all OOH services in Norway and OOH services in collaborating European countries.  Objective 3 will be answered by use of data from the Watchtower Registry with information from seven representative OOH services in Norway.    Objective 4 and 5 will be answered by use of linked data from the Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care (KPR), the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR), the Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases (MSIS), the Norwegian Prescription","4, 11","4a, 4c, 11a, 11y"

C15282,VPS34 inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals,"Summary  SARS-CoV-2, a Betacoronavirus genus, is an enveloped positive-sense, RNA virus responsible  for a current pandemic. Because of its profound impact on society and human health there is an  urgent need to understand SARS-CoV-2 replication requirements and to identify therapeutic  strategies. Repurposing drugs developed for other purposes may provide a shortcut to therapeutic  development. The use of compounds known to target specific host factors may also elucidate key  pathways needed for virus replication. Coronavirus (CoV) replication involves multiple critical  interactions with host cell membranes. One of the most striking features of CoV infection is the  establishment of membrane-associated replication organelles that serve as the main sites of viral  RNA synthesis. The origin of these membrane organelles is incompletely understood. Because  the specific host pathways required for SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle formation are not  defined, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to modulators of lipid metabolism by  assessing the sensitivity of the virus to VPS34 inhibitors of VPS34, a lipid kinase required for  autophagy and endosomal trafficking; Triacsin C, an inhibitor of long chain fatty acyl CoA  synthetase (ACSL) and Orlistat, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FASN). Our preliminary data  indicate that inhibitors of VPS34 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas an FDA-  approved inhibitor of a different class of PI3K had minimal effect on replication. Targeting FASN  and ACSL also impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication. These data suggest that VPS34, ACSL and  FASN play important roles in replication center formation and virus growth and suggest these  enzymes as therapeutic targets. We will test the hypothesis that VPS34, ACSL and FASN are  critical for SARS-Cov-2 infection by evaluating additional small molecule inhibitors of these  enzymes and by measuring SARS-CoV-2 replication in genetic knockdowns or knockouts of these  host enzymes. We will define mechanisms of inhibition and test the hypothesis that generation  of membrane-associated viral replication centers will be disrupted. Finally, we will assess the in  vivo efficacy of VSP34 inhibitor PIK-III and systemically administered Orlistat in SARS-coV-2-  infected hamsters to evaluate the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of lipid metabolism.",6,6a
C10761,Proof of concept of wastewater-based surveillance for SARS-COV2 to mitigate secondary COVID-19 disease transmission in First Nations in Alberta,"We propose to track SARS-COV2 in the wastewater (WW) in targeted First Nations in Treaty 7 in Central/Southern Alberta. SARS-COV2 genetic material is excreted in the poop from infected individuals, often before symptoms start. Our research team has developed and deployed methods within an urban setting with centralized sewage for WW processing and for quantifying the amount of this signal. We will leverage this information to build a surveillance program with partnered First Nations to translate and mobilize monitoring into rapid community responses, enabling community-based targeted screening, isolation of households/groups and supportive distancing- thereby mitigating secondary spread.   We will accomplish the following; 1. Develop procedures for efficiently collecting and transporting WW samples from communities to a central laboratory. 2.  Within 48 hours multiple SARS-COV2 RNA markers and controls will be quantitatively processed to assess COVID-19 trends. 3. Develop a collaborative model in which real-time data is shared between public health experts and community leaders. 4.  Develop health and technical tools to help contain secondary infections (ie, community spread) once a potential cluster has been identified, including preparing Knowledge Keepers and primary care teams with technical knowledge, and linking understanding of community vulnerability based on access to basic infrastructure.  Our trans-disciplinary team brings together Indigenous leaders, Alberta Health Services, and University subject matter experts from the Faculties of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Co-leads include scholars who work in close partnership with First Nations on health and infrastructure-related initiatives that intersect with COVID-19 responses. Together, we have extensive experience with OCAP™ principles-aligned research and funding in partnership with First Nations, and are therefore in a position to engage eligible Nations to partner on this initiative.",3,"3a, 3c"
C00132,Development of a novel DC-targeting vaccine that targets COVID-19 spike protein to control COVID-19 infection [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"COVID-19 is a coronavirus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness that was first detected in Wuhan, China. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection. The spike protein (SP) of the virus is the key molecule for entry into a cell and is a main target of host protective immune responses. A receptor-binding domain (RBD) located in SP is essential for the infection of COVID-19. Previous studies have demonstrated that RBD of SARS-CoV consists of multiple neutralizing epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The neutralizing antibody can bind to SARS-CoV and interferes with its ability to infect a cell. These findings suggest that RBD of COVID-19 is an ideal anti-COVID-19 vaccine candidate.   Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play critical roles to efficiently present viral antigens to the T cells of the immune system. Therefore, targeting DCs is a promising strategy to improve vaccine effectiveness. Recently, we have developed a highly efficient DC-targeted vaccination technology, and in this study, we will use this vaccination technology to expose the RBD of COVID-19 to host immune system. We will also investigate the potential of this novel vaccine approach to elicit potent immune responses against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV infections in vivo. The success of this proposed study will lay the groundwork for the quick development and production of anti-COVID-19 vaccine candidates, and contribute to a rapid response towards controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China and worldwide",7,7a
C09554,GS-441524 is Pharmacodynamically Equivalent to Remdesivir and Pharmacokinetically Superior Drug for the Treatment of COVID-19,"ABSTRACT. Covid-19 is a once in a generation epidemic that has had dire, destabilizing impacts across theworld. While remdesivir has emerged as the only drug with proven efficacy, its widespread distribution has beenplagued by supply-shortages. Careful review of pre-clinical data evidence that these problems largely derivefrom the poorly optimized phosphate pro-drug moieties on remdesivir, which ultimately make manufacturingremdesivir more difficult. Careful review of the literature indicates that, its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, is likelythe more optimal Covid-19 drug. We hypothesize that GS-441524 is pharmacodynamically equivalent drug toremdesivir, in its ability to generate active nucleotide triphosphate to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase.In addition to GS-441524 being significantly easier to synthesize, we contend that its direct administration would enable homogenous tissue distribution of active nucleotide triphosphate inhibitor compared to remdesivir; higherlevels of inhibitor would ultimately be achieved in lung epithelial cells most afflicted by SARS-CoV-2.This proposal will make fundamental biochemical advances at the in vitro level and therapeutic advancementsat the in vivo level. We will compare the rates bioactivation of GS-4441524 and remdesivir across a broad panelof primary human cell types and delineate the exact molecular mechanism and enzymes which bio-transformremdesivir and GS-441524 into the active triphosphate species. At the same time, we will establishpharmacodynamic equivalence between GS-441524 and remdesivir in mice and non-human primates. Finally,we will demonstrate that GS-441524 is ultimately superior to remdesivir in vivo for generating active triphosphateinhibitor, when each is administered at their maximum tolerated doses. Should our hypotheses prove correct,these data will support GS-441524 for IND and clinical trials.",6,6a
C03634,Perceived Risk and Precautions during a Pandemic Outbreak,"During a pandemic, the behaviour of the general population determines the spread of the contagion, the load on medical services, and the ultimate societal impact of a disease.

This UK-wide project interviewed about 500 adults with learning disabilities directly (by Zoom, Teams, phone, or other ways of being in contact remotely) and surveyed a further 300 family members or support workers of adults with learning disabilities who could not take part in an interview. The project heard from people at three time points: in the winter of 2020/21 (mainly during lockdown), in the spring of 2021 (when some public health protection measures had been eased), and in late summer 2021 (when most protection measures had been lifted).  The questions asked in the project were guided by policymakers, people with learning disabilities and family members, with some changes in the questions over time depending on changing circumstances. We asked questions about: health, mental health, and wellbeing; new/worsening health problems; contact with health and social care services and professionals; COVID-19 infections, vaccinations and testing; paid jobs and volunteer work; getting online; contact with friends and family; bereavement. In the online surveys, we also asked family carers and support workers a small number of questions about their own health and wellbeing as carers.  The proposed project will go back to the people, family carers and support workers across the UK who took part in the original project, almost all of whom said they would be happy to be contacted about taking part in a future wave. We will use interviews and online surveys again, using the same approaches that people will be familiar with, to find out how people and families are managing as the UK recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. We will keep some of the central questions the same (for example, health and wellbeing; access to health and social care services) to find out people's experiences over time. As before we will proactively gain the views of policymakers, people with learning disabilities and family members in deciding which questions to keep, which questions to drop, and which new questions to add. We plan to go back to people in late summer/early autumn 2022. In addition to this, we propose two specific new pieces of work in England only: 1) to recruit an additional booster sample of adults with learning disabilities from minority ethnic communities (100 interviews and 50 surveys); 2) to carry out in-depth qualitative case study research concerning up to 20 people with learning disabilities about their journeys through the pandemic.

P22413,A functional and comparative approach for the study of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The global range of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti continues to expand due to a changing climate and  increasing urbanization. As Ae. aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and  chikungunya viruses, these range shifts also increase the risk of human disease. With few effective  vaccines or antiviral drugs, vector control remains the best weapon against mosquitoes. Recently, the  release of an insect endosymbiont, Wolbachia, into mosquito populations has emerged as a novel  biocontrol strategy. Maternally inherited and with inbuilt genetic drive, Wolbachia tends to spread  through insect populations. Inside the mosquito, the bacterium limits the replication of viruses, a trait  called Ã¢Â€Â˜viral blockingÃ¢Â€Â™. Following release of Wolbachia into wild populations, the viral blocking effect is  leading to substantial reductions in the incidence of dengue fever in humans. One concern for the long-  term efficacy of Wolbachia is the emergence of resistance in mosquitoes or viruses. To design  strategies to counter this likely scenario, we need to understand the genetic basis of viral blocking.  While many theories have been proposed, none have been entirely satisfying. Recently, the McGraw  lab used a selection experiment to create Ae. aegypti lines carrying Wolbachia with differences in  blocking. In sequencing those lines, her group identified a set of novel candidate loci and a new set of  hypotheses for the basis of blocking. This study also demonstrated that the strength of blocking is likely  to vary across diverse mosquito genetic backgrounds. Here we propose to provide functional testing  for the candidate blocking genes involved with cell adhesion, transcriptional pausing and neuronal  function, for both dengue and chikungunya viruses using RNA silencing. In these experiments we will  also contrast Aedes albopictus, that has long harbored a natural infection of Wolbachia, against Ae.  aegypti with a recently artificially introduced Wolbachia. The nature of blocking in Ae. albopictus is a  likely harbinger of the future of blocking in the artificially infected species. We will also carry out large  common garden experiments to dissect the relative contribution of regional differences in mosquito and  virus diversity to the strength of blocking. This project will produce novel resources for the community  including a new Wolbachia infected Ae. aegypti line, a set of antibodies against key blocking association  proteins and data on the efficacy of improved fluorescent reporter viruses for the study of vector  competence. More broadly, this research will help to test a revised model for Wolbachia-mediated viral  blocking Ã¢Â€Â"" knowledge fundamental for designing strategies to prolong WolbachiaÃ¢Â€Â™s efficacy in the field.  It will also reveal the robustness of blocking to mosquito and viral genetic diversity, that will inform  strategies for future Wolbachia strain deployment globally.",2,2c
C17769,Absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their human targets for informing drug strategies and accelerating vaccine development,"Understanding how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is infectious and causes disease requires a deep understanding of how the infectious particle-the virus- assembles from its component parts, and can make copies of itself and then invade cells and humans. We plan to work out how its  building blocks-its proteins in particular-are produced, in what form and how much of each is made. To do so, we will use a method that weighs  a protein, and counts how many proteins are  in a sample from cells infected with the virus. These numbers will inform strategies for vaccine development as well as offer a deeper understanding of how the virus forms. We will use a method called Multiple-Reaction-Monitoring Mass Spectrometry  (MRM-MS) with protein standards which we will manufacture in our laboratory. This methodology allows to directly measure absolute protein concentrations in complex biological samples. Our approach has great scope for upscaling, because any drug and vaccine development could adopt and benefit from our methodology. We propose to produce bespoke labelled synthetic protein standards and measure the absolute SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including some post-translational modifications, of (i) the virion (likely 9 proteins); (ii) within infected human cell lines (about viral 29 proteins), (iii) including yet undetected proteins; (iv) alongside key human proteins (19 proteins) the virus interacts with and or are considered drug targets; (v) determine the antigen-antibody ratios following vaccination trials in mice and humans and (vi) provide said standards to other laboratories to enable them to conduct similar analytics.",1,"1b, 1c"

C06185,Protecting older people living in care homes from COVID-19: challenges and solutions to implementing social distancing and isolation.,"Research for Social Care Programme Care homes (CHs) provide care for some of the vulnerable population of older people. They are at high risk of poor health outcomes and mortality if they contract COVID-19. The risk of contracting COVID-19 is compounded by difficulties in implementing infection control measures such as social distancing and isolation of residents. It is critical that CH services remain safe and provide high quality care during the pandemic and for further surges. Our research will provide a unique contribution to helping protect older people living in CHs from COVID-19.     Research aim: to explore and understand the real-life experiences of social distancing and isolation in CHs for older people from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, and to develop a toolkit of evidence-informed guidance and resources to support health and care delivery now and for further outbreaks.     Design: This tripartite 12-month study involves a rapid evidence review, in-depth case studies, and toolkit development. Methods:   Phase 1: A rapid review of evidence to collate knowledge on the mechanisms and measures used by CHs and long-term facilities previously to socially distance and isolate older people or control the spread of other infectious and contagious diseases. Phase 2:   a) In-depth case studies of 6 purposively selected CHs to identify the real-life challenges and consequences of providing safe care incorporating social distancing and isolation measures and to identify novel solutions being used to implement these measures in a person-centred way. Data collection: Within each CH case study: Interviews with a purposive sample of 3 residents and 3 family/friends to examine their experiences while residents are social distancing and isolating. Interviews with a purposive sample of 5 staff to examine how they adapt and manage care delivery for residents with different needs whilst maintaining social distancing and isolation of residents. Interview with the CH manager/deputy to examine how they develop, manage, and adapt policies, procedures, and protocols to achieve these measures. Collection of relevant documents and routinely recorded CH data to understand contextual factors.   2b) A focus group with a purposive sample of 8 external key informants with macro-level knowledge and experience relevant to the pandemic for the CH sector. Data analysis: Interviews will be transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Documentary data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Concurrent data collection and analysis will inform decisions about the need for further data collection. Analysis for each case site and across case sites will be conducted. Descriptive summary statistics will be used to describe quantitative data.   Phase 3: Synthesis of findings from Phases 1 and 2 will culminate in a co-produced toolkit comprising evidence-informed guidance and resources. The content of the toolkit will be presented in different ways e.g. using flow charts to present evidence-informed guidance, and film to help narrate the stories of older people, their families/friends and CH staff. We will work with CH practitioners, our CH co-applicants, our PPI group, and Project monitoring and advisory group to co-produce a final version that is meaningful, accessible and will be used in practice.

P22072,Leveraging Zika virus and the immune system to treat glioblastoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain tumor that causes neurological deterioration and death in most patients within 2  years. Despite aggressive therapy, most GBMs reappear within 6 months. A major reason for this outcome is  because GBM stem cells (GSCs) are resistant to existing therapies. Currently, no treatment consistently kills  these highly resistant cells. However, the Zika virus epidemic has provided us with a new approach to eradicate  GSCs. ZIKV targets normal stem cells in the developing fetal brain, yet has minimal effects on differentiated  neurons or the adult brain. Since GSCs share properties with neural stem cells, we investigated whether the  natural honing and lytic activity of ZIKV could be harnessed to target and kill GSCs. We published the first use  of ZIKV to kill GSCs. We showed that ZIKV kills GSCs in tumors removed from patients, with minimal impact on  non-GSC tumor cells, called differentiated GBM cells. Importantly, normal human brain cells were not affected  by ZIKV. After intracranial treatment with ZIKV, mice harboring gliomas survived more than twice as long as  untreated mice and, in some cases, treated mice were long-term survivors. In addition to the resistance of GBM  stem cell to chemoradiation, GBM is the hallmark example of an immunotherapy-resistant tumor. Importantly,  we found that in vivo, ZIKV treatment reduces tumor size and extends survival beyond that expected for only  anti-GSC effects. This suggested that ZIKV killing of GSCs may trigger an immune response against the  remainder of the tumor. In more recent studies, we have found that CD8+ T cells are required for the efficacy of  ZIKV as an oncolytic therapy in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that ZIKV elicits an anti-tumor immune response  that could be made even more effective by combining it with existing immunotherapies. Aim 1 will determine how  CD8+ T cells promote tumor clearance after ZIKV and Aim 2 will determine whether ZIKV can be combined with  immunotherapy or standard-of-care for GBM to improve outcomes. Our long-term goal is to develop a new  treatment for GBM by leveraging the immune system response to ZIKV.",13,
P21945,"Genetic, structural and functional profiling of the human antibody response to arenavirus infection","PROJECT SUMMARY  Arenaviruses are a family of zoonotic RNA viruses that are capable of causing severe hemorrhagic fever disease  in humans. Lassa virus (LASV), an Old World arenavirus which is endemic in regions of West Africa including  Sierra Leone and is the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), causes thousands of deaths annually. Arenaviruses  have repeatedly crossed over into humans over the past several decades, and emerging variants of known  arenaviruses often display increased human-to-human transmissibility and broader geographic range. For these  reasons, the CDC and WHO have classified several human arenaviruses as high priority pathogens and the  PREDICT consortium ranked LASV as the highest risk virus on their watchlist of potential pandemic pathogens.  Vaccines and therapeutics against arenaviruses are urgently needed, however, we must first gain a much deeper  understanding of the molecular mechanisms that result in protective humoral immunity. Although the discovery  of effective clinical countermeasures is the ultimate goal, this collaborative project focuses on leveraging  innovative, high-throughput antibody discovery and characterization tools to define the genetic, functional and  structural properties of anti-LASV antibodies with broad specificity across human arenaviruses. We have  assembled a collaborative, multidisciplinary group of investigators with a long history of productive collaboration  in viral immunology and with complementary areas of expertise. Additionally, we have access to a singular cohort  of LF survivors at Kenema Government Hospital, which is located in Sierra Leone and is at the heart of the LF  zone. We expect our work will result in the discovery of thousands of novel anti-LASV antibodies, characterization  of which will reveal conserved sites of viral vulnerability and uncover the precise molecular mechanisms of viral  neutralization. These fundamental studies directly address critical gaps in our understanding of the interplay  between humoral immunity and hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses and will serve as a foundation for future  translational studies.

Gemini offers a unique opportunity because in the five months prior to U.K. 'lockdown', the study collected detailed information on the food, physical activity and media environments within the home, along with measures of health behaviours and psychological wellbeing. This timely and comprehensive baseline data can be combined with extensive information collected during the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath, enabling rapid characterisation of the impact of the pandemic on the family environment and child health. The immediate insights gained from this study will inform evidence-based guidance for how best to respond to the current pandemic to mitigate negative impacts for families, while simultaneously shaping policies to promote child health and wellbeing should future waves of infection emerge.",10,10a
P23609,Practical strengthening of regulatory and ethics oversight on clinical trials in West Africa using Lassa Fever  vaccine development projects and increase regulatory maturity level in targeted countries,"The proposed strengthening project for clinical research oversight in ECOWAS region, consists of practical training of regulatory and ethics experts by exposing them to Lassa Fever vaccine development from early to late clinical stage. The exposure to novel technologies in vaccine development and the opportunities to responsibly oversee the full clinical development pathway of vaccines for Africa can inspire and attract regulators and ethics experts/talents, and by this contribute to maintaining, enhancing and further developing the workforce at the agencies and ethics institutions. The project intends to enhance the Maturity Level for Regulatory Systems and clinical trial oversight function of 2-4 authorities in the ECOWAS region. Ghana FDA will lead the intended work, with CEPI as project coordinator and WAHO ensuring the dissemination and engagement among ECOWAS countries. The consortium between GFDA, WAHO and CEPI is confident to assure high quality regulatory and ethics oversight during Lassa Fever vaccine development and to create preparedness of ECOWAS NRAs not only for Lassa vaccine future licensure but also for decisions related to emergency use in case of a major Lassa Fever outbreak.     Using the AVAREF platform for scientific advice and CTA simulations and including ECOWAS observer countries in real live clinical trial application assessments will strengthen the common advice and review processes and lead to reliably generate fast decisions by NRAs and ECs in a seamlessly coordinated way. When processes from application to decision are reliable and fast, developers will prefer using AVAREF platform even for single country clinical trial applications. This will open further possibilities for coordinated involvement of observer countries for training purposes. Seamlessly coordinated collaboration on the basis of harmonized and well-defined processes between NRAs, NECs and AVAREF will promote clinical research in Africa and help the AMA operationalization.",13,
P22243,Longitudinal Characterization of Postnatal Brain Maturation after Fetal Zika Infection,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The Brazilian Zika virus outbreak of 2016 initiated an international public health crisis when it became clear that  babies infected in utero were being born with devastating neurological defects. In addition, troubling reports have  shown that many infected babies present as Ã¢Â€Âœneurologically-normalÃ¢Â€Â at birth but experience later atypical  developmental and neurosensory alterations into infancy. The long-term developmental consequences of Zika  infection are currently unknown, but mechanisms of its pathobiology have been linked to the preferential injury  of axons and myelin. Disrupted or delayed myelination in early life has been previously associated to significant  and permanent impairments across domains of sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities. To investigate the impact  of fetal Zika infection on postnatal brain development, this study will acquire quantitative magnetic resonance  imaging metrics of myelin and axon maturation in an established nonhuman primate model at 6, 12, 24, and 30  months of age (equivalent up to ~ age 10 in humans). This proposed work, therefore, takes a novel approach by  tracking whole brain changes in tissue microstructure, in vivo, in an accelerated model of brain development and  links those changes to cellular anatomy, post mortem. Behavioral outcomes related to axon and myelin injury  will also be investigated. The aims of this proposal have been designed for direct translation to human studies  and will establish a valuable resource for predicting and interpreting outcomes of fetal Zika infection.",4,"4b, 4d"

C19746,"Loneliness Among Older Adults in COVID-19: A Living Systematic Review of Changes in Loneliness from Pre-COVID-19, Association with Mental Health Outcomes, and Effects of Interventions","There will be serious loneliness and mental health implications from COVID-19 that extend beyond the pandemic for many people, especially older adults. Addressing these needs requires understanding their nature and extent and evidence on effectiveness of interventions that may be rapidly employed to prevent or address loneliness and mental health concerns. Studies from COVID-19 are published rapidly, but many are of dubious quality. Thus, curation of this growing evidence base is urgently needed to provide practitioners and policy makers with clear, coherent evidence synthesis. Living systematic reviews are systematic reviews that are continually updated and provide ongoing access to results via online publication. They are logistically challenging, but provide value beyond conventional systematic reviews in situations where (1) important decisions need to be made; (2) uncertainty in existing evidence poses a barrier to decision-making; and (3) new evidence is emerging rapidly. Such a review is urgently needed to guide mental health care during and following COVID-19.  Our research team has expertise in high-impact evidence synthesis research (). Our protocol has been made public on the Open Science Framework (). We have already sorted through over 190,000 citations from 10 databases, including two Chinese-language databases, reviewed over 69,000 unique citations, and identified over 260 eligible studies, including studies on older adults. We have published initial evidence online from general populations (). We are working closely with Canadian government personnel to inform mental health strategy for older adults. Important evidence will be published in the months to come. It is crucial to maintain funding for this important project to incorporate the higher quality evidence that is beginning to be made available.",10,10a
P22158,Clearance of Blood-Borne Arboviruses,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Arboviruses cause serious human disease. Viremia level following arbovirus infection of vertebrates is a critical  determinant of viral transmission cycles, global viral spread, and disease severity in individuals. Surprisingly, the  factors that dictate viremia following arbovirus infection are poorly defined. We found that multiple arboviruses,  including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River (RRV), oÃ¢Â€Â™nyong nyong (ONNV) and Zika viruses, are cleared from  the circulation by phagocytic cells. Experiments in splenectomized mice showed that the spleen is dispensable  for arboviral clearance. Instead, virus accumulates in the liver and clearance is independent of natural antibodies  and complement factors, suggesting a non-opsonic mechanism. Consistent with this idea, clearance of  circulating alphaviruses was blocked by competitive inhibitors of scavenger receptors (SRs) that mediate non-  opsonic uptake of non-self and modified-self ligands. Remarkably, we found that single lysine (K) to arginine (R)  mutations in the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and ONNV (E2 K200R), as well as RRV (E2 K251R), abrogated  clearance of circulating alphavirus particles by phagocytic cells, and promoted rapid viral dissemination to distal  tissues. Moreover, substitution of CHIKV E2 K200 with a variety of other amino acids also allows for clearance  evasion, suggesting a specific interaction between key K residues and a host factor. Ks are targets for post-  translational modification (PTM), and mass spectrometry analysis of E2 in virions revealed that CHIKV E2 K200  is ubiquitinated. These experiments have revealed a previously unrecognized pathway that controls arbovirus  viremia and dissemination in vertebrates. We hypothesize that PTM of key Ks in viral glycoproteins licenses the  capture of circulating arboviruses via SRs expressed on liver Kupffer cells (KCs). In Specific Aim 1, the cell  types that capture circulating arboviruses will be defined. We also will determine the role of KCs in viral clearance  and dissemination, and the development of anti-viral immunity. Finally, we will evaluate the role of phagocytic  cells, and KCs specifically, in the clearance of a genera-spanning panel of arboviruses. In Specific Aim 2, we  will define the spectrum of blood-borne arboviruses susceptible to SR-mediated clearance. We will use ELISA  and cellular binding assays to determine the murine and human SR(s) that bind virus particles. Using SR  knockout mice, we will determine the role of specific SRs in clearance of circulating arboviruses. In Specific Aim  3, we will define the role of E2 ubiquitination in the clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV. We will use mass  spectrometry-based proteomics to determine K residues in arboviral particles that are modified with ubiquitin or  other PTMs. Finally, we will use a collection of reverse genetics systems to define the role of specific modified  Ks in arboviral clearance from the circulation. This work will provide new mechanistic understanding of arbovirus  clearance from the circulation. Elucidating these mechanisms could provide new insight into viral transmission,  dissemination, and pathogenesis, identify new risk factors of severe disease, and reveal new therapeutic targets  for the treatment of arboviral disease.",1,1d

P22102,Development of Inhibitors Targeting Flavivirus Methyltransferase,"Abstract:  Flaviviruses are primarily insect-borne, associated with global morbidity and mortality, and found on every  inhabited continent. Unfortunately, current therapeutic options for treating diseases associated with these viruses  are limited. All flaviviruses encode methyltransferases (MTases)Ã¢Â€Â""flaviviral NS5 for both N-7 and 2'-O  methylations of viral genomic RNA. The N-7 MTase function is essential for replication of the viral RNA genome,  whereas 2'-O MTase function is required for the virus to evade the host innate immune response. These activities  are conserved among the flaviviruses. For this project, our collaborative team will optimize the current lead  compounds, perform high throughput screening (HTS) to identify additional lead candidates, chemically optimize  the lead candidates, and define structure activity relationships. Optimizing current lead compounds using cutting-  edge medicinal chemistry, the team will perform a large scale HTS campaign using innovative fluorescence  chemical probes to identify additional small molecule inhibitors of flavivirus RNA capping MTases. We will  perform an in-depth investigation of the model of action and antiviral efficacy using in vitro biochemistry, structural  biology, virology, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and in vivo animal models, which will allow the development of novel,  effective, broad-spectrum, and druglike therapeutic agents against both flaviviruses. Preliminary progress has  been made in the identification of initial lead inhibitors of these MTases, demonstrating low nanomolar antiviral  activity. We will advance these compounds to further develop potent antiviral compounds while conducting large-  scale screening in parallel for additional structural scaffold discoveries. Complementary expertise among our  investigators will synergize and expedite the progress of this research. Our collaborative objective is to provide  first-in-class drug candidates for the treatment or prevention of these viral infections.",7,7a

P21975,Understanding Risk of Zoonotic Virus Emergence in EID Hotspots of Southeast Asia,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Southeast Asia is one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s highest-risk EID hotspots, the origin of the SARS pandemic, Nipah virus,  and repeated outbreaks of influenza. This is driven by high diversity of wildlife and rapidly expanding  demography that brings human and wildlife populations closer. This proposal will launch the Emerging  Infectious Diseases - South East Asia Research Collaboration Hub (EID-SEARCH), a collaboration among  leaders in emerging disease research in the USA, Thailand, Singapore and the 3 major Malaysian  administrative regions. These researchers have networks that span >50 clinics, laboratories and research  institutions across almost all SE Asian countries and will use the EID-SEARCH as an early warning system for  outbreaks involving exchange of information, reagents, samples and technology, and a collaborative power-  house for fundamental and translational research. The EID-SEARCH will also act as a significant asset to  scale-up and deploy resources in the case of an outbreak in the region. This EIDRC will conduct research  to: 1) Identify, characterize and rank spillover risk of high zoonotic potential viruses from wildlife, by analyzing  previously-archived wildlife samples, conducting targeted wildlife surveillance, and using serology & PCR  assays to identify novel viruses. These will be characterized to assess risk of spillover to people, and a series  of in vitro (receptor binding, cell culture) and in vivo (humanized mouse and collaborative cross models) assays  used to assess their potential to infect people and cause disease; 2) Collect samples and questionnaire data  from human communities that live in EID hotspots and have high cultural and behavioral risk of animal  exposure (e.g. wildlife hunting, bat guano collection). These will be tested with serological assays to identify  evidence of novel virus spillover, and analyzed against metadata to identify key risk pathways for transmission;  3) Identify and characterize viral etiology of Ã¢Â€Â˜crypticÃ¢Â€Â™ outbreaks in clinical cohorts. We will conduct syndromic  surveillance at clinics serving the populations in Aim 2, enroll patients with undiagnosed illness and symptoms  consistent with emerging viral pathogens, and test samples with molecular and follow-up serological assays to  identify causal links between these syndromes and novel viruses.  This research will advance our understanding of the risk of novel viral emergence in a uniquely important  region. It will also strengthen in-country research capacity by linking local infectious disease scientists  with an international collaborative network that has proven capacity to conduct this work and produce  significant findings. The large body of high impact collaborative research from this EIDRC leadership team  provides proof-of-concept that EID-SEARCH has the background, collaborative network, experience, and  skillset to act as a unique early warning system for novel EIDs of any etiology threatening to emerge in  this hottest of the EID hotspots.","2, 3","2a, 3d"

P22661,Triggering germline-encoded broadly neutralizing antibody responses against influenza virus,"Project Summary / Abstract  This is an application by Dr. Daniel Lingwood and Dr. Facundo Batista, faculty members of the Ragon Institute  of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Both investigators define B cell-antigen recognition principles to inform antibody  vaccine design, and for this, have developed two orthogonal transgenic mouse models that recapitulate human  antibody responses in vivo. The investigators propose to apply these models to evaluate germline stimulation  of human B cell lineages known to give rise to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAbs) against influenza A  viruses (IAV), which account for the majority of flu-hospitalizations and pandemic threats. Most antibody  responses to IAV are dominated by off-target, non-neutralizing activities, however, work from the investigators  indicates that human BCRs assembled from the antibody VH gene, IGHV1-69, possess natural specificity for a  conserved site of vulnerability, the stem-bnAb epitope on the hemagglutinin spike proteins from Group 1 IAV  (IAV subtypes: H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H12, H16). To test if this genetically endows for vaccine-  amplifiable bnAb development pathways, the investigators have engineered the LINGWOOD mouse system,  where antibodies develop with human antibody VH genes (e.g. IGHV1-69) and full human CDRH3 diversity.  Genetic manipulation of this system enables in vivo B cell titration to match the IGHV1-69 B cell frequency  found in humans. Sequentially immunizing these mice with SS-np, a nanoparticle displaying the bnAb target,  has succeeded in germline stimulation of IGVH1-69 bnAb precursors and IGHV1-69-dependent expansion of  bnAb responses; the first example of eliciting high titer IAV bnAbs through vaccination. This response also  provided broad protection against Group 1 IAV, including pandemic bird flu, supporting the investigators'  central hypothesis that broadly protective bnAbs can be elicited by germline antibody-targeting vaccines. In  Aim 1, the investigators will define whether SS-np stands as a universal booster of the IGHV1-69-encoded  bnAb response after introduction of B cell memory to diverse IAV `swarms' that simulate human immune  history to influenza. In Aim 2, the investigators will define how refocusing serum antibodies against this specific  bnAb target also enhances antibody Fc effector functions, potentially co-enabling protection through activation  of innate immunity. In Aim 3, the BATISTA mouse system will be used to evaluate vaccine-expansion of  IGHV1-69 bnAbs alongside the human IGHV1-18- and IGHV6-1-class bnAb lineages, which neutralize the  remaining Group 2 IAV subtypes (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15). In this system, murine IgM B cells bearing  individual human bnAb precursors of each pathway are co-transferred to a single recipient mouse. Following  immunization, lineage expansions are individually tracked via their progression through B cell germinal centers  and then into immune memory. The animals will be co-immunized with SS-np, SS-np2, and SS-np3; three  geometrically identical nanoparticles bearing distinct affinities for each bnAb precursor. Selective + collective  expansion of these bnAb lineages aims to overcome failure of traditional influenza vaccine approaches.","1, 7","1d, 7i"
C15298,Mechanisms for post-COVID pituitary damage,"PROJECT SUMMARY  COVID-19-related extra-pulmonary damage is common and may even be observed in patients with mild COVID-  19 symptoms. There is an urgent and immediate need to establish optimal post-infection health care strategies  for these patients, yet mechanisms underlying their appearance remain unexamined. For example, post-COVID-  19 chronic fatigue syndrome has been reported in 54% of COVID-19 survivors, including those without severe  symptoms during the acute infection; however, its cause has not been addressed. Post-COVID-19 chronic  fatigue syndrome's symptoms mimic those experienced by patients with well-described pituitary hormone  deficiencies, supporting the concept that pituitary dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 may be implicated in  post-COVID-19 health complications. Several lines of evidence support the premise that SARS-CoV-2 infection  damages the pituitary, leading to disrupted pituitary function. First, we detected expression of the SARS-CoV-2  receptor ACE2 in the normal human pituitary by immunofluorescence, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may directly  damage pituitary endocrine cells. Second, it has been reported that the SARS pandemic in Southeast Asia in  2002, by SARS-CoV-1, caused post-infection pituitary function decline, although direct damage to the pituitary  was not investigated. Third, clinical observations suggest that patients with COVID-19 show aberrant immune  activity and may develop cytokine storm, with particularly acute elevations of IL-6 and TNFα. Cytokine storm,  which can occur as a consequence of with cancer immunotherapy treatment, for example, is frequently  associated with pituitary inflammation and dysfunction, although the detailed pathogenetic mechanisms are not  known. This suggests that aberrant activation of the immune system may also indirectly damage the pituitary in  patients with COVID-19. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying direct and indirect pituitary damage related to  SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to establishing guidelines for timely diagnosis and management of pituitary  dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. In Aim 1, we will determine whether SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the  pituitary and causes pituitary structural damage. We will study autopsy-derived pituitary tissues obtained from  COVID-19 deceased patients and normal control pituitary tissues. Moreover, using a novel spatial genomics  technology, we will determine changes in gene expression associated with COVID-19 in each of the five pituitary  endocrine lineages and stroma cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the association and the timeline of pituitary  dysfunction and symptoms in patients who were infected by SARS-CoV-2. By combining detailed and innovative  cellular and molecular analyses, and clinical studies, we will identify the mechanisms responsible for pituitary  dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and determine the course of pituitary dysfunction in COVID-19. These  innovative studies will, in turn, enable the development of an evidence-based clinical guide for evaluation and  management of hormone deficiencies in the vast COVID-19 population across the globe.",4,"4a, 4b"
C09585,Howard University Research Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities,"PROJECT ABSTRACTCenters for Disease Control data continue to show that, in unadjusted analyses, Non-Hispanic Blacks, IndigenousAmericans and Hispanic and Latino persons have higher COVID-19 case rates, hospitalizations, and deaths compared toNon-Hispanic Whites. The observed differences in morbidity and mortality do not appear to be adequately explained bypre-existing risk factors. It is becoming widely accepted that COVID-19 disparities are, in large part, a direct result ofstructural violence; defined as the built in differences in distribution of resources, education and literacy, medical care,social and economic opportunities, and, importantly, power to decide. In keeping with recommendations that pandemicresponse planning and readiness should include addressing social injustice, the proposed study seeks to lay a foundationfor a long-term response to the social determinants of health disparities that have been laid bare by COVID-19. Thepopulation of interest for this study are African Americans in the DC metropolitan area with an emphasis on communitiesthat experience social, economic, and health vulnerabilities. To achieve our aims, we have convened a broad-based groupof diverse scholars, health professionals, and community stakeholders. This group will collaboratively create and curatean information repository that will be used to create strategies to guide interventions to address the current crisis, with alens toward long-term change. We will test two specific interventions; both designed to increase research literacy andpromote community capacity for informed decision making about COVID-19 response behaviors including participationin testing, clinical research, and vaccination. We hypothesize that messages that emphasize informed choice will promotemore favorable attitudes toward COVID-19 research and vaccination. The first intervention approach will conveneopportunities for researchers and community members to have frank dialogues about the quality and relevance ofemerging science and the unique ethical challenges presented by the pandemic. The second intervention will applyevidence-based community health work interventions to address community information needs about COVID-19. Thesecommunity health interventions will also be responsive to everyday health and social priorities that might take precedenceover considerations of adhering to recommendations for COVID-19 response. We anticipate that these activities willpromote trust in using research information to make informed decision because the trust is not in the expert knowledge,but in the individual's ability to weigh the evidence and draw conclusions. We anticipate that this project will result inimportant outcomes including: 1) replicable approaches for enhancing existing networks for engaging communities intesting, follow-up care and social services to address basic needs related to COVID-19; 2) creation of a trusted COVID-19communication network to reach underserved and/or vulnerable populations and 3) evidence-based materials andapproaches to address current misrepresentations or misunderstandings inhibiting uptake of COVID-19 testing andvaccination.",9,"9a, 9b, 9c"
P22808,Mimicking evolution to define mechanisms of airborne transmission of H7N9 viruses,"The Asian lineage H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIV) have caused >1500 human zoonotic infections with 615 deaths. These viruses have not spread in humans; however, there is a high potential for these viruses to evolve to transmit via the airborne route and cause a pandemic. Using ferrets, we previously evaluated the ability of the prototypic Asian lineage virus, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), to undergo two continuous rounds of airborne transmission. In these studies, we found that the virus was able to transmit to 50-66% of respiratory contact ferrets during both rounds of transmission. In a subsequent deep sequence analysis, we identified 2-5 mutations in 90-99% of all variant viruses that transmitted. These mutations were in the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and viral polymerase genes. As airborne transmission is associated with enhanced binding and replication in cells of the upper airways, we hypothesize that the identified mutations will alter the molecular properties of the virus to enhance replication in primary human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells. Our aims are:  Aim 1. Determine the role of previously identified HA and NA mutations in an H7N9 virus with the A/PR/8 vaccine backbone. Viruses carrying the H7N9 HA and NA on the A/PR8 vaccine backbone will generated.  Mutations will be introduced into the HA and NA gene segments and several properties including receptor-binding preference, pH of fusion, thermostability, NA activity, and changes in antibody recognition via immune serum will be evaluated.  Aim 2. Evaluate the role of previously identified mutations on the viral polymerase.  To assess the impact of mutations in the viral polymerase, in vitro polymerase reconstitution assays will be performed. Specifically, the activity of the wild-type H7N9 polymerase with and without the identified mutations will be assessed. Aim 3. Determine if the introduction of previously identified mutations alters viral replication in primary human airway epithelial cells.  To determine if the identified mutations impact viral replication, we will evaluate the replication kinetics of recombinant H7N9-A/PR8 viruses for their growth in primary human airway epithelial cells. Primary human cells will include nasal, tracheal, bronchial, and small airway epithelial cells. Collectively, these studies will determine the effect of the identified mutations on different molecular properties of the virus, while also determining if the mutations alter the viral tropism in human cells.  Our findings will generate new insight on how AIV evolve to transmit via the airborne route and will yield critical knowledge required to interpret the evolution and assess the pandemic potential of H7N9 viruses.","1, 4","1c, 4b"

P22653,Automated chemo-enzymatic synthesis of N-glycans for host-pathogen interactions,"SUMMARY  Numerous viruses initiate infection by binding to cell surface glycans of the host. The selectivities of viral  receptor binding proteins for specific glycans critically determine host range, tissue- and cell tropism  and pathogenesis. A detailed understanding of receptor usage by respiratory viruses is critical for the  development of surveillance, prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate risks of future pandemic  outbreaks. Glycan receptor usage by respiratory viruses have been difficult to probe because of a lack  of appropriate panels of glycans for structure-activity studies. The latter is due to limitations in synthetic  methodologies that do not permit the preparation of large panels of biological relevant glycans.  In this program, chemoenzymatic methodologies will be developed that make it possible to prepare a  wide range of N-glycan found in the respiratory tract of human and relevant animals. It is based on a  new synthetic paradigm, which we coined Ã¢Â€ÂœStop-and-Go-Chemoenzymatic GlycosylationÃ¢Â€Â. It uses  chemically modified sugar nucleotide donors that can be employed by relevant glycosyl transferases to  give products in which particular residues are temporarily blocked from further enzymatic modification.  At an appropriate stage of synthesis, the blocking group can be removed to give a natural glycan. The  speed of glycan synthesis will be increased by developing an automation platform that can perform  enzymatic and chemical manipulations. The new methodologies will be used to prepare a collection of  complex N-glycans that resemble structures expressed by respiratory tissue for host-pathogen studies.  In this application, the collection of glycans will used to examine in detail receptor usage of influenza A  viruses. The glycans will be printed as a microarray to probe binding specificities of human and animal  influenza A viruses. Selected compounds will be examined in dynamic binding assays to establish the  interplay between hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) activity. The proposed studies will  uncover unique traits of human and animal IAVs, which will facilitate the implementation of surveillance,  prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate risks of future pandemics. The result of the studies will  be exploited to develop an array-based system to antigenically characterize IAVs, which will greatly  facilitate strain selection for seasonal flu vaccination.  1","1, 4","1b, 4b"

Molecular information obtained for specific families of viruses can subsequently be used to develop drugs that very specifically inhibit essential virus structures and functions without disrupting normal cellular functions, which obviously would cause toxic side effects during antiviral therapy.    The proposed research investigates molecular details of the life cycle of coronaviruses, which are large RNA viruses causing respiratory and enteric disease in livestock, companion animals and humans. More specifically, the study focuses on the structures and functions of a multi-protein complex that is comprised of 16 viral and several cellular proteins and includes enzymes, called polymerases, that multiply the viral genome RNA, which is one of the essential steps in the production of new viruses.    The focus of this research is to investigate the properties and functions of two coronavirus polymerases and their interactions with other proteins in the multi-protein complex. Using a range of molecular, biochemical and genetic methods, the work will produce valuable new insight into the molecular and mechanistic details involved in coronavirus replication. This will have broad applications to developing new strategies for antiviral therapy of infections caused by coronaviruses and similar viruses and help improve our understanding of cellular processes including those related to antiviral host responses.",1,1b
C07404,TraCK Transmission of COVID19 in Kids,"COVID-19 can infect children without causing symptoms, meaning that spread of COVID-19 among children has been almost impossible to study.  Other infections in the throat like scarlet fever spread rapidly between children, and spread from children to other household members. In contrast, it is thought that children are not major spreaders of COVID-19.  Nonetheless, there is evidence that children are just as likely to have been infected with COVID-19 as adults in some communities. If COVID-19 can be spread by children at a level similar to scarlet fever, we may be missing a vital link in preventing wider community spread of COVID-19. Our study will investigate how quickly and efficiently the virus might be spread by schoolchildren, and will include teachers and household contacts. We will investigate how long children can carry 'infectious' virus, and if the virus is present in saliva or the surrounding air. Conversely, if we find that children do not readily transmit the virus at all, our study will be able to provide a high level of reassurance to teachers, parents, and the public. The findings should provide much needed information for modelling and public health guidance.",3,"3a, 3b"

P21653,Live-attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccines:  comparative mechanisms of trans-placental transmission and vaccine efficacy for developing fetuses,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The World Health Organization warns of a pending public health emergency caused by mosquito-borne  zoonotic pathogen Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The consequences of this emerging virus could be  exacerbated by insufficient vaccines for prevention of infection and disease. RVF is an important  agroeconomic illness of domesticated livestock and is endemic in Africa and parts of the Middle East. Further  spread is likely given that mosquito species capable of transmitting RVFV are found in Europe and the  Americas. The most striking feature of RVF disease in sheep is a wave of fetal loss (known as an Ã¢Â€Âœabortion  stormÃ¢Â€Â) that sweeps through herds of pregnant animals, where spontaneous abortion rates can reach as high  as 90%. Vaccination of livestock protects animals while simultaneously reducing the spread of RVFV to  people. Obstacles in the successful development of RVFV livestock vaccines include: 1) vaccine strains often  cause fetal infection and death in pregnant animals, and 2) vaccines that protect adult animals from disease  are not always effective at preventing vertical transmission during pregnancy. These hurdles represent a major  gap in the vaccine development field. The mechanisms by which live-attenuated vaccine strains of RVFV are  vertically transmitted in utero, as well as the maternal immune response required for the protection of  developing fetuses, are not known. No systematic evaluation of the vertical transmission potential of clinically-  relevant live attenuated vaccines has been performed. To address this gap in the field, we propose to use an  experimental rodent model of RVFV vertical transmission and fetal death in late-gestation pregnant rats. RVFV  directly infects the placenta in rats, causes hemorrhage and inflammation, and results in fetal malformations  including intrauterine fetal death even in pregnant dams without signs of disease. This proposal will use the  pregnant rat model to test current RVF vaccine candidates for the mechanism(s) of vertical transmission, fetal  protection, and identification of maternal immune correlates of fetal protection. We will also conduct a  comparative analysis of virulent and attenuated RVFV strains for permissivity of placental explants from  relevant species to identify cellular and structural targets of infection. Our overall hypothesis is that infection of  pregnant rats with RVFV live-attenuated vaccines will provide pre-clinical quantitative data on vaccine safety  for developing fetuses, efficacy for the fetuses, and critical maternal correlates of fetal protection. Completion  of these studies will change the paradigm of RVFV vaccine development by providing, for the first time, a  mechanistic explanation for the vertical transmission potential of clinically relevant LAVs.","1, 2","1e, 2a, 2y"
P22956,Role of spatial structure in shaping viral population diversity and evolution,"Summary  Viral evolution enables the emergence of novel viral pathogens in the human population. The evolution of  influenza A virus is also critical for the maintenance of seasonal lineages in the context of host immunity.  Evolution can result from selection, leading to increased fitness, or stochastic processes that typically decrease  fitness. The relative potency of selective and stochastic forces is therefore a critical determinant of the adaptive  potential of a population. Based on evolutionary theory, we hypothesize that the magnitude of stochastic effects  in viral evolution is strongly impacted by the spatial structure that characterizes viral spread within a host. In  other words, the expansion of a virus population in space may give rise to random, within-host bottlenecks and  founder effects that weaken the efficiency of natural selection. Factors that shape viral spread - including viral  phenotypes, host responses and physical characteristics of the host environment - are therefore predicted to  impact viral genetic diversity and evolution. Our overarching hypothesis is that viral features that modulate  viral spatial structure also modulate viral diversity and evolution. We will test this hypothesis for influenza  A virus using a well-integrated combination of simulation modeling and experimental approaches. In Aim 1, we  will use computational, cell culture and ferret models to examine the consequences of spatially structured spread  for genetic diversity of viral populations. For our experiments, we will use viruses carrying a selectively neutral  barcode to allow robust quantification of viral diversity. In this way, the degree to which stochastic effects  dominate viral dynamics will be examined under a range of conditions. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the  consequences of spatially structured spread for both purifying and positive selection. Computational approaches  will be used to develop hypotheses of how long distance virus dispersal impacts the ability of de novo beneficial  and deleterious mutations to reach dominance. These model predictions will then be tested using experimental  evolution under conditions of common vs. rare long distance dispersal. In this way, we will test the theoretical  concept that stochastic effects associated with spatial structure impede the ability of natural selection to act on  expanding populations. Taken together, the research proposed in these two aims will uncover the importance of  spatial structure to viral population biology and evolution, deepening our fundamental understanding of the forces  shaping viral evolution in nature.",1,"1b, 1c"

C00986,Determinants of Coronavirus Fidelity in Replication and Pathogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARYViruses in the Coronaviridae family (CoVs) have emerged as zoonoses with pandemic potential twice in the21st century, causing severe human disease. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV continues tocause new cases of lethal respiratory infections with 35% mortality. Further, severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS)-like bat CoVs currently circulating are capable of infecting human cells, establishing the risk for futureemergence of zoonotic CoVs. There are no approved vaccines or antivirals for any human or zoonotic CoV,emphasizing the importance of identifying vulnerable and broadly conserved CoV targets for therapeuticintervention and vaccine development. Most RNA viruses generate genetic diversity required for interspeciesmovement and adaptation via error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) that lack proofreading.In contrast, all CoVs encode a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that isa key driver of CoV evolution and adaptation via RNA-dependent RNA proofreading. During the four years offunding for this program, we have shown that CoV nsp14-ExoN mediates high-fidelity replication and that CoVslacking ExoN activity (ExoN(-)) are less fit during infection in cell culture, more sensitive to RNA mutagens, andattenuated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection. Our findings suggest that divergent β-CoVs - MERS-CoV,SARS-CoV, and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) - have differential requirements for ExoN to sustain viability andoverall fitness. Finally, ExoN may play important and previously unpredicted functions in CoV resistance tohost innate immune surveillance. Thus, our published and preliminary studies support the scientific premisethat nsp14-ExoN is a master regulator of CoV fitness, evolution, and pathogenesis via functions in viralreplication, fidelity, and evasion of host innate immune responses. Specific aims of this proposal will define: 1)Sequence and structural determinants of nsp14-ExoN-mediated functions in CoV replication, fidelity, andinterferon sensitivity; 2) Adaptations in nsp14, nsp12-RdRp, and elsewhere in the CoV replicase thatcompensate for loss of ExoN-mediated fidelity; and 3) Mechanisms of ExoN regulation of the innate antiviralimmune response in vitro and in vivo. The availability of a high-resolution structure of nsp14; facile reversegenetics systems for MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and robust, relevant animal models for SARS-CoVand MERS-CoV will allow us to address these questions, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of ExoNroles and mechanisms in CoV replication, adaptation, and pathogenesis. These studies will catalyzeapproaches targeting ExoN as a basis for stably attenuated CoV vaccines and novel antiviral drugs.",1,"1b, 1d"

All health regions in Norway are represented in this research initiative to minimise any bias in the material. To address the pathogenicity, we will investigate patients at different time points from inclusion in the cohort according to the ISARIC protocol to assess different outcomes by serial sampling and clinical data collection. We will use rapid syndrome-based point-of-care testing, Whole Genome Sequencing and Next Generation Sequencing to detect co-infections and for detailed studies of virological causes of severe outcome. Such novel sequencing techniques will be employed in collaboration with virologists at Wuhan Institute of Virology, Hubei, China, allowing for comparison with strains from the origin and start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.    The study will generate much needed knowledge on the clinical features of the infection, longterm morbidity and mortality and occurrence of co-infections and will describe the response to treatment, including supportive care and novel therapeutics. We will observe pathogen replication, excretion and evolution, within the host in various biological material. Further, we aim to investigate host immune responses over time during hospitalisation and at follow-up in relation to clinical outcome.  This large study provides an excellent framework for a PhD fellowship focusing on the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, co-infections and the study of virus mutations and dissemination in the patient over time and across cases using novel virological techniques.

C15183,Behavioral and Social Science Research to Optimize SARS-CoV-2 Protective Vaccine Uptake in Racial Minority Communities with High Rates of COVID-19,"ABSTRACT   Intensive efforts are underway to develop a vaccine protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hope  is high that a safe and effective vaccine will soon be available. However, development of a vaccine does not  ensure its uptake on the scale needed to bring COVID-19 under control. In the United States, communities of  color are disproportionately burdened by COVID-19 diagnosis, serious illness, and death. However, experience  in areas such as influenza vaccination portends that COVID-19 vaccine uptake will be lower in African American  communities hard-hit by the disease. Racial disparities in influenza vaccination have been linked to individual  factors (including low vaccine awareness, medical mistrust, fears and vaccine skepticism); structural barriers  (such as not having an accessible primary health care provider); peer group norms that do not sufficiently  support getting vaccinated; and social, economic, and life stressors that contribute to many health inequities.  Similar but also unique factors are likely to undermine acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in racial minority  communities. Community-engaged research must be undertaken now-and at a point before a vaccine is widely  available-to understand and address community concerns and to develop strategies to prevent racial  disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake. The planned research will be undertaken in Milwaukee by a team of  behavioral and social scientists in a collaboration with an established federally qualified community health center  serving low-income inner-city residents. The research will use mixed methods to identify minority community  concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination; to determine factors that influence strength of community members'  intentions to vaccinate; and to pilot test and establish the feasibility and acceptability of a virtually-delivered  intervention that engages community social influencers to address vaccine concerns and endorse vaccine  benefits within their social networks. The work will be undertaken in an accelerated manner in three distinct but  interrelated phases, all with samples diverse in age and gender: (1) focus groups conducted with 160 African  American inner-city community members to elicit COVID-19 vaccine beliefs; perceived risks, benefits, and  norms; and factors that would impede or facilitate vaccination; (2) an online quantitative survey study that will  enroll 700 community members from zip codes with greatest SARS-CoV-2 rates and will measure respondents'  intentions to vaccinate and test the influence on those intentions of theory-based predictors including perceived  COVID-19 threat; perceived vaccination benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy, as well as identifying preferred  settings for vaccination; and (3) a feasibility and acceptability pilot test of a virtually-delivered intervention that  trains and enlists personally-known and trusted neighborhood social influencers to address the COVID-19  vaccination concerns of their friends, family members, neighbors, coworkers, and social media followers, and  that supports informed decisions about vaccination. This research will characterize vaccine concerns and identify  strategies that can optimize vaccine uptake in racial minority communities vulnerable to COVID-19.",9,"9b, 9d"
C04624,Optimising Wellbeing during Self-isolation (OWLS),People with severe mental health problems are at increased risk of being affected by COVID-19 and the pandemic restrictions. This is because they are more likely to live in impoverished circumstances and are less likely to be able to access the internet. Many people with mental health problems have physical health problems also which may mean they are in a group that needs to isolate for long periods of time. In this project we want to look at how people with mental health problems are affected by the current pandemic. We want to know whether people are able to access health services when they need to. Whether they are able to use the internet to access services and contact friends and if they are feeling lonely. Finally have they made any changes to reduce the risk of COVID-19 such as stopping smoking. The project involves completing questionnaires and taking part in interviews. We will invite people who took part in the Health and Wellbeing Survey and said they were interested in taking part in future research. The results of the study will be used to make recommendations about how best to support people with severe mental illness during a pandemic.,10,10a
P25438,saRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trial,"A vaccine is critical to tackling coronavirus. The clinical and scientific communities are increasingly of the view that whilst isolation, social distancing and testing can get the world through the current coronavirus problem, the only long-term solution to beating the disease will be finding a vaccine. To find a successful vaccine will take the collective effort of government, academia, industry and healthcare. We know that traditionally vaccine development can take years and we also know more fail than succeed. To accelerate development, government will have a key role to play in derisking projects, by funding their early stage R&D and clinical trialling, and in corralling industry to make sure we have the manufacturing capacity and effective supply chains to produce vaccines at scale, quickly. This is likely to mean manufacturing at risk, i.e. investing in facilities now and producing millions of doses of vaccines ready for deployment, which may turn out not to work. Government has already taken action to bring together all those working on a vaccine in the UK. A Vaccines Taskforce has been set up reporting to the BEIS and DHSC Secretaries of State, as well as to Sir Patrick Vallance and Jonathan Van Tam. The taskforce is bringing together government, industry, academics, funders, regulators, logistics and finance to make rapid decisions that will accelerate progress on the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and vaccinate the right proportion of the population as soon as possible after a vaccine is available. For the UK to be in a position to vaccinate the right proportion of the population as soon as possible after a vaccine is available, we need to: ? Support discovery, development and scale up in the UK; ? Prepare the UK to offer itself as an expert clinical testing site and possible manufacturing site, proactively approaching companies such as Moderna which are at the forefront of vaccine development; ? Review regulations to facilitate rapid, well supervised trials; ? Develop funding and operational plan for procurement and delivery of vaccines and; ? Build on the UK s R&D expertise to support the international effort. On the first of those priorities, there are 41 leading vaccine candidates in the world, of which the UK is home to two: at Oxford University and at Imperial College. A team at Imperial College London, led by Robin Shattock, have been developing a saRNA vaccine for COVID-19, that aims to cut half a billion off development costs, and years from the traditional cycle, potentially allowing the UK to begin immunisation in late 2020. The outlined plan assumes that vaccine production will be started at risk, based on early positive signs from the Phase 2 clinical trials. This is necessary in order to move into immunising the population ahead of the coming winter.",7,7z
P22662,Single cell heterogeneity of influenza A virus genetic diversity and host adaptation using drop-based microfluidics,"Project Summary  New pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) strains can arise when mutations enable host adaptation. Mutations that  overcome host range restrictions are important in viral emergence and zoonotic infections. Zoonotic spillover  into humans with avian IAV subtypes, such as H5N1 and H7N9, have mortality rates as high as 60%. While  significant progress has identified many mutations that allow IAV to adapt to new host species, we have an  incomplete understanding of the depth of viral mutations generated during viral replication. Defining the  heterogeneity of viral mutations will shed light on the viral genetic diversity that enables zoonotic spillover.  Critically, IAV infection in humans occurs in heterologous cell populations in the respiratory tract that correlate  differently with the likelihood of virus transmission. Single cell analysis of these different cell types with both  human and avian IAV strains will allow us to explore how virus strain and cell type influences viral diversity.  Drop-based microfluidics is a method in which the host cell and virus are compartmentalized within picoliter-  sized drops, creating millions of micro-environments, allowing for high-throughput analysis. Drop-based  microfluidics therefore provides an ideal platform for the study of viral genetic diversity from fast evolving RNA  viruses in the laboratory. Our long-term objective is to understand the evolution of IAV that leads to host  adaptation, virulence, transmission, and ultimately zoonotic spread. To begin to address this long-term  objective we will evaluate single cell IAV genomic heterogeneity by 1.) quantifying the genetic diversity arising  from avian and seasonal human IAV infections of individual human primary cells and 2.) performing  evolutionary studies by serial passaging IAV viruses at a single cell level. These two independent, but  complementary aims are directed at understanding: (Aim 1) how specific cell types impact viral genetic  diversity and zoonotic risk, and (Aim 2) how viral diversity evolves when system and population level  bottlenecks are altered. The proposed research will broadly impact the field of single cell virology by  characterizing the role that viral diversity plays in virus propagation, transmission, and evolution. These studies  will yield fundamental mechanistic insights into virus-host cell dynamics, which may aid in developing  efficacious vaccines and therapeutics that can target rapidly evolving IAV and other RNA viruses.",1,1c
C07035,Structure-based Bioengineering of Wnt Surrogates for Intestinal Stem Cell Biology and Therapy,"Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)has threatened global health. The severity of disease and rising number of deaths from SARS-CoV-2have raised an urgent need for effective therapies. Besides respiratory symptoms, 20-50% of patientsexhibit gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and emesis. In addition, clinical evidence showsthat viral RNA can be found in rectal swabs, indicating that the intestine may be a critical target ofSARS-CoV-2 infection. In this proposal, we engineer novel high-affinity blocking agents for known entryreceptors of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent infection of human intestinal cells and pursue a longer-term goalof structure-based discovery of novel receptor targets. Aim 1 designs blocking agents that target the known interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S protein withits primary entry receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), as well as with a novel co-receptor,CD147 (accessory protein for monocarboxylate transporters), both of which are expressed in humansmall intestinal and colon epithelial cells. In Aim 1 we will engineer an ACE2/CD147 bi-specific agentthat can simultaneously target both SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptors to improve the efficiency andspecificity of viral blockade. We utilize in vitro protein evolution by yeast cell surface display to generatehigh-affinity ACE2 and CD147 ECDs with improved affinity for SARS-CoV-2 S protein versus the wild-type ECDs These will be combined into a single bispecific agent containing both ACE2 and CD147affinity-matured ECDs and assayed in human intestinal organoids. In particular, we deploy intestinalorganoids with a ""flipped polarity"" where the apical ACE2-expressing aspect faces outwards towardsthe surrounding ECM/media instead of towards the interior lumen to better model physiologic viralinfection. In Aim 2, we will screen a CRISPRa activating library for additional human SARS-CoV-2secretome targets. The SARS-CoV-2 secretome, i.e. virus-encoded secreted or surface-exposedtransmembrane proteins, also facilitates infection of host cells and provides novel targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. This proposal leverages expertise of Chris Garcia (Multi-PI of the parental R01)in protein engineering, immunotherapeutics, and structural biology with Calvin Kuo (Multi-PI of theparental R01) expertise in organoid generation and disease modelling to design targeted therapeuticsfor SARS-CoV-2.

C04661,Homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic: homeless migrants in a global crisis,"People experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. This project, involving researchers from University of Portsmouth, University of Sussex and St Mungo's, the homelessness charity, will produce an 18-month qualitative-based study of migrant homelessness during the crisis.  A particular focus of the study will be the experience of non-UK nationals. Government efforts have helped provide emergency accommodation for thousands of homeless people during the crisis, but concerns remain about how homeless migrants with No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) can be supported in the longer-term. Many homeless migrants face multiple everyday challenges; they experience the hostility and aggression directed toward homeless people, compounded with often intense experiences of racism. A cultural miasma of fear and anxiety due to pandemic can affect such vulnerable minority groups particularly forcefully.

In doing so, we will examine the intersection of personal histories, wider social structures and the dynamics of the particular situation. While much of the research on homelessness is nationally specific, we will examine the crisis with a global perspective, one that identifies the complex global processes that underpin homelessness as well as the coronavirus.

P22107,Arbovirus Prediction and Mitigation in the Indo-Pacific,"Project Summary / Abstract  Dengue, a potentially life-threatening disease, has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years. In Indonesia, 1 in 3  children have had a dengue infection by 5 years old. Islands in the Indo-Pacific are highly vulnerable to climate  change and water insecurity, two key drivers of arbovirus spread. Predicting and mitigating arbovirus  transmission in the Indo-Pacific is critical to addressing the increasing risk of arboviruses in the U.S. In the next  several decades, half the U.S. may have habitat suitable for Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, mosquitos  which spread dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses.  Revitalizing Informal Settlements and their Environments (RISE) is a cluster randomized control trial evaluating  the benefits of upgrading local water infrastructure in urban slums in Indonesia and Fiji. The RISE intervention  is a prototype for future slum upgrading to address climate change and water insecurity throughout the Indo-  Pacific. Although the World Health Organization recommends permanent environmental modification as an  arbovirus control strategy, this has never before been rigorously tested. RISE provides an important  opportunity to evaluate whether this model decreases or inadvertently increases arbovirus transmission.  In addition to evaluating a new paradigm for mitigating arbovirus transmission, RISE is an ideal platform to  assess gaps in knowledge about environmental drivers of arbovirus transmission. My hypothesis is that  modifiable environmental conditions drive arbovirus transmission in these communities. To test this hypothesis,  I will leverage the RISE platform to study arbovirus risk factors in this region and evaluate the impact of  permanent environmental modification on arbovirus transmission in urban slums. I will also create a  mathematical model to simulate arbovirus transmission in this region under a range of climate change and  intervention scenarios.  I have developed a customized career development plan that aligns with my proposed research. It incorporates  both formal and informal training under the mentorship of Drs. LaBeaud and Luby. This training plan draws  upon my existing expertise in global health, tropical medicine, and epidemiology; it will enhance my expertise  in laboratory diagnostics, geospatial analysis, and mathematical modeling.

There  are several investigational drugs that have been used to treat cases of orthopoxvirus infection and one has been  recently approved by the FDA for limited use, but viral resistance to this compound has been noted. The WHO,  CDC and other agencies have stated a strong desire for at least two small molecule therapeutics that broadly  target poxviruses due to the high perceived risk of poxviral disease both from endemic exposure as well as the  potential purposeful release of smallpox as a bioterror agent. This goal has not yet been met.  We have identified a family of non-nucleoside small molecules (Ã¢Â€ÂœPDPMsÃ¢Â€Â) that show broad spectrum antipoxviral  activity and low/no toxicity to cells and suppress viral mRNA production. Our current data suggests is that the  drug is targeting the poxvirus RNA polymerase (RNAP), which would be an ideal target that is highly conserved  across all poxviruses.  Through this proposal we will probe the potential of PDPMs to become effective antivirals, using medicinal  chemistry approaches to identify compounds with high potency and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. To aid  and complement the therapeutic development of these molecules, we will use genetic, biochemical and chemical  approaches to determine the target of the compound and the mechanism by which it blocks viral replication.  Following the identification of high potency, pharmacologically favorable compounds, we will test their efficacy  in animal models of poxvirus disease. These experiments will be carried out through an ongoing collaboration at  the CDC. The CDC will oversee testing of PDPMs against smallpox and in efficacy determination in animal  models of poxviral disease.  When these efforts are completed they will enable advanced (towards first-in-human) testing of a new class of  poxvirus inhibitor Ã¢Â€Â"" an inhibitor that has a mechanism of action complementary to the existing FDA approved  compound and a broad protection profile, fulfilling the need for multi-compound protection from these significant  human pathogens.",6,6a
P23447,SUPporting high quality evaluation of COVID-19 convalescent Plasma thrOughoutT Europe,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is provoking the greatest global health crisis of this generation. With no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment available to date, the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from recovered COVID-19 patients has been considered a potential curative strategy. To demonstrate its efficacy and safety, clinical studies are ongoing or planned in various EU Member States. Unfortunately, there lacks a coordinated approach involving a large number of blood establishments (BEs) and clinical centres to harmonise protocols and guidelines, to standardise assays for characterising the potency of the plasma and to validate clinical outcome which will be of great importance to ensure that significant conclusions can be drawn. SUPPORT-E brings together major European BEs with world leading research capabilities with the aim to support high quality clinical and scientific evaluation of COVID-19 CP (CCP) and thereby achieve a consensus on the appropriate use of CCP in the treatment of COVID-19 across EU Member States. Hence, SUPPORT-E will advance the current state-of-the-art by delivering the much needed harmonised evidence-based recommendations with respect to the use of CPP in clinical trials and monitored access programmes for COVID-19 patients in Europe. Further, standardised informative in vitro assays providing scientific insights that could support such recommendations will also be developed. SUPPORT-E offers an EU-wide collaboration between Member States, BEs and clinical centres in order to close the knowledge gap and to ensure applicability of the recommendations for all EU Members States. SUPPORT-E represents the first European Union coordinated research effort on passive immunotherapy, sharing data and protocols in real-time and pooling efforts to decrease the time as much as possible for validating CCP as a valid therapeutic treatment and also providing a basis for further optimisation by combined approaches with other anti-viral treatments.",4,4c

C10727,Deciphering immune responses in COVID-19 patients to identify immune correlates of protection and susceptibility for targeted therapeutics,"COVID-19 pandemic has already infected >30 M people, claimed >0.9 M lives and paralyzed economies globally. Despite the prior work on understanding how the virus impacts the immune system many questions have remained unanswered and, therefore, substantial efforts are urgently needed to understand them. We yet to understand immune correlates of recovery and protection from COVID-19 infection. Rationally design and evaluate novel vaccines and immunotherapies require a deeper understanding of how the virus interacts with the immune cells. Therefore, we plan to conduct a comprehensive study in detail at the cellular and molecular levels in COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease in our well-established longitudinal cohorts. We have already assembled a team of internationally-recognized immunologists, virologists, pulmonary medicine, intensive care and infectious disease experts to jointly address some of these issues.  Main Objective: To define protective and long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and delineate detrimental immunopathology in COVID-19 by undertaking in-depth immunological studies combined with viral studies and clinical data from the natural SARS-CoV-2 infection across different patient groups.  Detailed analyses of immune correlates of protection have the potential for a major impact, especially for those at risk from severe COVID-19. At the conclusion of this work in 3 years, we expect to have gained a thorough understanding of immune responses associated with the patient recovery and severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, especially in high-risk groups; fundamental for informing public-health policies needed to limit disease spread and protect high-risk groups.  Feasibility: Collectively, we have established the required breadth of expertise and cutting-edge techniques for COVID-19 research, as shown by our recent under review publications (Nature Communications x2).","1, 4","1d, 4b"
C09947,Brain Waves: Accessing creative cultural activity for people living with brain injury through and beyond the Covid-19 pandemic.,"Brain Waves will investigate the impact of the radical shift in the delivery of creative cultural activities for people living with brain injury during Covid-19 pandemic/lockdown and also the ongoing, and likely long-lived, changes in social interactions. We aim to move towards online/digital delivery, and to incorporate social distancing. In particular it will focus on the needs of two cohorts of people:  1. Patients recently discharged from hospital who, especially in the current context when community teams are less able to visit homes, fall between the cracks in terms of support.  2. People who access arts interventions as an essential part of their healthcare and recovery pathway and for whom self-expression through the arts is a key aspect of their reimagined identity and wellbeing.  It builds on the ground breaking work of Rosetta Life and partners through the Stroke Odysseys project, which itself is beginning the journey towards a delivery structure blending digital/online resources and face-to-face social distancing sessions and expands the benefits to other brain injuries including Parkinson's Disease, Dementia, Multiple Sclerosis and Motor Neuron Disease.  The work will have peoples' voices at the heart of the enquiry: people living with brain injury, healthcare professionals and artists involved in their care, and volunteer Ambassadors (that is, people living with brain injury who have already engaged in Rosetta Life's work and who want to offer peer support for people beginning their journey of rebuilding their lives post brain injury).   The project team brings together academics from a range of disciplines at King's College London, community investigators with expertise in performance, arts, healthcare and community engagement, and community partners (see below).  We will ask the following research questions: What is the impact of digital and socially distanced engagement in creative cultural activities on the wellbeing of people living with brain injury? And how do these impacts compare with current live face-to-face engagement? What are the benefits/opportunities here for the people who can access this online but wouldn't otherwise be able to, and how can they be reached?  How do we build community participation remotely, online and/or with social distancing in place? And how might this influence cultural programming? Do we need to rethink 'community' in general given the major shift to 'online'? Are there downsides i.e. can online sessions actually end up reinforcing loneliness the second they end and the participants alone again?  Is it feasible to upscale this participatory work via online resources? And if not, what is needed to support online delivery in socially distanced cultural programming? And how might these resources support the role of the socially engaged artist?  We will deliver:  An arts intervention that supports access to and engagement in creative cultural activities for at least 20 people living with brain injury - some of the most vulnerable and isolated people in our communities  A collaborative, key stakeholders partnership in the area of Kings Health Partners supporting the wellbeing of people living with brain injury  A set of online education training resources and a framework for artists, healthcare practitioners and the wider voluntary sector in order to test the potential for upscaling through socially distanced and online forums.  A research report publishing findings and the implications for arts, healthcare and community engagement practice  A conference event which draws together the key people and learning, made available across the UK via live streaming and recording.","9, 10","9b, 10b"

P22505,Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),"Project Summary  In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses  (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses  within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction  and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great  concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas.  Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species  harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown.  Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and  global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health  structures in Venezuela.   The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-  NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling  approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known  arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics,  map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within  these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other  vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these  samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine  learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on  prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing  human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a  particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity.  We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human  and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.   Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health  agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence  into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity  to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential  to avert full-blown emergence.","1,2, 3","1d, 2a, 3a, 3d"

Specifically, we propose to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enable chest x-ray radiography (CXR) as an alternative diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia, to rapidly triage patients for appropriate treatment, to monitor the treatment response in a contained environment, and to optimize the distribution of the limited medical resources during thecurrent COVID-19 crisis.",1,1a
C04626,Efficient geostatistical sampling to estimate the fraction of the population recovered from Covid-19,"The Covid-19 pandemic has a long course to run. Its successful management by governments and other international agencies will require statistical tools for real-time monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic over space and time. How covid-19 spreads across an urban area over time, for example whether there are small or large numbers of clusters, how large they are spatially, and how rapidly they grow, is poorly understood. Understanding local  phenomena can also support other research programmes and provide evidence to support future lockdown policies, for example how localised lockdowns need to be (city-wide versus neighbourhoods) and for how long. Local authorities may also use this evidence in support of highly targeted partial lockdown policies (such as differential application of the national Covid alert scale for different areas). Data sources that identify the location of cases can be used to generate predictions of the spread of Covid-19 cases over time and space, which will facilitate the implementation of localised policies to contain the spread of the virus. The aim of this project is to adapt statistical methods for this purpose and develop software for their implementation. This project will develop software for the real-time surveillance of Covid-19 that can be used with any georeferenced and time stamped data. We will use data on hospital attendances and admissions for Covid-19 to develop, calibrate, and test our software and models. We will build on state-of-the-art geostatistical software developed by the co-applicants to produce estimates and predictions of incidence or the ""R number"" across an area of interest based on available data sources. These outputs can also support the design of scheme to sample the population for testing when such programmes are rolled out, for which we will also include functionality.",3,"3a, 3c"
C07400,Suppressing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in public spaces through surface engineering,"The exploration of different ways in which the current Covid-19 pandemic can be kept controlled is crucial to enable reopening the society and ensure a flourishing economy. While a successful vaccine would be the ideal way to put a halt on the pandemic, a rapid deployment is not guaranteed, and may not happen for sometime. Short of a vaccine, measures that can prevent spreading the infection are an important alternative. Apart from airborne direct transmission, indirect transmission via surfaces, in particular in public spaces, can play an important role in spreading the disease. We propose the development and identification of routes for easy deployment of surface materials and coatings that can actively inhibit and retard the spread of the virus from an infected person to others via touch surfaces, by deactivating it. This would potentially be a game changer for ""high-traffic"" surfaces in public spaces. We will build on existing knowledge about the antiviral properties of copper, and seek to optimize them.",5,5b

P22773,Kaiser Washington Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit,"Abstract  Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to human health, with many types of infections having  far-reaching, global consequences. The ability to develop vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics to  prevent, treat, and identify infectious diseases is a critical public health need. Clinical trials are an integral  component of these development efforts. Since the 1960s the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units  (VTEUs) have conducted trials that have evaluated promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates for infectious  diseases such as influenza (including pandemic and avian influenza), malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal  infection, in children and adults. In addition, the VTEUs have quickly launched trials in response to newly  emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, and Waves 1 and  5 of the H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks in China. These efforts have provided data that informed public health  policy.  This proposal is in response to a new VTEU structure which will involve greater collaboration between the  VTEUs, NIAID, and the newly formed Leadership Group structure that are all part of the NIAID Infectious  Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). The IDCRC will enhance integration and efficiency of  operations and, importantly, will foster the collaborative team science approaches now recognized as optimal  to address important and complicated public health research priorities.  Under the new cooperative agreement, the Kaiser Washington VTEU will continue to conduct clinical research  and trials, including trials conducted under an IND or IDE, within the Kaiser Washington integrated care system  to contribute to the priority research foci of NIAID. These priority areas include malaria, influenza and other  respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections and include clinical trials, including human challenge models,  and pharmacokinetic studies. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Seattle area infectious  disease research partners who will provide scientific expertise, specialized facilities, and advanced  immunologic laboratory capabilities. The Kaiser Washington VTEU will also develop and maintain surge  capacity for clinical site, pharmacy and laboratory operations to enable the rapid initiation of clinical trials and  other studies in response to emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats of public health importance.","4, 6, 7","4e, 6j, 7j"
C14350,Application of multiscale algebra and topology to understanding heterogeneity in the immune response to SARS CoV 2 infection,"The basis of variability between patients in their immune response and outcome from acute SARS-Cov-2 infection remains poorly defined, limiting opportunities for targetted intervention. The generation of multi-modal molecular and immunological data sets profiling the immune response across individuals and over time provides opportunities to address this but maximising the informativeness of such datasets remains a major roadblock. Here, we propose to address this through application of state-of-the-art integrative mathematical and computational techniques to analyse data together and extract novel insights. We will use algebraic systems biology approaches to combine algebraic geometry, data tensors, topological data analysis and network theory to encode multidimensional and multi-indexed data in order to identify signatures and cellular drivers of heterogeneity in the host immune response leading to different disease severity. We will apply this to data recently generated by the Oxford COVID-19 Multi-Omic Blood ATlas (COMBAT) consortium which includes high resolution clinical phenotyping, single cell profiling of the cellular blood compartment for composition, repertoire, transcriptomics and epigenomics, the plasma secretome, serology, viral sequencing, metagenomics and host genotyping. Our application is timely and urgent given availability of data and opportunity for impact. The work will promote collaboration between medical and mathematical sciences, promoting cross-disciplinarity. The analysis will provide novel insights into pathophysiology, identify key networks and nodal points for targetted intervention that will enable development of immunmodulatory therapy, and define biomarkers informative for the individual immune response that can be taken forward for validation and enable development of a precision medicine approach to COVID-19.","1, 4","1c, 1d, 4b"
C15204,Structural Dynamics of Translation,"The Central Dogma of molecular biology is that DNA is used to make mRNA, which in turn is used to make  proteins. Central to physiology of every live cell, translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is  catalyzed by the ribosome, structurally complex and dynamic macromolecular machine. Dysregulation of  translation plays an important role in a number of human diseases including cancer. While some fundamentals  of protein synthesis have been revealed, many molecular details of ribosomal translation remain unknown. For  example, it is unclear why some mRNAs are translated orders of magnitude more efficiently than the others,  and how mRNA structure regulates protein synthesis. My laboratory investigates molecular mechanisms of  translation by studying structural dynamics of the ribosome, and the role of mRNA secondary structure in  translation regulation. We use single-molecule microscopy and biochemical approaches to address the  following questions: (i) How does the small ribosomal subunit move along mRNA in search for the start site for  translation initiation in eukaryotes? (ii) How does the intrinsic compactness of mRNA and intramolecular  basepairing interactions formed by the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA regulate the efficiency  of protein synthesis in eukaryotes? (iii) How do mRNA stem-loop structures induce ribosome translation  pauses, which control expression of a number of proteins in bacteria, eukaryotes and eukaryotic viruses,  including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2? (iv)  How are structural dynamics of eukaryotic ribosome (in particular, rotational movements between the small  and the large ribosomal subunits) converted into the intricate process of protein synthesis? Our studies will  substantially contribute to establishing the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis, and provide the basis  for the future development of antiviral and cancer therapies.",1,"1b, 1c"

Leflunomide is a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, impacting pyrimidine synthesis for DNA and RNA production, and has been in use for over 20 years for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus with an excellent safety profile [1, 2]. It has known anti-viral activity and has been applied against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and polyoma BK virus infections in immunocompromised hosts [3, 4]. Leflunomide is orally available and exhibits hepatic clearance and a long elimination half-life. In vitro and in vivo experiments conducted in Wuhan, China demonstrated DHODH inhibitors have activity against COVID-19, including teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide [5]. Moreover, our preliminary data at City of Hope also suggest that leflunomide significantly arrests viral RNA replication in cancer cells infected with a naturally-occurring RNA virus (reovirus) and impairs ex vivo IL-6 expression in virally infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).",6,"6d, 6g"
C04112,GCRF_NF109: GCRFCV19@ukri.org African elections during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Elections involve increased risks of the spread of COVID-19, with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) highlighting more than 40 stages where people assemble, or objects are transferred during the electoral cycle. Despite these risks, a number of elections have already taken place in Africa during the pandemic, including those in Mali, Guinea, and Burundi. Nine more elections are due to take place in Africa before the end of 2020, and there are 18 scheduled for 2021. Reducing the risks of increased transmission during these elections is paramount, particularly as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recently declared that the pandemic is accelerating on the continent. By following three elections (in Tanzania, Ghana and the Central African Republic) from beginning to end, we will look closely at each stage of the electoral process and how the risks of COVID-19 transmission have been mitigated (if at all). We will also chart the extent to which holding elections has had a demonstrable effect on infection rates. Secondly, we aim to assess whether and how the pandemic affects political participation. We will evaluate whether the ability of any social (including gendered) groups or geographic populations to engage in the political process is reduced, either unintentionally or deliberately. These public health and governance foci will allow us to produce detailed, evidence-based, and context-specific recommendations that can be applied to upcoming African elections.

C06188,Primary care Networks,"Background In its 2014 Five Year Forward View, NHS England (now NHS England and Improvement) identified the need for new models of care to improve collaboration across health and social care services. This plan suggested that GP practices work together (and with other primary care providers) in a more systematic, sustained and organised manner. As a result, primary care networks were introduced in 2019 to bring together groups of general practices to hold shared budgets through a collective contract, and develop new and more integrated services. Hence, primary care networks have a formal, incentivised and almost compulsory feel compared to many predecessor schemes of collaborative primary care. There were (in May 2020) 1259 primary care networks in England, serving populations ranging from 20,000 to well above the 50,000 suggested in national guidance. Networks sometimes build on prior GP collaborations such as super-partnerships or federations, which can provide organisational infrastructure and support to newly formed networks. However, some primary care networks also bring together practices that had not worked collaboratively in the past.     Objectives The purpose of this evaluation was to produce early evidence of the development and implementation of primary care networks. We sought to answer these research questions (RQs): RQ1: What was the policy context within which primary care networks were introduced?   RQ1.1: What were the pre-existing forms of GP collaborative working across primary care in England?   RQ 1.2: How have new networks been implemented in a sample of urban and rural settings?   RQ 1.3: How do new primary care networks relate to pre-existing GP collaborations?   RQ2: What was the rationale and motives for general practices to enter into new primary care networks?   RQ3: What evidence exists about the impact of establishing GP collaborations and how does this relate to primary care networks?   RQ4: What are the barriers to and facilitators of effective collaboration across GP practices?   RQ5: What does this evidence suggest in terms of the likely progress of primary care networks in the NHS in England, including in light of the Covid-19 pandemic?     Methods A mixed methods cross-comparative case study evaluation with four case study sites, comprising four work packages (WPs): WP1: Rapid evidence assessment: We conducted a review of published evidence on GP collaborations to inform the design of our evaluation. This included English-language evidence summaries (published from 1998-2012) and primary care research studies and reviews (published from 2013-2018), using key search terms in titles and abstracts in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus. WP2: Stakeholder workshop: We held a workshop with academics, policy experts and patient and public involvement representatives, to explore findings from the rapid evidence assessment. This enabled us to clarify evidence gaps and develop evaluation questions for WP3. WP3: Comparative case studies of four primary care networks: We undertook multi-faceted sampling to select four rural and urban case study sites. Interviewees (N=25) were purposively sampled and asked about the primary care network, its implementation, facilitators, barriers and early impact. We collected data through: analysis of key documentation; non-participant observations (N=10) of strategic meetings; and an online survey (N=28) of network staff. We used content analysis for documentary reviews and observations, and framework analysis for interview data. The Covid-19 pandemic caused data collection to cease earlier than planned.     WP4: Analysis and conclusions: We synthesised our findings to develop suggested lessons for commissioners, providers and policy makers about the future development of primary care networks. Results The rapid evidence assessment identified important lessons for primary care networks, including the time required for networks to become properly established, and the level of high-quality management and leadership capacity required for success. The review also revealed the wide range of formal and informal collaborations across English primary care, and their importance as context for the implementation of primary care networks. Key themes from our data analysis were: Purpose of primary care networks Leaders of primary care networks support the overarching policy aims, and general practices across England have seized the opportunity to access new funding to form networks. Although keen to improve service integration, primary care networks often prioritise the sustainability of general practice, addressing workload pressures, and improving the availability of local primary care services. Primary care networks are expected to meet local population health needs, whilst meeting nationally-specified requirements to employ certain professionals and introduce defined services, which was a source of tension for the primary care networks in our evaluation. Prior GP collaborations In all four case studies, the new primary care network was established in the context of a prior GP collaboration. These helped the networks build on previous successes such as strong relationships between practices and integrated service delivery. Prior collaborations often provided the new network with additional operational and management support. There were also some tensions where the new network was perceived as un-doing the work of the previous collaboration, where aims of the two organisations did not align, or where practices from two previous collaborations joined a single network. Engagement in primary care networks This evaluation revealed a tension between the desire for local autonomy within primary care networks, and the top-down nature of national PCN policy. This led to some differences between local and national priorities, and struggles with local clinical commissioning groups. Networks were therefore aware of the need to take time to clarify roles of primary care networks within the local health system, and develop shared goals and objectives within the network itself. Time and resource for organisational development were important for this process, including through staff away days, and joint training events across the primary care network. Leadership and management The need for effective leadership and management support for primary care networks was a strong theme in the evaluation, particularly the capacity required for implementing and managing networks (e.g. for meetings, recruitment of staff, implementing new services). Time pressures for those leading network development was reported as an acute concern, especially for clinical directors and practice managers. The range of leadership and management expertise on the part of network clinical directors raised a concern about the sustainability of these roles longer term. Funding and incentives A consistent message was that primary care networks had been established in a near universal manner due to NHS England and Improvement using them as the mechanism to offer significant funding to general practices. For some respondents, the experience of setting up the primary care network, establishing cross-practice working, and having to use new resources largely to deliver services required by NHS England and Improvement, had led to frustration and even talk of leaving the network. This was based on an assessment of the work entailed in running a primary care network and its shared services, and the burden experienced by practices 'losing' GP and management time to support the new organisation. Relationship with the wider NHS system The relationship between clinical commissioning groups and primary care networks varied - some clinical commissioning groups had supported networks development, providing resource and expertise to help establish inter-practice working, hire new staff, and operate contracts. Others had attempted to hold onto control delegated to primary care networks, closely monitoring budgets and spending decisions, and not operating within the spirit of national PCN policy. This evaluation took place during the first nine months of operation of primary care networks when they in their formative phase, learning how to work as a collective of practices, and forming relationships with their clinical commissioning group(s), local NHS trusts, and other partners. The experience of rural primary care networks We sought to study the experience of rural as well as urban primary care networks. Two of our case studies were in rural areas while another was semi-rural. Some of those in more rural areas felt that national PCN policy had been developed more with urban networks in mind, not accounting adequately for the experience of providing primary care in rural areas. A key aspect cited was that rural primary care has well-established ways of collaborating to meet local service needs, and patient populations who may be unwilling or unable to travel further to access new shared services.     Conclusion We propose the following implications for local and national decision makers:   1) increasing engagement of GP practices and wider primary care teams with primary care networks;   2) building further leadership and management capacity; and 3) clarifying how primary care networks fit into the wider health and social care system, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath.     In further research, a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures will be needed to understand how networks contribute to improved sustainability, efficiency and integration in and beyond primary care. Studies will need to answer the question: do general practices need to collaborate to achieve these outcomes and if so, what policy, support and investment are required?",11,11y

The United States (U.S.) has experienced higher mortality than any other nation due to COVID-19 with nearly  13.5 million cases and over 268,103 deaths. Due to the limited ability to socially distance, poor ventilation, and  limited hygiene supplies, U.S. prisons and jails have observed explosive transmission of SARS-CoV-2  accounting for the 10 largest U.S. outbreaks. Because 95% of criminal justice-involved individuals reenter society  COVID-19 transmission extends beyond those who are currently incarcerated. As justice-involved individuals  reenter the community, they face high rates of homelessness, and many others live in other congregate settings  such as converted hotels and halfway houses. The increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 while incarcerated coupled  with the likelihood of living in congregate settings after incarceration, create conditions ripe for rapid COVID-19  transmission that will be critical to address in order to gain control of COVID-19 in the U.S. The goal of this study  is to test the impact and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among  justice-involved individuals recently released from incarceration. We will conduct a randomized trial to compare  the effectiveness of an onsite Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2 testing and education intervention with community  health workers (CHWs) as a central component compared to the standard of care at a community-based  organization (CBO) that provides services to justice-involved individuals in New York City. We will measure costs  of testing, education, and navigation, and explore the cost-effectiveness of the onsite Point-of-Care intervention  compared to the standard of care. Our specific aims are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-  CoV-2 intervention in a corrections-focused CBO; 2) Model the cost-effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-CoV-  2 intervention among CJIs compared to SoC. Because testing, education, and navigation will be provided by  CHWs in a culturally-sensitive environment and test results will be received in minutes (rather than days), we  hypothesize that O-PoC will be associated with improved testing uptake and receipt of test results, mitigation  behaviors (mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing), and those who attend more O-PoC sessions will  have better adherence to mitigation behaviors.","5, 9","5b, 9a"

C06887,Dynamic Interactions of the S-Nitrosoproteome in Type 2 Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease,"COVID-19-Related Administrative Supplement to NIA RF1 AG057409 under PA-18-591 and NOT-AG-20-022Project Summary: Epidemiological studies of pandemic COVID-19 suggest that aged populations, especially those withAlzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD)/ADRD, are particularly vulnerable. We therefore propose anAdministrative Supplement for work in line with the Division of Neuroscience at NIA, namely, ""studies aimed atdiscovery and development of novel drugs, as well as repurposing and repositioning existing drugs, forpreventing and treating COVID-19, particularly drugs that are specific for COVID-19 related CNS targets andCNS mechanisms related to or driving the viral-mediated pathophysiology."" Specifically, we will test drugsdeveloped in the parent RF1 award by screening them for anti-viral activity to fight the infection andtreat potential CNS ramifications in AD/ADRD and aged populations. Intriguingly, aminoadamantanedrugs (e.g., amantadine, rimantadine, and memantine) were first discovered as anti-viral agents because theycan block the ion channel found in the envelope of viruses such as influenza, but also found in the SARS-CoVfamily. The PI, Dr. Lipton, subsequently found that these aminoadamantanes had activity in the CNS byblocking excessively-activated NMDAR-associated ion channels, and Lipton's work eventually led to FDAapproval of memantine for use in AD. Recently, the Lipton group designed and synthesized aminoadamantanenitrate drugs under the auspices of the parent RF1 Award to be used to inhibit excessively-activated NMDARsto a much higher degree than memantine by adding a nitro-based warhead to an aminoadamantane in order toS-nitrosylate (via covalent reaction of NO) and thus further inhibit receptor activity in a targeted fashion. As aseemingly amazing coincidence, it was recently reported that the SARS-CoV family of viruses are susceptibleto NO, in part by inhibiting their replication cycle. However, the delivery of NO or a NO-related species to analready ill patient could have severe consequences, such as lowering the blood pressure dramatically. Hence,in this proposal we develop a novel targeted delivery of NO-related species directly to the SARS-CoV-2 virusby using the aminoadamantane moiety that binds to the envelope ion channel and has a nitro-based warheadthat it then delivers directly to the virus. Another critical feature of the current proposal is that we use thesesame aminoadamantane nitrate compounds to protect the brain from injury potentially engendered by the virusvia inhibition of excessive NMDAR activity. Importantly, up to 37% of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 reportedly display neurological sequelae. Mechanistically in this regard, in the face of severe viral infections,including coronaviruses, excessive levels of glutamate are released (or not taken up) by astrocytes, leading toglutamate-related neurotoxicity (excitotoxicity). In our parent RF1 grant, we reported similar findings in AD, i.e.,that Aß-stimulated astrocytes release glutamate onto neurons. Therefore, this Administrative Supplement willtest the top 'hits' of aminoadamantane nitrates capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in additional screens for theirability to prevent viral-related damage to neurons in the brains of AD/ADRD and aged populations.",6,"6a, 6g"

P23604,Novel COVID-19 POC Screening Tool Based on  Proprietary Nano-Sensors and ML Techniques,"The NanoScent core technology is based on proprietary and patent-protected nano sensors coupled with machine learning algorithms. At the heart of the solution is the ability of sensing and recognizing scents. Combining novel chemical nano sensors with advanced machine learning techniques, NanoScent technology tackles the challenging tasks of VOCs detection faced by the industry, organizations, authorities and individuals. NanoScent scent recognition system consists of low-cost, easy-to-use, fast-responding, high-sensitive Chemiresistor Sensors; Scent Recorder; and Scent Recognition Software.  There is no effective method for early stage screening COVID-19, for the purpose of effective virus spread prevention. For example, gold standard -PCR method has 'Ç¨100s cost, intended for use by professionals at qualified laboratories, and has 1-2 days result delivery time, in contrast real-time and low-cost thermometer method has very low sensitivity and specificity, meaning that many people infected in COVID-19 may not be identified on time and immediately be isolated from healthy people. We truly believe that our technology could serve to help in the global effort of effective prevention of the spread of viruses. We are already commercializing our application for different industries. The COVID-19 and a long list of potential clients contacting us for a solution made us prioritize the detection of COVID-19.  Founded in 2017 by two experienced entrepreneurs and industry experts, NanoScent Ltd. is developing a scent recognition technology for the aims of people safety, personal wellbeing, environmental protection and energy efficiency. NanoScent offers a system to visualize scent 'Äì scientifically referred to as a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in order to let industry, organizations, authorities and individuals make better decisions based on a new set of 'Äòeyes'Äô on everyday processes with an aim to protect the community from dangerous compounds.",1,1a

The overarching objective of this project is to understand these non-intended consequences and to devise improved health, economic and social policies. In our policy recommendations, we strive to make healthcare systems and societies in the EU more resilient to pandemics in terms of prevention, protection and treatment of the population 50+, a most vulnerable part of the population.  The project aims to identify healthcare inequalities before, during and after the pandemic; to understand the lockdown effects on health and health behaviours; to analyse labour market implications of the lockdown; to assess the impacts of pandemic and lockdown on income and wealth inequality; to mitigate the effects of epidemic control decisions on social relationships; to optimise future epidemic control measures by taking the geographical patterns of the disease and their relationship with social patterns into account; and to better manage housing and living arrangements choices between independence, co-residence or institutionalisation.  The project pursues a transdisciplinary and internationally comparative approach by exploiting the data sources of the SHARE research infrastructure. It covers all EU MS. The project's team represents medicine, public health, economics and sociology and has worked together since the creation of SHARE. It is experienced in translating data analysis into concrete policy advice.

C03624,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in women and their young infants in Kampala, Uganda","Uganda's first confirmed COVID-19 case was recently identified by our collaborating partner in Entebbe. By 29th of March, 33 cases had been confirmed. The high urban population density, extensive and unavoidable social interaction in urban and rural areas, in some areas compounded by challenging hygienic conditions, represent major challenges to the containment of the COVID-19 epidemic in the country.    To obtain a population-based description of the evolving COVID-19 epidemic, we will enroll women in labor, and follow them and their young infants for 14 weeks. Concretely, we will describe the evolving epidemic in three neighborhoods in Kampala and identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and for COVID-19 as well as its health consequences in our study participants. While the women are likely to mirror the general young adult population with respect to the infection and the disease , the study will also have a particular focus on the large vulnerable group of HIV-positive women and their babies.    By including data from a large ongoing randomized controlled trial, an interrupted time-series analysis in both HIV-1 positive mothers and their young infants will describe the impact not only of COVID-19 but also of the recently implemented restrictions on people's movement. We will also examine how these and other measures to contain the epidemic are understood and experienced by women and their families, and explore possible implications for health seeking behaviors. We will also examine the health consequences, beyond that of COVID-19, with the intention of helping to realign the implemented actions to balance their population benefits and risks and suggest strategies to mitigate the latter.    The proposed project also encompasses an expansion of a large ongoing randomized controlled trial to examine if BCG vaccination protects HIV-1 exposed young infants not only against Possible Severe Bacterial Infection but also against COVID-19.","4, 5, 7, 9, 11","4a, 5a, 7a, 9a, 9e, 10a"
C00821,Identifying host factors as drug targets and drugs employing RNAi knockdown screens,"Abstract: We aim to identify and effectively inhibit host dependency factors being essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread, following a systematic screening approach. Human epithelial cells will be seeded in ""ready to transfect"" multiwell plates, designed and produced in the laboratory of HE. Those plates are containing dried siRNA/transfection reagent complexes. When the cells attach to the surface, reverse transfection enables siRNA mediated knockdown of a single gene, in high-throughput. Then, the cells will be infected with clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected by SC and cCytopathic effect and MTT assays performed. After inactivation by paraformaldehyde, these transportable plates will be sent to the lab of HE who will elaborately phenotype the cells using an established imaging pipeline. RK will compare the hits from the screen to time-lapse proteomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infected human epithelial host cells (data was derived from SC recently), omics data from other coronavirus infection studies, and gene associations to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This will lead to a short list of host dependency factors for which drugs will be selected employing publicly available drug databases. Selected host factors and drugs will be validated in the lab of SC employing a broad selection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In addition, RK will infer a SARS-CoV-2 specific protein interaction network and identify clusters of host factors to get drug combinations, which will be experimentally validated by SC. We will yield an effective drug treatment for COVID-19 therapy and prevention.; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable",6,6a
P22326,Understanding the mechanisms of antibody-mediated transcytosis of ZIKV within the placenta,"Humoral immunity is an essential component of the immune response to flavivirus infection. Primary infection generates a robust neutralizing antibody response that mediates viral control and protection. It is becoming increasingly apparent that secondary infection with a closely related flavivirus strain can result in immunological cross-reactivity; however, the consequences to infection outcome are hotly debated and controversial. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which has a high degree of sequence and structural homology to Dengue virus (DENV), and is responsible for continuing epidemics of fetal congenital malformations within the Americas since its introduction to Brazil in 2015. Prior flavivirus exposure has been strongly associated with generation of cross-reactive antibodies that bind to and/or neutralize ZIKV. A unique aspect of ZIKV pathogenesis is the ability of the virus to seed infection within the placenta, however, the mechanisms of transplacental ZIKV infection are not well understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how cross-reactive antibodies facilitate ZIKV transcytosis and seed infection of the placenta. The placenta is composed of anchoring chorionic villi, which penetrate the uterine wall, as well as floating chorionic villi that are bathed in maternal blood pooling in the intervillous space. Recent epidemiological observations found that between 20-50% of pregnant women with possible ZIKV exposure had detectable ZIKV RNA in the placenta. Another report found that ZIKV can persist in the placenta for over 200 days post mother onset of Zika symptoms. We discovered that Hofbauer cells, fetally- derived placental macrophages located within the villus stroma, are permissive for ZIKV infection. To identify a potential mechanism by which ZIKV gains access to the villous stroma, we recently evaluated the impact of cross-reactive dengue antibodies in mediating transplacental infection. Using an ex vivo placental explant model, we observed profound enhancement of ZIKV infection of human mid-gestation floating chorionic villi with ZIKV immune complexes generated using either DENV or ZIKV cross-reactive convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies. Similar to histological analysis of placenta from infected pregnant mothers, ZIKV replicated exclusively within Hofbauer cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the Fab fragment (specificity for ZIKV) and the Fc domain (affinity for FcRn and FcÃŽÂ³R) of IgG impacts antibody-mediated ZIKV transplacental infection. Moreover, we believe that gestational age of the placenta dynamically influences the efficiency of ZIKV transcytosis and placental infection. Moreover, we believe that gestational age of the placenta dynamically impacts ZIKV transcytosis and placental infection. In this proposal, we seek to address the following outstanding questions: 1) How does IgG antibody specificity, affinity and Fc/FcRn interactions impact ZIKV transplacental infection? and 2) How does placental gestational age impacts antibody-mediated infection of Hofbauer cells? Our studies will likely reveal therapeutic targets and provide insights for development a vaccine to protect against ZIKV infection.",4,4b
P23041,Olfactory modulation of color vision and behavior in mosquitoes,"PROJECT SUMMARY  This application aims to build on our recent discoveries of olfactory Ã¢Â€ÂœgatingÃ¢Â€Â of visual attraction in Aedes aegypti  mosquitoes and determine the role of color vision in host and nectar selection. Without vision, mosquitoes  cannot track odors, locate hosts, or find mates. Vision is a critical sensory modality involved in long-range  olfactory search behaviors and near-host behaviors involved in landing and biting. Despite this potential  importance, little is known about vision in anthropophilic mosquitoes and the neural bases of these behaviors.  Mosquitoes can see a host from 2-15 m, and our recent findings show that odor Ã¢Â€Âœturns onÃ¢Â€Â their visual attraction  to hosts, thereby playing a critical role by linking long-distance odor tracking with short-range behaviors near the  host. Our work also demonstrated that mosquitoes are sensitive to wavelengths reflected from human skin.  However, we lack an understanding of how odor sensitizes the visual system, and the visual preferences of  diverse anthropophilic mosquitoes. We have developed new tools to examine olfactory-visual integration,  including new Aedes GCaMP6s mosquito lines, the generation of opsin knockout lines, and biogenic amine  receptor mutants. This proposal builds on our preliminary findings that demonstrate the importance of color  vision and neuromodulators in olfactory-visual integration in mosquitoes. Using semi-field and behavioral  assays, calcium imaging in tethered flying mosquitoes, and molecular-genetic approaches, we propose to study  the color preferences of mosquitoes and how odor modulates visual neurons. Aim 1 will allow us to characterize  the colors (wavelengths) that attract different anthropophilic mosquito species and identify the odors that turn on  visual search behaviors. In Aim 2, using Aedes aegypti, we will determine the neural mechanisms by which  odors turn on visual search behaviors, and identify the rhodopsins that detect important wavelengths. Our  preliminary results indicate that octopamine is critical for olfactory-visual integration. We will generate cell-  specific knockout of the octopamine receptor to determine how olfactory-visual behaviors are compromised. In  parallel, we will mutate specific long- and short-wavelength rhodopsins to suppress attraction to colors indicating  hosts or nectar sources. We will also use new GCaMP6s lines to record from visual neurons in the mosquito  brain and characterize how odor modulates those neurons. Aim 3 will test the wavelengths and visual features  (motion, object size) that mosquitoes find attractive, and test them in new trap designs in semi-field trials.  While there has been extensive work on olfaction in mosquitoes, our work emphasizes that color vision also  plays a key role. Olfactory-visual integration is vital in diverse insect vectors, including tsetse flies and kissing  bugs. We suggest that our proposed experiments provide a basic framework for understanding how these cues  influence haematophagous insects. Furthermore, results from this work will provide information on attractive  visual lures, and motivate the identification of molecular targets to cripple visual-olfactory behaviors.",2,2b
C19524,Automate ISO-certified DNA screening platform to enhance the global food supply chain,"Food recalls, costly mitigation measure following the evidence of contaminated, adulterating or counterfeiting foods are daily. It can cost several milions to take back the food company and cause severe damages to the brand. Lab tests, detecting food contaminants can take up to seven days and are thus not compatible with fresh-food processes.   The BEAMit-up platform that will bring the global food supply chain to the upper level of safety is composed of a hardware, capsules and a cloud solution. The capsule integrates a rapid DNA screening, developed and patented by SwissDeCode. Placed at the point-of-care, the BEAMit-up platform will certify the presence of pathogens or identify pork in beef meat in only 30 minutes. An ISO 17025 certificate will be released by SwissDeCode for each test.   We will validate the BEAMit-up platform early access programs: We supply hardware and capsules to the customer who will perform a pre-defined number of tests per week. We will investigate the presence of Listeria, milk proteins, and pork. We will also use the platform to certify cheese and basmati rice.   SwissDeCode estimates a positive EBITDA at 5 years of €6.8M with a company growth to 200 employees.   To tackle the SARS-CoV-2, rapid and accurate detection methods are needed. Since the beginning of March, SwissDeCode collaborates with The Genova Hospital to extend the core technology to the detection of the virus. Preliminary tests were sent to the virology labs of the hospital and will be tested with patient samples. With the support of the EC, SwissDeCode can bring this new test to the hospital within few months only.",1,1a
C07306,"Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on criminal justice journeys of adult and child survivors of sexual abuse, rape, and sexual assault","Over 150,000 sexual offences were recorded by police in year ending March 2020 (ONS, 2020), and there are indications that lockdown increased some sexual offences (e.g. online-facilitated abuse, or sexual abuse perpetrated by family members) and decreased others (e.g. assaults by strangers/peers). However, there has been no research into the specific effects of Covid-19 on criminal justice system (CJS) policies and practices relating to sexual offences, nor on the journeys of survivors through the CJS during this period.  Prior to the pandemic, there were significant challenges for the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences and conviction rates were extremely low. Some of these challenges may well have been exacerbated by Covid-19 and lockdown e.g. further delays to investigating cases, postponement of Achieving Best Evidence interviews. At the same time, however, Covid-19 has generated significant innovation within the CJS, e.g. the introduction of a video platform within the courts enabling all parties in a criminal hearing to engage securely and remotely, and this may sow the seeds for improvement in survivors' journeys through the CJS.  Drawing on the perspectives and experiences of CJS stakeholders, including complainants and families, police, Crown Prosecution Service, HM Courts and Tribunals Services, the Judiciary, Sexual Assault Referral Centres, and Independent Sexual Violence Advisors, this research will provide unique insights into the impact of the pandemic on the CJS in sexual offence cases. Changes to procedures precipitated by Covid-19 might offer longer-term benefits for survivors and stakeholders and we aim to identify these and promote their implementation.",10,"10b, 10d"
P22071,Implications of sequential bloodmeals on arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes,"Brackney & Armstrong  Abstract:   Aedes aegypti is the primary vector for a number of human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV;  Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae,  Alphavirus) and yellow fever virus (YFV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), all of which present a continued threat to  human health worldwide. Understanding the endemic and epidemic risk of these arthropod-borne (arbo-)  viruses is critical to the success of public health preparedness and intervention. One key entomological  parameter informing risk estimates is vector competence (how able a mosquito is to become infected and  transmit an arbovirus; VC). Quantifying the competency of local vector populations can help inform the risk that  any one pathogen poses to a given community. This is often quantified in the laboratory by exposing  populations of local mosquitoes to an infectious bloodmeal and harvesting tissues at set time-points post  infection. While informative, this approach often fails to consider the biology and behavior of the vector  mosquito. For example, it is known that wild Ae. aegypti mosquitoes will imbibe several bloodmeals over the  course of a traditional laboratory-based vector competence study (e.g. bloodmeal every two to three days). To  address these shortcomings, we recently began examining the effects that multiple blood feeding episodes  have on the competency of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes for ZIKV. Our preliminary findings reveal that providing a  second non-infectious bloodmeal to ZIKV infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes enhances viral escape from the  midgut and significantly shortens the duration between mosquito acquisition of ZIKV to transmission. In this  application we will examine the effects that multiple bloodfeeding episodes have on arbovirus infection of and  transmission by vector mosquitoes. Specifically, we will be 1) testing this phenomenon in other virus-vector  pairings, 2) evaluating the role of the midgut basal lamina in mediating the double-feed phenotype and 3)  determining if similar processes are mediating the ability of arboviruses to infect ovarian tissue and be  transmitted vertically.",2,2b
P25547,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) seroprevalence in zoonotic reservoirs and in humans: implications for spillover risk and population underlying infection,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease of global importance that is currently mainly transmitted to humans from camels, although it is still unclear how the pathogen spreads and infects individuals across time and geography. Understanding its epidemiologic characteristics via serology (e.g. blood tests that measure the level of antibodies) is key to producing accurate estimates of future animal-human transmission and in turn, implementing public health measures to prevent this risk of ""spillover"". Barriers to this understanding, however, include the lack of unified and timely serology data, as well as limited awareness of population immunity. To address these barriers, an innovative and continuously updated synthesis and analysis of MERS seroprevalence will be conducted, which will include both academic and non-academic sources. The results will also be visualized on an interactive data web platform. This unique and streamlined approach will in turn inform estimates of MERS prevalence, possible cross-immunity from prior infection/vaccination against COVID-19, and spillover risk, thus facilitating vital insights for use by policy, research and clinical decision-makers in an era of pandemic preparedness. The culmination of this MERS case study will centralize access to MERS serology data, illustrate the feasibility and structure of a unified serosurveillance system, and highlight the design of a tailored data platform for pandemic preparedness. Ultimately, these efforts will build crucial capacity to monitor coronaviruses and other emerging infectious disease threats on a global scale.","1, 3, 9","1d, 3d, 9e"

Public health infectious disease researchers and practitioners are increasingly seeking computational skills to aid their analysis, comprehension and research translation activities. However, acquiring this level of topic specific and advanced bioinformatics knowledge and skills is challenging because adequate training programs are scarce. The Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops proposal herein seeks CIHR funding to redevelop its 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology' workshop and to provide accessible training opportunities to Canadians for immediate skill development in the cutting-edge bioinformatics resources and tools necessary for pathogen research. The updated 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology' workshop will be an intensive 4-day, virtual hands-on workshop designed to guide researchers through the key bioinformatics concepts and tools required to analyze pathogen genomic data sets and integrate epidemiological data. Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to: 1) understand next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms as applied to pathogen genomics and metagenomics sequencing; 2) analyze NGS data for pathogen surveillance and outbreak investigations; 3) identify and analyze antimicrobial resistance genes; 4) detect emerging pathogens from metagenomics datasets; 5) perform phylodynamic analysis on these datasets; and 6) use visualization tools for genomic epidemiology analysis.

C09523,Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,"Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatileorganic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensingdevice that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automateddata processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use withthe aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOCbiomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally.Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaledbreath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2,even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samplesfrom COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC-MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC DavisMedical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPIDr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven trackrecord to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysisdevice using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-basedgas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperaturesand pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip-based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and willcompare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip fromDeviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, andunder direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of researchengineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guidedevelopment of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligencecapabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands ofclinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device andreturn to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS datagenerated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towardsthe end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scaleproduction and deployment of the device for clinical approval.

C04730,Grand Challenge Network+ in Proton Therapy,"The aim is to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on proton therapy and radiotherapy (RT) services  more generally at national and regional level across the UK. We will use our mathematical model of  radiotherapy demand (MALTHUS) which was commissioned for the NHS by Prof Sir Mike Richards  when he was Cancer Czar. Through adapting MALTHUS we will be able to understand the impact of  COVID-19 on radiotherapy practice across the UK and to use it as a scenario modelling tool to  provide a long-term assessment of how the provision of radiotherapy will change for different  cancer anatomical sites as a result of COVID-19.  MALTHUS uses factors relating to patient case-mix, indications for radiotherapy treatment and  evidence-based radiotherapy fractionation which are encoded into decision trees representing  cancers treated by radiotherapy. Base data for local-level population and cancer registrations were  obtained from the National Cancer Intelligence Network and Office of National Statistics. Malthus  uses a sophisticated discrete-event simulation algorithm that can provide statistically robust  estimates of treatment demand.  MALTHUS will be adapted to include new RT evidence and protocols, which reflect the current  COVID-19 changes occurring within the NHS. This will allow for scenario-based service simulations  that evaluates the practice changes, current reduction in cancer patients and potential backlogs of  patients requiring RT and what it will mean for services and patients. Economic factors will be  included through integrating NHS tariff charges. Initial service data will be obtained through the  Christie NHS Foundation Trust's Big Data Radiotherapy project. MALTHUS is an active framework  model used nationally and internationally. MALTHUS is already collaborating with Greater  Manchester Cancer (part of the devolved health system) and the CRUK Radiotherapy Policy team.  We will work closely with the Christie to develop the service scenarios and collaborate with their  radiotherapy and lung cancer research projects, who are gathering COVID-19 RT activity and patient  outcome data. This will enable the investigation of wider health economic impacts of changes made  to current practice through using QALYs and cost-effectiveness analysis. The project will collaborate  with two additional cancer centres to trial scenario simulations. If successful, we will work with  national bodies (such as CTRad and RCR) to make the simulations available to all NHS radiotherapy  services.",10,10a
C00037,COVID-19: Improving the Evidence to Treat an Emerging Infection Through Observational Studies and a Randomized Trial,"The clinical management of COVID-19 remains unclear. First, we do not know what the disease is yet; we are still learning a great deal about what it causes in humans. We do not know what treatments to give, what risk factors are present for severe disease, and how long people are sick. We are proposing a national observational study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, with an embedded randomized clinical trial of an antiviral agent. The observational study will build on work that we have been doing for  the past four years, with pre-established protocols and data collection infrastructure just for this purpose. The randomized clinical trial will be with global collaborators to make sure that Canadian patients inform the world, and vice versa, about how to best treat this new disease. Alongside this, we will conduct surveys of clinicians, researchers, and the public about how they understand this new outbreak, how they feel about participating in research during a major outbreak, and what should be done differently; all of which will inform our clinical studies. Finally, we have been asked by the WHO to conduct a formal guideline for the management of COVID-19, which we will perform as data begins to emerge from the clinical trials that are ongoing. All of these proposals, put together, create a suite of approaches to better understanding and managing a new infection. Our team is large and diverse, and has been prepared for this outbreak for a number of years, and are ready to help Canadians respond in an evidence-informed way","4, 6","4b, 6h"
C20716,Network for Canadian Oral Health Research,"Oral health is a major contributor to the overall health and well-being of Canadians. Poor nutrition can result from tooth loss and decay, and a number of oral health ailments can seriously reduce one's overall health or worsen pre-existing conditions. This includes oral cancer, chronic orofacial pain, pulpitis (inflammation), or periodontitis (infection), among other conditions. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on factors that lead to disparities in oral health outcomes and access to preventative care, such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and disability. For nearly a decade, the Network for Canadian Oral Health Research (NCOHR) has proven its ability to initiate, support, and advance collaborative oral health research across the population. With a well-established infrastructure in place, the NCOHR is ready to advance oral health research and knowledge translation even further. Working together with scientists, healthcare providers, industry partners, government agents, and patients and communities, the NCOHR aims to spearhead new discoveries and strengthen existing models as they relate to the improvement and maintenance of good oral health. The NCOHR promotes excellence in oral health by training the next generation of researchers and clinicians with a strong dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion. As we improve the oral health of Canadians, we progress the global health of all. ",11,11a
C15232,Preclinical studies to establish the combination of apoA-I mimetic peptides and statins as novel therapy for COVID-19,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes the urgent need to determine pathways that can be targeted by novel  antivirals. This proposal describes the use of the combination of apoA-I mimetics with statins as novel therapy  for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes mitochondria to replicate in lung epithelial cells. Mitochondrial reactive  oxygen species (mito-ROS) induce alterations of lipids, membranes and redox sensitive proteins and ultimately  viral replication. Thus, we hypothesized that the antioxidant ApoA-I mimetic peptide 4F, that targets lipids,  mito-ROS and redox pathways, has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed that 4F not only has  antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 but also has anti-inflammatory effects in epithelial cells that may alleviate  lung injury in COVID-19. Importantly, prior studies have shown that 4F and statins may have major additive in  vivo effects on altered lipids, oxidative stress and inflammation that are instigators of cardiovascular disease.  Human studies suggest that statin use was associated with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19. Both  statins and 4F attenuate activation of the Toll like Receptor (TLR)-CD147-NF-κB pathways, which are key  inflammatory pathways in coronavirus infections. We hypothesize that the combination of 4F and statins has  antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells and anti-inflammatory activity in lung epithelial  cells, macrophages and vascular endothelial cells by attenuating the redox sensitive TLR-CD147-NF-κB  proviral and proinflammatory pathway. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal and using an air-liquid interface (ALI)  culture of primary airway epithelial cells, and cell lines in combination with viral and immune assays, we will  determine the mechanisms how the combination of 4F with atorvastatin attenuates aberrant activation of the  TLR-CD147-NF-κB pathway as a novel mechanism that drives viral replication and associated inflammatory  responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells. Given that vascular dysfunction is a possible mechanism of  chronic post-infectious sequalae of COVID-19, in Aim 2 of this proposal and using an established ex vivo  model of atherogenesis and vascular dysfunction and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from  COVID-19 patients in combination with immune assays, we will determine whether 4F and atorvastatin  attenuate aberrant activation of the TLR-CD147-NF-κB pathway in macrophages from COVID-19 patients that  interact ex vivo with endothelial cells to drive proinflammatory proatherogenic responses. Our independent  aims will complement each other and will advance the use of the combination of apoA-I mimetic peptides and  statins as novel therapy for COVID-19. This work is innovative, interdisciplinary, public health-oriented, and  directly addresses the goals of funding opportunity.","1, 6","1c, 6a, 6g"

P26311,Unraveling the role of IgA during respiratory virus infections,"IgA is the major type of antibody found in our lungs, and the second most prevalent antibody found in blood. Despite this, the role played by IgA in mediating protection against respiratory virus infections is poorly understood. IgA, like other antibodies, can protect against viral infections in two ways. First, IgA can neutralize virus and prevent it from entering host cells. In addition, IgA bound to virus and/or virus-infected cells can be recognized by specific receptors found of the surface of certain immune cells. Upon recognition, these immune cells become stimulated to eliminate virus and virally infected cells. Mice do not naturally express receptors that recognize IgA. This has been a major barrier to understanding how interactions between IgA and immune cells contribute to protection from viral infections. Using a new mouse model that expresses the human IgA receptor (CD89), we will determine the contribution of IgA to protection against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. These studies will critical information that will contribute to the development of new antibody-based therapeutics and better vaccines.",4,4b
C07119,DANA; A Tool to Detect Cognitive Changes in Pre-clinical and MCI Patients (Admin Supplement),"Project Summary/Abstract: The goals of this proposed project are to develop the DANA app into a tool that can be easily used remotely by COVID-19 patients after discharge from an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and to provide clinicians with meaningful data on the immediate and long term effects of COVID-19 on a patient's cognitive function. DANA will also help clinicians optimize neurocognitive rehabilitation. DANA is an FDA-cleared neurocognitive assessment tool that has been shown to be a valid and reliable method for screening cognitive functioning and tracking changes in cognitive functioning over time. Importantly, DANA can provide results virtually through a HIPAA-compliant portal, which will protect the clinician and others from exposure to the patient.    The specific aims of the proposal are:   (1) technical modifications and support of DANA for in-home self-administration and remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients, and   (2) deploy and show efficacious use of DANA with recovering COVID-19 patients.     These will build on the specific aims of the current Phase II SBIR, which includes the same longitudinal surveillance for participants either at-risk for Alzheimer's or diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).Three control populations, composed of   (1) hospitalized COVID-19 patients who do not require ICU admission,   (2) post-discharge ICU patients without COVID-19, and   (3) healthy participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Center Registry.     All participants will be given DANA immediately before leaving the hospital to determine a baseline, then they will administer the DANA tests to themselves while they convalesce in isolation.Technical changes specific to the needs of COVID-19 patients will be made to the DANA software in order to make DANA easier to use at home and provide optimal data to the clinician.",4,"4b, 4c, 4d"

C03136,"Understand the high pathogenicity and zoonotic transmission of the COVID-19 virus: evasion of host innate immune responses [Sex as a Biological Variable Supplement, COVID-19 Variant Supplement]","Coronaviruses are not new to humans. The human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were discovered as early as in the 1960s. Both viruses cause common cold, a mild infection of our upper respiratory tract. However, the story started to change in 2002 when SARS broke out in China and other countries. This outbreak was caused by a new coronavirus which originally came from bats. Most importantly, this SARS coronavirus is highly pathogenic, with a fatality as high as 10%. Ten years later, a more deadly coronavirus caused the MERS outbreak. Now, a new coronavirus came back, is raging in China, may cause a global pandemic if not controlled. This new virus, COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2), has infected more and killed more than the total number by both SARS and MERS. Two urgent questions need to be addressed.   - How did these coronaviruses transmit from animals into humans?   - What have made them so pathogenic and lethal?     Humans are protected from viral diseases by the immune system. These pathogenic coronaviruses must have found ways to evade the immune responses so that they can spread in humans and cause fatal illness. We thus propose this research to elucidate how this COVID-19 virus does this. The findings will identify the key viral genes that suppress immune responses by blocking essential signaling pathways. Our results will open new avenues for the development of effective interventions to halt the COVID-19 break.",1,"1b, 1d"
C15341,Addressing vaccine hesitancy in Baltimore City through a youth engagement/health literacy STEM initiative,"Project Summary/Abstract  University of Maryland (UMB) CURE Connections (C2) is an integral component of a minority STEM education  pipeline in which West Baltimore high school students gain STEM enrichment including hands-on research and  community outreach through a network of minority-focused college programs at UMB and its partner institutions.  For this project, we will expand upon our current C2 curriculum by adapting, implementing, and evaluating a  youth-engagement/health literacy strategy to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine  uptake. Central to our aims is a new capacity-building partnership with the University of Maryland Center for  Vaccine Development (CVD), a nationally recognized leader in vaccine research that has been at the forefront  of COVID-19 vaccine development and testing. We will integrate CVD expertise and resources into our  established network of community, medical center, and local government sectors partners. CVD partners will  support the adaptation of the Wellness Champions for Change-Student (WCC-S) curriculum to address COVID-  19, vaccine science, and promotion of vaccine uptake. This curriculum originally focused on obesity prevention  and was developed and tested at UMB as a model for health promotion via youth advocacy/health literacy. This  new vaccine-focused curriculum will be implemented during our 6-week intensive summer programming with C2  high school scholars. C2 scholars will then work with CVD faculty/students and UMB community partners to  disseminate vaccine education in West Baltimore communities. In this proposal, we will use the adaptation  framework, FRAME, to develop modifications to the curriculum to focus on vaccine hesitancy and access.  Specifically, we aim to: (1) Adapt a youth advocacy/health literacy curriculum originally developed for obesity  prevention using the FRAME adaptation framework to tailor content to address vaccine hesitancy as a strategy  to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among West Baltimore residents. This curriculum will align with Next  Generation Science Standards to provide foundational knowledge required to understand and translate concepts  related to vaccine science and teach skills focused on health literacy promotion, youth advocacy, and community  engaged research that culminates with a scholar-driven community project to reduce vaccine hesitancy. (2)  Implement and evaluate the adapted curricula with a cohort of C2 scholar high school students via a 6-week  summer program. The C2 scholars are the cornerstone of this proposal and function as credible conduits for  dissemination of vaccine education from UMB to the West Baltimore communities in which they reside. The  success of this program will demonstrate the feasibility of cross-sector partnerships and their potential to help  erode structural racism that is at the heart of vaccine hesitancy and access disparities. Program adaptations to  address vaccine uptake provide a model for its application to address future public health issues thereby creating  a sustainable, community-focused infrastructure for public health promotion.",9,"9b, 9c, 9d"
C20753,A longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and molecular characterisation of variants in immunocompromised individuals with persistent infection,"Immunocompromised individuals can develop persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Mutations accrue due to ongoing replication, creating new 'variants' of the virus. These mutations have the potential to alter host-pathogen interaction, potentially affecting pathogenesis, transmissibility, severity of disease and susceptibility to vaccines or treatment.  This longitudinal study will characterise viral evolution and the variants that arise during persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2, followed by molecular characterisation of these variants in vitro. By studying longitudinal viral isolates and sera from the same individual, sequential mutations can be studied to judge their effect on host-pathogen interaction.    The aims of this proposal include to 1) describe the patterns of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost evolution longitudinally during persistent infection, 2) correlate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with clinical course, immunosuppression and antiviral treatment, 3) characterise emergent variants in vitro, including experiments to judge neutralisation by antibodies and resistance to interferon.    Genomic sequencing of viral isolates using a deep sequencing protocol on Illumina technology will allow determination of the consensus genome and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). The presence and frequency of iSNVs over time will be monitored, and in response to treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and other immunomodulating therapies for pre-existing conditions.    Viral isolates will be cultured for in vitro molecular characterisation experiments. Successive genomic mutations will be judged for their effect on neutralisation by antibodies and changes in susceptibility of the virus to interferon. Longitudinal serum samples from persistently infected individuals will be used in autologous neutralisation studies on the cultured virus.    Initial research utilises existing ethical approval to analyse already stored, residual samples from GSTT in collaboration with KCL and UCL.","1, 4","1d, 4b"
P21782,Understanding the Molecular Determinants of Reassortment in Orthobunyaviruses and Phleboviruses.,"Project Summary/Abstract   Genome reassortment drives the diversity we see in segmented RNA viruses. Unlike recombination,  intact genes are readily exchanged between two co-infecting viruses, resulting in their rapid evolution.  Reassortment amongst influenza viruses is a well-established driver of host range and virulence. Though  reassortment occurs frequently amongst bunyaviruses and can result in highly virulent reassortants such as  Ngari virus, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Understanding how these viruses reassort and modify  virulence will allow us to predict potential virus emergence or modulations in host range allowing potential species  jumps. The goal of this project is to investigate the molecular determinants of reassortment and virulence  amongst orthobunyaviruses and phleboviruses. These are tri-segmented negative sense RNA viruses with Small  (S), Medium (M) and Large (L) segments encoding the nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins GnGc and a viral  polymerase (L protein), respectively. Some viruses also encode nonstructural proteins on the S and/or M  segments. Aim 1, will investigate segment compatibility amongst the priority pathogens Severe fever with  thrombocytopenia syndrome virus and Heartland virus, using a forward and reverse genetics approach. Aim 2,  will investigate homologous and heterologous segment dynamics within infected cells. Aim 3, will investigate the  virulence of natural reassortants of Oropouche virus and potential reassortants of SFTSV and HRTV. These  studies are of significant importance, as only by understanding the fundamental aspects of the biology of these  viruses will we be able to understand the molecular determinants of their reassortment. This proposal will support  my long-term career goal of understanding novel virus emergence and evolution. My mentorship team consists  of Professor Paul Duprex, an expert in paramyxoviruses and cross-species viral transmission, Dr. Anita McElroy,  an expert in Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission and immunology, Dr. Amy Hartman, an expert in RVFV  pathogenesis in rats and monkeys and Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an expert in influenza virus biology and  reassortment. With the support of strong mentors and collaborators I will receive training in the skills required to  complete the proposed aims. Upon completion of the K99 phase I will be in a strong position to pursue an  independent and successful research position contributing to the bunyavirus field.",1,1b

C09522,SCENTinel: A Rapid Smell Test for COVID-19 Surveillance,"PROJECT SUMMARYSmell loss is a predominant symptom of COVID-19, and initial evidence based on self-reports suggests thatchemosensory loss is a sensitive predictor of COVID-19 in the general population, more so than fever.However, given the natural lack of awareness of chemosensory changes, self-reports underestimate the trueprevalence of smell loss in patients with COVID-19 by 20% compared to an objective test. Therefore, wepropose testing and deploying a rapid and objective measure of smell ability, the SCENTinel test, inspired bythe NIH Toolbox® Odor Identification Test that our team previously developed. SCENTinel is an inexpensive,and convenient smell test for COVID-19 surveillance of the population that quickly and easily assessesthree smell loss factors: odor detection, odor intensity, and odor identification. It is designed for practical use inseveral contexts, including high-density areas such as community medical sites, universities, subacute carefacilities, and both industrial and nonindustrial workplaces. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise inunderstanding taste and smell, developing and validating chemosensory tests, as well as studying the broadsymptomatology of COVID-19. The group is led by MPI Dalton from the Monell Chemical Senses Center, anexpert in human olfaction and designing olfactory tests; MPI Parma from Temple University is an expert inCOVID-19 smell loss, is the Chair of the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research, and has expertise inconducting research in rapidly changing situations; Dr. Schalet and his team at Northwestern University andDr. Chun and his team at Yale University, among the other established and interested partners (Fox subacutenursing homes, Hormel Food). Our team also includes the Director of Technology Transfer at the MonellCenter, Dr. O'Leary, to explore potential partners and expand SCENTinel deployment nationwide. Dr. Reedfrom the Monell Chemical Senses Center will work directly with the Data Coordination Center, drawing on herexperience in managing large shared NIH datasets. All will work closely with the NIH Project Scientist. Thisproposal aims to a) fine-tune SCENTinel's ability to predict a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test; b) examine marginal smell loss as a sign of the earliest phases of COVID-19, before a positive diagnostic test; and c)assess the test's psychometric validity with test-retest reliability measures and validation against the NIHToolbox® Odor Identification Test. Together, these aims will establish a standardized protocol for use ofSCENTinel as a rapid and objective smell test that can easily be incorporated into onsite COVID-19 testingcenters, schools, and workplaces nationwide. Furthermore, it will provide key insights into early-onsetchemosensory symptoms in relation to a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, providing a crucially needed meansto contain the spread of COVID-19.",1,1a
C09584,Keeping rural minority 'essential' workplaces open safely during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for miners,"ABSTRACTThere are limited studies on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rural essential workers. This gap-in-knowledge mustbe addressed to develop and implement novel pandemic strategies to keep open rural essential workplaces, such as coalmines. The long-term goal of the study is to mitigate the spread of the pandemic in miners, a population of high-risk, ruralessential workers who are susceptible and vulnerable to COVID-19, and who are predominantly racial/ethnic minorities inNew Mexico (NM). The study objective is to provide proof-of-principle for frequent point-of-care molecular testing as aworkplace surveillance tool to monitor and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this unique population. Thecentral hypothesis is that frequent workplace molecular surveillance is an effective method to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectionand discover novel host risk factors. The site of molecular surveillance (intervention site) will be a surface mine in McKinleyCounty, NM, located just outside the Navajo Nation, comprised of 66% minority miners. Miners at the intervention site willprovide nasal swabs every alternate work shift, which will be analyzed with the Abbott ID Now™ COVID-19 test, i.e., the'index' test. The control mine located at Campbell County, Wyoming, has similar mine characteristics as the interventionmine. The rationale for this study is to establish the suitability of longitudinal molecular surveillance to prevent and controlSARS-CoV-2 infection in this unique population by completing the following aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine theacceptance rate to frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance among miners. Hypothesis 1: Miners will havea cumulative acceptance rate of frequent testing at ≥85%, with the added objective of exploring difference in acceptance byminer characteristics. Specific Aim 2: To determine the ability to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by point-of-caremolecular workplace surveillance in a real-world setting of miners. Hypothesis 2: The sensitivity of the index test in a real-world study setting is a) comparable to that described by others in controlled settings, and b) positively associated with viralload in upper respiratory specimens. Specific Aim 3: To determine the effectiveness and implementation costs of frequentpoint-of-care molecular workplace surveillance on reducing incident infection rates of SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis 3A:Frequent point-of-care molecular testing over six months in the intervention mine will result in lower incident seropositivityrates compared to the control mine. Hypothesis 3B: Frequent point-of-care molecular surveillance in the intervention mineis cost-effective compared to the control mine. Specific Aim 4: To determine novel predictive host factors associated withincident SARS-CoV-2 infection in miners. Hypothesis 4: Miners with incident infection demonstrate less frequent use ofcloth face coverings outside the workplace, greater mine dust exposure intensity, presence of dust-related lung disease, andracial/ethnic minority status than those not infected. Successful completion of the study will establish the acceptability andeffectiveness of the proposed surveillance in work settings where common occupational mitigation strategies are notpossible. Findings from this study will provide broad-reaching implications for novel pandemic strategies to keep ruralessential workplaces open. By working with the NIH RADx-UP Coordinating and Data Collection Center, this study willprovide crucial data for subsequent studies of vaccine interventions in rural minority essential workers.","3, 5, 9","3a, 5b, 9a"

P21779,Identification of Small Molecular Inhibitors of Rift Valley Fever Virus Replication,"Project Summary   Rift Valley fever caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an acute, mosquito-borne, fever-causing  zoonotic disease that affects both humans and animals. Large Rift Valley fever outbreaks have occurred  throughout Africa and more recently in the Arabian Peninsula. Because RVFV is no longer restricted to African  countries, it has raised concerns that the disease could spread worldwide. The RVFV is a select agent that  requires high biocontainment facilities. This limitation has hampered the development of RVFV antivirals and  vaccines. Despite the significant impact of the disease to the economy and public health, there are no fully  licensed vaccine and antivirals available in the US for human and animal use. It is urgent to identify and develop  effective inhibitors against RVFV to treat exposed and infected humans and animals.   Dr. MaÃ¢Â€Â™s group has developed a cell-based screening assay based on the RVFV MP12 vaccine strain that  expresses Renilla Luciferase using Renilla as readout to identify RVFV inhibitors, and established a STAT1-KO  mouse model susceptible to infection with MP12 vaccine strain that can be used in a BSL-2 facility. Furthermore,  they have screened 727 compounds from the NIH collections of which two candidates including 6-azauridine  and mitoxantrone inhibited replication of MP12. They hypothesize that effective inhibitors against RVFV can be  identified by screening large compound collections and by further optimization of their structures and activities,  and the mechanisms of inhibitory effects of identified candidates can be determined. Thus, they plan to use the  developed high-throughput assay to identify inhibitors against RVFV, evaluate their efficacy in vitro and in mice,  and understand the underlying mechanisms of inhibitory effects of identified candidates through two specific  aims in this R21 proposal. In specific aim 1, the libraries assembled by the University of Kansas High Throughput  Screening Laboratory that contain approximately 26,000 chemical compounds will be screened. The 26,000  compounds are predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier. Hits from the library will help overcome the challenge  for RVFV antivirals to reach the brain through the blood-brain barrier to protect encephalitis. Primary hits will be  confirmed by in vitro and in vivo assays. In specific aim 2, 6-azauridine and mitoxantrone as well as others  identified in Aim 1 will be evaluated in vitro and in the BALB/c mice using virulent RVFV. To understand the  underlying mechanisms of their inhibitory effects, whether the compounds block virus entry, inhibit virus  replication and polymerase activity will be investigated using different designed assays. The results of this study  could identify novel effective inhibitors against RVFV and understand the underlying mechanisms of their  inhibitory effects, and offer novel insights toward the design of novel antiviral drugs against this zoonotic disease  that will benefit both human and animal health.",6,6a

Secondly, alleviating social isolation and loneliness in care homes by providing creative activities that support wellbeing for people with dementia, especially, in the context of long-term CV-19 lockdown and restrictions.      This project will produce, distribute and evaluate CV-19 culture boxes incorporating pandemic guidance with creative activities to support health and wellbeing and alleviate social isolation and loneliness for people with dementia in care homes.     The team will work with the Geller Institute of Ageing and Memory (IAM), stakeholders including people with dementia, staff and family carers and allied professionals, including BAME representatives, to co-design culture boxes with artists. These will be delivered weekly for 3 months (then repeated, updated, for 12 months). Each will contain multisensory materials (subject to health and safety guidance) suitable for diverse populations that: provide information about CV-19 transmission and prevention, with creative resources including music and art activities that are simple to implement and offer stimulation and enrichment. The weekly delivery aims to reinforce public health messaging and to mimic regular activities in care homes.     The National Activity Providers Association (NAPA) will support distribution via their network of 3000 members. The project will be evaluated using Participatory Action Research (PAR). All resources will be archived via the NAPA website ensuring that they are widely available. Dissemination includes an art exhibition, conferences, educational presentations, and a peer-reviewed paper.","9, 10","9a, 9c, 10a"
P23449,PROposing Action to ConTrol and Impede betacoronaVirus Emergencies,"The COVID-19 pandemic caught the world unprepared. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), developed in record time, mitigated the health and economic damages, however our reaction has always been one step behind the virus evolution, and emerging variants repeatedly escaped our interventions. The omicron variant escaped humoral immunity generated by most vaccines and mAbs by mutating immunodominant epitopes. The extremely potent mAb developed by our laboratory also lost potency against omicron. 'ÄØHere we propose to develop vaccines and monoclonals neutralizing existing and future variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, by targeting immunologically subdominant regions which are less susceptible to antigenic variation. We will isolate mAbs from individuals who had infection and multiple vaccinations, whose repertoire is enriched in B cells encoding broadly neutralizing antibodies, to build a map of the broadly shared epitopes. Structural prediction and clustering of the immune repertoire through deep neural networks will be used to improve the breadth of coverage of the mAbs. The Monte Carlo-based sequence design of Rosetta and free energy perturbation calculations will be used to in-silico 'Äúdesign protein-binding proteins'Äù and identify newly designed immunogens which can be loaded on nanoparticles and used as vaccines. This approach will provide broadly protective mAbs and vaccines proactively designed to neutralize all variants of SARS-CoV-2 and new coronaviruses that are very likely to jump from animals to humans in the future. If successful, the approach to map subdominant epitopes and use of genomic and structural information to design mAbs and vaccines targeting subdominant, broadly conserved epitopes, will pave the way to approach other pathogens with high antigenic variability such as influenza and HIV viruses, Plasmodium spp. and antibiotic resistant bacteria. This will strongly increase European competitiveness in fighting infections.","6, 7","6a, 7a"
C15142,COVID19: Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the association of humoral immune responses with clinical outcomes in veterans and employees in the Cleveland VA Medical Center,"The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is placing urgent demands on health care workers and researchers.  Between April 3rd and May 1st global cases of COVID19 nearly tripled from approximately 1 million to over 3  million. With the possibility of a reemergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the fall, rapid specific antibody assays are  essential. This application proposes to investigate the humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in veterans  and employees at the Cleveland VA Medical Center. The proposal has three aims. Aim 1) To develop rapid,  high throughput assays to measure total and functional antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in COVID19  infected individuals. In aim 1, we will establish a magnet bead-based assay that can detect antibody (Ab)  responses to up to 50 different epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 in one serum sample. This assay will also be able to  detect Abs that interfere with the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-  CoV-2 to its receptor, ACE2. Antibodies that can block binding between the RBD and ACE2 on lung epithelial  cells will prevent viral entry and will likely be neutralizing. Aim 2) To determine if robust humoral immunity and  higher neutralizing Ab titers protect VA health care employees from clinical COVID19 compared to their  colleagues with low or no SAR2-CoV-2 specific antibodies. In aim 2 we will use a rapid antibody test to screen  Cleveland VA health care employees at high-risk for infection with COVID19 (first responders, emergency  department staff, intensive care unit staff, COVID19 ward staff). We will ask for a serum sample from those  that are Ab positive for COVID19 to examine the SARS-CoV-2 Ab response in more depth. We will examine  general Ab titers, neutralizing Ab titers, and antibody isotypes. If there is a resurgence of COVID19 in the fall,  we will determine if those health care employees with a robust humoral response are better protected from re-  infection than those employees who had a weak or no Ab response. Aim 3) To examine the association of  COVID19-induced lymphopenia with the ability to generate a humoral immune response. Older age, SARS-  CoV-1 and SARS-COV-2 infection are all associated with a decrease of white blood cells or lymphopenia. In  aim 3 we will examine the effect of lymphopenia on the development of the humoral Ab response to COVID19.  We expect that those individuals with severe lymphopenia will have few T follicular helper cells in their lymph  nodes and this will lead to poor Ab affinity maturation, isotype switching, and B cell memory development. In  summary, results from this project will provide a rapid SARS-CoV-2 specific serum assay able to detect  neutralizing Ab that can be used to screen VA healthcare workers for exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We will  investigate the humoral antibody responses of high-risk health care employees that were infected with  COVID19 and try to determine what constitutes protection from re-infection if there is a resurgence of  COVID19 in the fall. Lastly, we will gain an understanding of the B cell affinity maturation, isotype switching  and generation of B cell memory and neutralizing Ab titers and determine how lymphopenia may play a role in  the dysfunction of humoral immunity to COVID19. This knowledge will aid in development of better treatment  and future vaccines.",1,"1a, 1d"
C06112,"Interrogating COVID-19, the lung microbiota, and therapeutic phages to mitigate secondary lung infection and inflammation (COVPHA)","The Coronavirus 2019-nCoV pandemic poses a heavy burden on both society and the healthcare system. Similar to other respiratory viruses, the rate of infection with acute bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients is estimated to be up to 16%.     To understand the mechanisms of secondary and co-infection in COVID-19 patients and to develop phage-based therapeutics against the associated bacterial pneumonia, we propose COVPHA, which benefits from our recent advances in high-throughput, culture-independent, but host-targeted methods.     COVPHA aims to design a whole battery of phage-based therapies that apply multifaceted modes of action against bacterial secondary and coinfections associated with COVID-19 infection. Using an interdisciplinary approach, COVPHA will systematically identify the co-infecting bacteria in COVID19 patients by metagenomics (WP1), and isolate effective phages against target multi-resistant bacteria, using a revolutionary targeted culture-independent method, viral-tagging (WP2).     We will determine the efficacy of different phage cocktails against target bacteria (WP 3), via our high-throughput in vitro system. Using tissue culture and in vivo animal models, we will comprehensively investigate the safety and efficacy of selected single phages and phage cocktails against target bacteria (WP4), to lay the foundation for compassionate use and an early clinical trial (WP5).","4, 6","4b, 6a"
P25533,"""The isolation I feel is profound"": The iParent2Parent Online Peer Support Program for parents of pediatric solid organ transplantation recipients","Parents of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients experience heightened levels of distress, anxiety and depression. These mental health concerns, along with increased feelings of isolation and decreased access to social support, have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial interventions, such as evidence-based peer support, improve parental mental health by fostering a sense of self-worth and reducing feelings of loneliness, which ultimately positively impacts their child's well-being. The iParent2Parent (iP2P) program is a new, innovative virtual peer mentorship program that will offer vital support to parents of pediatric SOT recipients. The program is informed by the established iPeer2Peer program for teens, which has improved coping and self-management skills in chronic illness patient populations. This proposed study to adapt the iPeer2Peer program to the iP2P program for parents is critical, as parents have emotional, appraisal and informational support needs that are distinct from teens. This research aims to (1) determine whether the iP2P program is feasible, and (2) explore the impact of the iP2P program on psychosocial outcomes, using a mixed methods pilot feasibility waitlist randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Parents of children who received a SOT at The Hospital for Sick Children will be invited to participate as peer mentors and mentees (randomized into the iP2P or control group). This timely study will gather essential information on (1) feasibility outcomes, and (2) preliminary psychosocial outcomes to inform a future definitive multi-centre RCT. Given the rapid health system reform necessitated by the pandemic, the time to adopt virtual approaches is now. There is a crucial need to pilot and evaluate the iP2P program - an intervention that offers critical parent peer support in pediatric SOT - to address persistent poor mental health outcomes that would otherwise endure without this important research.","4, 10","4e, 10a"

C06746,2) MVA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"The overall goal of this proposal is to develop effective prophylactic vaccines against the novel SARSCoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that has recently emerged as a pandemic across the world. The SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 120,000 people and over 4000 people died due to COVID-19, a diseasecaused by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a vaccine that can rapidly induceanti-viral immunity and prevent infection. Previous data from other related coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV demonstrate that a strong neutralizing antibody response against the spike protein caneffectively prevent infection. Thus, a primary goal of this proposal is to develop a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)based vaccine that expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to generate a rapid and strong neutralizing antibodyresponse both in systemic and mucosal compartments. There are several advantages to MVA based vaccinesthat include their excellent safety and a single dose of MVA vaccination can provide protection against multiplevirus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS, Zika and Ebola virus. A novel aspect of this proposal is that wewill compare the immunogenicity and protective ability of different forms of the spike protein with a goal ofinducing neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. This proposal has two specific aims.The goal of Aim 1 is to generate MVA vaccines and characterizing the anti-spike antibody response in mice. Wewill also compare parenteral (i.m.) vs mucosal (intranasal) vaccinations to determine the best route for inducingmucosal antibody response. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the protective efficacy of the MVA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop and characterize small animal models forevaluating vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Mice have served as an excellent model system to not onlyunderstand immunity to the related SARS virus but also for evaluating vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. In thisAim, we will develop and characterize a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and use this model to test theprotective efficacy of our MVA-based vaccine candidates. The completion of these studies will not only providea mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection but also develop vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","1, 7","1e, 7a, 7i"
P21681,Large-scale compatibility assessments between ACE2 proteins and diverse sarbecovirus spikes,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Viral spillover from animal reservoirs into humans can decimate public health systems and cripple the  world economy, as evident with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Continued wildlife habitat destruction,  human expansion, and routine global travel keep increasing the likelihood that another viral pandemic will  occur again within the next few decades. Beta coronaviruses are an incredibly diverse family of viruses  observed across Asia, Europe, and Africa, that have proven capable of zoonotic spillover into humans as they  have caused multiple worldwide outbreaks over the last two decades. We still lack the fundamental  understanding of the molecular and genetic factors that dictate the molecular compatibilities that determine  which beta coronaviruses are most likely to jump into humans in the future.   The ability of SARS-like beta coronaviruses to utilize ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry is a major factor  determining the extent of coronavirus tropism across species or within the tissues of an organism. While  SARS-CoV-2 has been heavily studied, almost nothing is known about most other members of this virus  family. Traditional studies can only test a handful of conditions at a time, incompletely sampling the vast range  of relevant experimental conditions, particularly for the hundreds of uncharacterized beta coronaviruses. Large-  scale, minimally-biased, cell-based entry assays are needed to model how these factors converge to dictate  the probability of infection.   We will pair new methods in cell engineering and synthetic biology with DNA-sequencing enabled  multiplex genetic assays to perform a series of large-scale infection assays revealing the factors determining  susceptibility to beta coronavirus entry. These large-scale experiments will reveal how ACE2 sequence and  cell surface density impact the efficiency of virus entry. By testing a library of receptor binding domain  sequences identified from ecological surveillance of bat coronaviruses, we will identify which viruses possess  sufficient affinity to human ACE2 to potentiate cross-species transmission, and create a catalog describing all  of the different ways these viruses have evolved their sequences to engage ACE2. By modeling the  relationship between spike and ACE2 protein sequence, expression level, and efficiency of cell entry, we will  identify potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like bat coronaviruses, and predict which  viruses have sufficient binding with human ACE2 to potentially spark the next pandemic.","1, 2","1b, 2a, 2b"
C00149,"COVID-19: The Role of Psychological Factors in the Spreading of Disease, Discrimination, and Distress","The novel corona COVID-19 arose in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread from China to other parts of the world. By early February there were over 40,000 confirmed cases in 25 countries, of which 2.5% have been fatal. The WHO declared the virus to be a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 is poised to become the next pandemic. For both epidemics and pandemics, psychological factors play a major role in the spread and containment of infection (e.g., non-adherence with hygiene guidelines) and in societally disruptive behaviour (e.g., infection-related discrimination, excessive fear and worry, overuse of healthcare resources); as such, psychological factors have important public health significance. The proposed studies are the first of a planned series of studies with the end goal of developing a rapid assessment system (assessment battery and online delivery platform) that can be used to assess, for any pandemic or major epidemic, infection-related excessive anxiety and xenophobia, and risk factors for these problems. To achieve this end goal, we will conduct three studies with a specific focus on COVID-19 using community samples. The goal of Study 1 will be to develop and validate measures of COVID-19-related anxiety and xenophobia (C-ANX, and C-XEN). In Study 2, these scales will be used to identify the correlates of C-ANX and C-XEN, which can then be used to identify the downstream impacts of these psychological reactions. Based on the findings of Studies 1 and 2, we will develop and evaluate an online public health assessment and information platform (Study 3) designed to reduce the risk of adverse psychological reactions to infectious outbreak. This platform would then be expanded to (a) monitor the psychological impact (as a public health problem) of a pandemic/epidemic, (b) identify people in need of psychological services, and (c) implement interventions for reducing infection-related xenophobia and excessive anxiety.",10,10a
P23217,"Creating high-resolution, epitope-focused vaccines","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT   The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to establish a novel method for  creating vaccines. These vaccines will lead to a highly focused antibody response toward  particular epitopes that are known to be the targets of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs). If successful, this approach could be applied broadly for the creation of important, new  vaccines that protect against infectious disease.   The ability to focus the antibody response toward particular epitopes would permit  vaccines to be created that elicit neutralizing antibodies, instead of non-neutralizing antibodies.  It would also permit creation of vaccines that lead to an antibody response directed against  highly conserved regions of an infectious agent, leading to broad spectrum protection against  different strains and minimizing the possibility of Ã¢Â€ÂœescapeÃ¢Â€Â by mutant variants.   The key starting material for the approach is a mAb that is broadly neutralizing against  the infectious agent. In recent decades, many potent, broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnAbs) have  been isolated and characterized in detail. Some of these bnAbs (for example, that target  influenza virus, Ebola virus and HIV-1) have entered clinical trials to test their efficacy in treating  infectious disease and/or to determine whether passively infused mAb can prevent infection.  Despite major research funding, however, it has generally not been possible to create vaccines  that are capable of eliciting antibodies with properties such as these bnAbs.   Here, a simple but radically different approach for creating epitope-focused vaccine  candidates is utilized that leverages a tool that has been available all along Ã¢Â€Â"" the mAb itself.  First, binding of the mAb is used to protect the target epitope. Next the surface of the remainder  of the antigen is modified to render it non-immunogenic. Finally, the protecting mAb is removed,  thereby deprotecting and exposing the unmodified, target epitope. The method is called protect,  modify, deprotect (or PMD). Ultimately, this high-risk, high-reward proposal could enable  creation of vaccines that elicit an antibody response against any given mAb epitope, and only  that epitope.",7,7i
C07068,Role of Intestinal Barrier Integrity in Modulating the Host Glycome During COVID-19,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Hyper-inflammation and complement activation have been implicated in Coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and outcomes; however, the pathophysiological mechanismsunderlying these phenomena remain unknown. SARS-CoV2 infects gut cells, and viral infections in the gutcauses changes in gut structure and breakdown of the epithelial barrier, which can increase permeability to gutmicrobes and microbial products. This microbial translocation has a direct impact on systemic inflammation, butit may also indirectly impact it by modulating circulating glycomes. Recently, it has been shown that viral-infections-mediated alterations to glycans, in particular loss of sialic acid and loss of galactose, on circulatingglycoproteins and antibodies (IgG and IgA) mediate and drive inflammation and complement activation. Gutmicrobial translocation is a potential source of glycomic alterations during viral infections. Translocation ofglycan-degrading enzymes (such as sialidase and galactosidases) released by several members of the gutmicrobiome can efficiently alter circulating glycomes, leading to the exacerbation of inflammation. In ourpreliminary data, we found that levels of several gut bacteria genera correlate with plasma IgG glycosylationduring viral infection. We also found that these pro-inflammatory glycans on IgG correlate with both markers ofmicrobial translocation, as well as with markers of systemic inflammation. These data suggest a link betweenmicrobial dysbiosis, microbial translocation, circulating glycomes, and systemic inflammation during viralinfections. However, the role of circulating glycomes in regulating inflammation during COVID-19 has never beeninvestigated. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose to test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 impairs intestinalbarrier integrity leading to translocation of microbial products that alter circulating glycomes, whichimpact COVID-19 pathogenesis and outcomes. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 isassociated with disrupted intestinal barrier integrity and dysregulated circulating glycomes. 1.a) We will compareplasma markers of mucosal structural integrity, bacterial translocation, and microbial metabolites of 120 COVID-19 patients (with varying disease outcomes); and 120 controls (matched for age, gender, and ethnicity). 1.b) Wewill compare the glycomic profiles of total plasma, plasma IgG, and plasma IgA of the 120 COVID-19 patientsand controls. 1.c) We will test if levels of plasma markers of mucosal structural integrity and bacterialtranslocation associate with the glycosylation of plasma, plasma IgG, and plasma IgA. In Aim 2, we will test thehypothesis that circulating hyposialylated and agalactosylated glycomic signatures are linked to higherinflammation, higher immune activation, and worse clinical outcomes during COVID-19. This supplement canadvance our knowledge of the microbial and glycomic underpinnings of COVID-19, which can serve as 1) novelbiomarkers for disease risk stratification, disease course, and therapeutic response (to be used immediatelyupon validation); and 2) a foundation to develop innovative therapeutics in the future.",4,"4a, 4b"
P21397,Optimising genomic RNA RNA interactions for development of flexible influenza virus vector backbones for co vaccination,"The Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), marketed as FluMist/Fluenz by AstraZeneca forms the backbone of the United Kingdom's childhood influenza vaccination programme and is given as a nasal spray annually to all 2-12 year-olds. Unlike inactivated vaccines, LAIVs are unique in generating significant mucosal immunity (Barria et al., J Infect Dis, 2013), offering the possibility of pre-empting virus spread from the upper to lower respiratory tract and consequent risk of severe disease.    In the 2013-14 and 2015-16 influenza seasons, low vaccine effectiveness was observed for the H1N1 component of FluMist in the USA, attributed to decreased LAIV replication in human nasal epithelial cells (Hawksworth et al., Vaccine, 2020), rather than decreased HA antigen stability (Parker et al., Vaccine 2019). One potential contributing factor to this reduced fitness was a decrease in the production of infectious virus particles carrying all eight genome segments. Observations also suggest that the ability of the historic MDV genome to incorporate HA and NA genes from different, contemporary influenza A viruses can vary, resulting in LAIV strains with unexpected replicative differences.    This project aims to understand how the genome segments of LAIVs are assembled in order to bioengineer a next-generation of LAIVs suitable as flexible vectors for all seasonal or pandemic influenza strains and co-vaccination against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 - to which we have no vaccine that confers mucosal immunity. Such a vaccine would be invaluable, since existing vaccines are largely ineffective at halting transmission.    This project aims to (1) map RNA:RNA interactions that drive assembly of LAIV strains and (2) to use this knowledge to engineer a flexible MDV backbone enabling efficient generation of either seasonal or pandemic LAIV, that (3) can also act as a flexible platform for co-vaccination of influenza along with other respiratory pathogens.","1, 7","1c, 1d, 7a, 7i, 7l"
P21757,Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 to treat MERS-CoV and related emerging CoV,"Project Summary  Zoonotic viruses, like filoviruses and coronaviruses (CoV), represent a continuous and growing threat to global  public health because they unpredictably emerge causing devastating outbreaks of pandemic disease. In the  21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory  syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools of viruses, causing severe disease in  humans. MERS-CoV is endemic in camels in the Middle East with continuous new infections in humans.  Although SARS-CoV is not currently a threat, several Ã¢Â€ÂœprepandemicÃ¢Â€Â SARS-like CoVs have been isolated from  bats that replicate efficiently in human cells and are resistant to existing therapies. With the unpredictable  overlap of human and wild animal ecologies, the potential for novel CoV emergence into humans is highly  probable. Currently, there are no approved antiviral therapies for any human CoV infection. Broad-spectrum  CoV therapies that control known human and zoonotic CoV infections would address an immediate unmet  medical need and could counter future pandemic episodes. In partnership with Gilead Sciences, we have  demonstrated that the nucleoside prodrug, GS-5734, is highly efficacious in inhibiting multiple human and  zoonotic CoV in vitro and SARS-CoV in vivo. The primary goal of our program is to accelerate the preclinical  development of GS-5734 and promote IND licensure for the MERS-CoV indication. To thoroughly evaluate the  breadth of antiviral activity and predict efficacy against future emerging CoV, we will also assess efficacy  against a panel of CoV representative of family-wide genetic diversity, including prepandemic zoonotic strains  poised for emergence. Focusing on the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, our unique partnership integrates: i)  metagenomics and recombinant virus synthetic genome recovery, ii) primary human lung cell models, iii)  cutting edge virology and biochemistry, iv) robust murine and primate models of human disease and v) state of  the art metabolic and pharmacokinetic analysis. In Aim 1, we refine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  and breadth of GS-5734 through efficacy and metabolism studies in various primary human cells with a diverse  array of human and zoonotic CoV and through the evaluation of in vivo efficacy in murine and non-human  primate models of MERS- and SARS-CoV. In Aim 2, we select for resistance against SARS-CoV and MERS-  CoV, and determine the effect of resistance on virus replication, fitness and susceptibility to treatment. In Aim  3, we determine if the mechanism of action of GS-5734 is a result of direct effects on viral RNA replication  and/or alteration of antiviral immunity via deep sequencing and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ  hybridization of vehicle or drug treated infected cells and mice. We articulate a development strategy for broad-  spectrum therapeutics that could be extended to a multitude of emerging viral pathogens threatening global  public health.",6,6a
P23590,Phototherapy treatment for long-term COVID-19 patients,"As the number of COVID-19 cases grows worldwide, so does the number of those suffering from clinical parameters that last weeks to-months post initial recovery, termed long-COVID, with as much as 36.55% of survivors exhibiting long-lasting symptoms (e.g., weight loss, chest pain, cognitive and memory disorders, breathlessness) according to recent studies'Äîan estimated ~157 million long-COVID adult patients worldwide to date. Clearly, this growing health problem represents a modern global medical challenge. This challenge is compounded by a knowledge gap regarding the causes and prevalence of long-COVID, leaving no effective treatments. As noted by The Lancet: 'ÄúThe scientific and medical communities must collaborate 'Ä¶ and find effective treatments'Äù. Based on findings from my ERC grant, supported by other COVID-related reports, I propose to validate a UVB radiation (phototherapy) protocol for the treatment of long-COVID patients. Our findings indicate that phototherapy induces an immunological shift that counters that of the COVID phenotype: from T helper (Th) 1 cells, which stimulate inflammation and cell-mediated immunity, to Th2 cells, which promote humoral immunity. Phototherapy is also expected to address a range of reported respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine and metabolic long-COVID symptoms. Our PoC entails both validating via a clinical trial the proposed treatment, through a strong collaborative framework with Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel'Äôs second largest HMO, and conducting pre-commercialization steps to enable quick, easy dissemination on the global stage. Taken together, our value proposition is an effective, non-invasive, simple long-COVID treatment that can be implemented through already established phototherapy clinics worldwide, thereby offering immediate relief to long-COVID patients while simultaneously reducing the health and financial burden of severely overburdened health systems.",4,"4d, 4e"
C00218,Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antibody immune response in humans during infection (SARS-CoV-2_EVOLSERO project),"Aim: to understand the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 viral population in hosts during illness, in relation with the infectivity of the virus and the establishment of the humoral (antibody-based) immune response. This knowledge is important to identify trends in disease progression and help improve the treatment and post-treatment follow-up given to patients. Detailed data on the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 population in relation with disease progression, antiviral treatment and viral shedding sites will also be useful in evaluating links with disease severity and the potential failure of antiviral treatments. The aim is to elucidate the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in patients with Covid-19, depending on the severity of the disease, age and existing comorbidities (shedding in upper respiratory tracts - from the nose to the larynx - and lower respiratory tracts - from the windpipe to the alveoli, or at non-respiratory sites), and also to analyze the kinetics of the viral load at respiratory and non-respiratory sites in confirmed cases according to severity, age group and existing comorbidities. The project also intends to determine the correlation between the development of the viral load and infectivity, and to understand the kinetics of introducing a neutralizing humoral response (the body's production of antibodies to neutralize the virus).","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4a, 4b"
C04313,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 response on malaria control and malaria burden in rural Tanzania,"The World Health Organization has warned that deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year if malaria control programs are disrupted by COVID-19. Currently, 94% of all malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, with children and pregnant women amongst the most vulnerable groups. Given recent estimates that predict a return to mortality levels last seen 20 years ago, it is critical that countries can maintain the delivery of insecticide-treated nets and access to antimalarial medicines in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.     To better understand the COVID-19 response in Tanzania and its impacts on malaria control and burden, we will collect information on COVID-19 and malaria prevention practices, malaria care-seeking behaviours and health system impacts in a rural district where a large-scale malaria vector control trial is underway.     Data will be collected using a mixed methods approach through   (1) repeated cross-sectional surveys with 4200 households in January 2020, July 2020 and January 2021,   (2) focus group discussions with women and men in randomly selected communities, and   (3) key informant interviews with multiple health systems stakeholders.

We will conduct spatial and trend analyses of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative data to characterize individual and health systems level responses to COVID-19 and estimate gaps in malaria intervention coverage. We will use simulation models to estimate the potential impacts of changes in malaria control on the burden of malaria disease and death using the 'OpenMalaria' simulator of malaria epidemiology and control. Our results will inform strategies to tailor malaria control strategies in the context of COVID-19 in Tanzania to ultimately prevent a resurgence in malaria cases and deaths while ensuring effective pandemic response.",10,10a
C06106,An ethnographic study of the risks to and potentialities for social health during the Corona crisis (CoronaCare),"Political responses to the 'Corona pandemic' have predominantly focused on containing the spread of Sars-CoV-2 in order to maintain the physical health of the population. Everyone is simultaneously at risk of infection and a risk for infecting others. How humans as fundamentally social beings relate to each other is being radically altered in the responses to the 'Corona crisis'.    CoronaCare examines how the political and societal responses to the pandemic influence social health, including how people negotiate the risks regarding their social health during the crisis. From the perspective of social medicine, we understand social health as the everyday social experiences at the level of communities, social networks, families and individuals. CoronaCare investigates four interconnected specific research aims:     1. To understand the tensions that arise in individuals' lives who live under political regulations working to minimize in-person (embodied) interactions;   2. to analyse strategies that individuals and communities develop to uphold social health;   3. to examine how caregivers in informal and institutional settings negotiate the tensions in their care relationships under current regulations of social isolation and 'risk worries' of the Corona crisis; and   4. to document how care receivers experience these tensions, in particular social isolation and the 'risky' relationship with their caregivers. CoronaCare deploys an ethnographic study design, utilizing qualitative telephone interviews, citizen science/ethnographic observational methods and surveys as data collection tools.","9, 10","9a, 10b"
C07808,CORONA - VirAn-  Joint project: High-throughput multiplex bead assays; subproject 4: Validation and data analysis.,"With the VirAn kit, which is currently being developed by the VirAn team, customized multiplex assays can be rapidly assembled for the simultaneous - determination of IgG, IgM, IgA antibodies in serum, plasma or saliva against various respiratory viruses and - estimation of the immune status by measuring cytokine levels. Multiplex beads are used for this purpose, which can be read on flow cytometers or imaging systems commonly used in the laboratory. The determination of several parameters by means of one and the same measurement platform is a must if a quantitative comparison between the values is desired and if complex markers are to be identified. Furthermore, such multiplex measurement is a prerequisite when speed and affordability are important. The multiplex beads are easily scalable and the composition of the assay can be adapted to the respective requirements, as in a construction kit (custom-tailored assay). Within the scope of the subproject, the assay will be tested on human biological samples. In addition, user cases will be defined, data analysis tools will be set up and data analyses will be performed to identify multi-parameter predictive and diagnostic markers and immune correlates as well as to assess risks of complications.",1,"1a, 1d"
C10765,Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network: CoVaRR-Net,"Canadians are concerned about how mutations in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will impact how the virus is transmitted, whether it makes people more sick, and whether immunity conferred through previous exposures to SARS-CoV-2 or vaccination will still be able to fight off a mutated virus. Mutations to SARS-CoV-2 that have these outcomes are called ""Variants of Concern"" (VOC).  CoVaRR-Net, a rapid-response Network, will assist in the Government of Canada's overall strategy to address the threat of emerging VOC. The Network will enable the mobilization of Canadian research assets to answer critical and immediate questions regarding threats, such as increased transmissibility, pathogenicity and vaccine resistance, posed by an emerging VOC.   CoVaRR-Net will act as Canada's integrated platform for determining how VOCs impact Canadians from diverse communities and demographics. We will work collaboratively with national and international bodies such as the National Microbiology Lab, provincial/territorial public health labs, and the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network that are tracking how SARS-CoV-2 is mutating in real time. Central to CoVaRR-Net's service work will be a newly created Biobank for rapid sharing of samples and data with other biobanks across Canada in order to have a harmonized approach to the war on COVID-19.  Built on a foundation of eight thematic areas (Immunology & Vaccine Protection, in vitro & in vivo Characterizations, Functional Genomics & Structure Function of VOCs, Viral Genomics & Sequencing, and In Silico Modelling & Computational Biology, Public Health, Health Systems & Social Policy Impacts, Indigenous Outreach and Knowledge Mobilization), CoVaRR-Net is poised to contribute to the Canadian effort to mitigate the impact of harmful VOCs on citizens of Canada and on the world population.","1, 3","1c, 1d, 3d"
C15380,Developing a Mechanical Emulator to Simulate SARS-CoV-2 Droplet Cloud Formation and Propagation,"Project Summary  Our understanding of pathogen laden droplet/particle cloud formation and propagation remains  limited. Several approaches including use of computational tools, experimental tests by tracking  ejected droplets from subjects during emissions, and limited simulators by pumping and  dispersing powders, have been implemented. Yet there is no adequate respiratory emission  emulator that could holistically replicate saliva liquid atomization and the breakup process  corresponding to each main explosive event such as sneezing, coughing, or speaking loudly. In  this proposal, our overarching aim is to fill this gap by developing and testing a spray system  that emulates respiratory events. This device can be used as an alternative subject to mimic the  main respiratory events with higher flexibilities in terms of availability/safety, superior droplet  tracking, and wider representation of subjects. To develop this new device, three specific aims  are proposed: Aim 1. Design and fabricate the emulator spray system capable of simulating  respiratory events in terms of droplet size & velocity distributions and counts of the formed  droplet cloud. The system includes a hardware and a PC-based control unit to enforce desired  air pressure profile, particular to each type of emission and ensued droplet cluster. Aim 2.  Characterize emulator ensued plume and compare it to ejected droplet cloud from actual  respiratory emissions using high-speed imaging and laser diffraction. Aim 3. Find relevant  pulsating pressure and flowrate profiles to emulate typical explosive respiratory events. The  long-term goal of the project is to add more features to the device (e.g. adding motions) to  gradually approach the actual phenomena.  This novel proposed emulator can be used to mimic flow and evolution of pathogen laden  droplets; therefore, it provides opportunities for training healthcare workers and the public on the  best preventative practices and design of adequate ventilation systems. Furthermore, the project  aids faculty and underrepresented students at Tuskegee University (a Historically Black  University) in developing/testing a novel mechanical emulator to better understand a virus  propagation route through engineering tools. It also helps students to see how engineering and  other disciplines can come together and contribute to a public health crisis.  1",1,1b

C01337,Serological Vaccine Standards for Emerging Diseases,"The development of safe, effective and economically affordable vaccines against Emerging Diseases, such as Ebola and Zika, would provide powerful tools not only to prevent re-emergence of these diseases in countries where they are endemic, but also enable swift and effective control of outbreaks initiated by infected returning travellers.  However, these infectious agents can only be handled under high levels of bio-security, making the cost of research on these agents prohibitive for most commercial organisations.  The availability of established standards and reference materials accelerates the development of licenced vaccines.  Where there is robust evidence that convalescent serum (ie serum obtained from someone who has recovered from an infectious disease) protects against reinfection, then the preparation and distribution of serum standards that have been demonstrated to confer protection against infection is hugely beneficial.  These serum standards facilitate pre-clinical and early clinical development and selection of the most promising experimental vaccine without the need for expensive studies under bio-containment, as the serum standard provides as in vitro reference marker for serological protection. NIBSC is the global leader in the development of World Health Organisation (WHO) established International Standards and reference materials for biological medicines such as vaccines.  At the request of the WHO, NIBSC is undertaking a programme to develop and establish sero-diagnostic reference materials for the WHO's List of Priority Pathogens,that heavily overlaps with the UK Vaccine Network Priority Emerging Diseases.   NIBSC has prepared an International Standard for anti-Ebola virus antibodies that was established by the WHO's Expert Committee for Biological Standardisation in October 2017.  An anti-Zika virus antibody standard will be reviewed in October 2018 as well as a preliminary report about an anti-MERS-CoV antibody material. Whilst these candidate materials have been through detailed in vitro analyses in international collaborative studies, without additional competitively awarded funding from InnovateUK, it would not have been possible to establish that the serological reference materials contained specific antibodies capable of preventing infection or disease in in vivo model systems.  They are now established as serological vaccine standards and available globally. This previous Innovate UK funding, (for 1 year) enabled NIBSC to collaborate with Dstl and PHE laboratories at Porton Down.   Their high level bio-containment facilities allowed these critical protection studies to be performed and demonstrated that serological reference materials against Ebola, Zika and MersCoV could protect against these lethal diseases.  Having established an effective collaboration between the 3 centres, NIBSC is now seeking a further 2 years funding to build on this momentum, utilising this PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY to prepare a further 9 candidate sero-diagnostic reference preparations, one each for the remaining UK Vaccine Network Priority Emerging Diseases, and establish whether these materials can protect in appropriate in vivo model systems.  If materials protect, then they add to the list of serological vaccine standards and thus accelerate vaccine development against Chikungunya, CCHF, Marburg, Lassa Fever, Nipah, Hanta, Rift Valley Fever viruses and bacterial infections Q Fever and Plague.",7,7h

Its spread is such that it has since been declared pandemic and represents a public health emergency. Europe quickly became heavily impacted by the virus, now joined by America, areas where political and health authorities are trying with great difficulties to contain the epidemic that seriously affects elderly or co-morbid people.  The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect many sensitive regions with fragile health care systems, such as Africa. Indeed, 2230 cases have already been confirmed in Mali so far, affecting every region. Bamako is the most impacted city. Caregivers, in the front line of Covid19 patient management, may accidentally become infected and a source of infection during the incubation phase or in case of asymptomatic infection.  The objectives of this project are thus i) to limit SARS-Cov-2 spread over the hospital departments of Bamako by carrying out a systematic molecular screening of symptomatic persons (patients/caregivers) or confirmed cases contacts and by highlighting transmission clusters, and ii) to evaluate the feasibility of Point-Of-Care molecular assays in Mali. In addition, iii) viral spread and immunity acquired from SARS-Cov-2 among health workers through serological testing, allowing also the assessment of asymptomatic caregivers rate and absence of re-infection among the immunized caregivers. Finally, iv) variability of the virus over time and spread of different variants around the world will be studied by sequencing the viral genome.  The data obtained during this collaborative work will better characterize the COVID19 infection in Bamako and will give the opportunity to struggle against in real time, while it seems essential to limit as much as possible the spread of the virus in developing countries.

C19647,"Engage, Educate, Empower: Partnering with Canadian Families to Understand and Mitigate the Multifaceted Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Child and Youth Wellbeing","On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 disease a global pandemic. In efforts to keep the public protected, the Canadian government has implemented physical distancing policies and widespread closure of public institutions. However, these measures have had unintentional consequences for Canadian youth, including disruptions to education, intake of misinformation, and increased levels of isolation, stress, and anxiety. Efforts to understand the impact of COVID-19 on youth's experiences, behaviours, and beliefs are needed to improve  circumstances, knowledge and trust in this vulnerable population. Our team will address this gap through a national research study that will result in the development of a public education and engagement campaign. This will be achieved in three phases of work: 1) Online surveys with parents and youth to to create a comprehensive list of COVID-19 associated policies and restrictions that most impacted their wellbeing; 2) Interviews with parents and youth to gain a deeper understanding of the major factors (stressors and protective mechanisms) influencing youth wellbeing; 3) development and application of targeted integrated knowledge translation interventions to inform social and public health responses and improve youth and family wellbeing. This study will complement ongoing parallel research in the adult population currently being conducted by our team with the ultimate goal to partner with Canadian youth and families to understand the detrimental and positive impacts of the pandemic and related restrictions on their wellbeing (health, connectedness, safety, learning, agency), and optimize opportunities for recovery and long-term resilience.","9, 10","9a, 10a, 10b"
C20439,Blunted Neural Response to Reward as an Index of Stress Susceptibility and Depression in Women,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most common and costly diseases worldwide. Stress is a well-established risk factor for depression, but not all individuals who experience stress will develop depression. Understanding this relationship is now more critical than ever given that the world is experiencing a potent stressor-the COVID-19 pandemic-that is associated with rising levels of depressive symptoms, especially for women. One central need is to identify which individuals are at greatest risk for depression in the face of stress and to understand why. A blunted neural response to reward can be observed not only in people experiencing depression, but also in those at risk for the disorder suggesting that it may be a vulnerability marker for the illness. I believe stress may be key to explaining how these neural responses result in depression. In recent years, my lab has published many studies demonstrating that blunted neural responses to reward render individuals more vulnerable to the effects of stress. Specifically, the reward positivity (RewP), a fronto-central event-related potential (ERP) component that is sensitive to rewards and has been consistently linked to increased depressive symptoms and risk for depression. My proposed research will examine how baseline neural responses to reward predict who will be most likely to experience increases in depressive symptoms following pandemic-related stress. To test this question, I will leverage data from a sample of 109 pairs of women and their adolescent daughters who are vulnerable to depression. This study will be the first to examine reward-related ERPs as a moderator of the relationship between life stress and depression in women in the context of an acute stressor- the global COVID-19 pandemic. ",10,10a

P22593,Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,"Project Summary / Abstract  The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding  bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables  widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by  the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome  of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest.  Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiÃ¯Â¬Âca-  tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls  can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods  for identiÃ¯Â¬Âcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding,  incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth-  ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies  using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine  effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety  using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with  paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators  to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiÃ¯Â¬Âc research.","3, 11","3c, 11d"
C03612,Survival rates and long-term outcomes for patients with COVID-19 admitted to Norwegian ICUs,"The study will be conducted as a collaborative study between Norwegian Intensive Care Register (NIR) and Oslo University Hospital. The study will explore and describe the Norwegian ICU-population with COVID-19. NIR is one of several national quality registries in the Norwegian health care system. Registration is mandatory for all ICU-admissions fulfilling specific criteria. This will increase the generalizability of the results. The data collected during the COVID-19 epidemic may also be compared to existing NIR data, particularly those obtained from previously registered influenza patients, to identify similarities and discrepancies in the management and outcomes in these groups of patients.    Respiratory failure is the main cause of ICU-admission for COVID-19 patients. The present project will also collect follow-up data from the NIR registry for all survivors of COVID-19.  The negative consequences of surviving an ICU stay has received increased attention in recent years, as decreased mortality rates have contributed to a high number of ICU survivors. It has been reported that survivors of ARF of any aetiology report substantial impairment in physical functioning and quality of life (QOL) up to 5 years after ICU discharge.     The one-year follow-up study will include questionnaires that captures physical, psychological and mental health related challenges occurring after ICU treatment.",4,"4b, 4c, 4d"
C01062,Postwar Urban Reconstruction in China 1937 - 1958,"The coronavirus pandemic has left city streets silent and passenger usage on public transport has plummeted. In the UK, the time to devise innovative strategies for managing people's access to urban public space and transport systems is now. This is so resources can be allocated effectively and people prepared through public messaging before the lockdown eases.    This project will provide information on policies for managing public use of transport systems and urban spaces from China and Taiwan, and analyse the public reaction to them. In China, it will focus on the cities of Wuhan, which experienced an early initially uncontrolled outbreak and a severe lockdown, and Shanghai, where the authorities had some time to prepare. In Taiwan, it will focus on Taipei. The value of the comparison is that there are similarities in urban organization between Taiwan and China, but that the Taiwanese response has involved transparent governance and community consultation. In China, while there has been community support for many policies, there has been no public involvement in their design, and enforcement is more stringent.    This project will proceed in two stages following the employment of a PhD student at Leicester as an RA. The RA is a native Chinese speaker, who will work under the PI's direction. This linguistic ability is essential to quickly engage with the complex the social media spaces in China and Taiwan.    Month 1 (May): RA and PI to identify policies put in place related to access to public transport and public space in case study cities. A short report will be prepared summarizing these policies and sent to UK policy contacts.    Months 2 - 7 (June - December): RA and PI to look at public response to these measures. This will use social media analysis (Weibo and Weixin in China, Facebook and Twitter in Taiwan), and more traditional print media. An initial report mapping the key trends will be followed up with a further report towards the end of the project, although if UK stakeholders request more regular updates this is possible.

P21192,Mechanism of cell-to-cell transmission of flaviviruses,"This proposal will investigate the mechanism of cell-to-cell transmission and spread of flaviviruses using Dengue and Zika as model systems. We will therefore address a longstanding debate on how they exit from infected cells, and preferentially spread into specific cell types. Dengue and Zika are the two most prevalent flaviviruses worldwide, sharing significant overlap in their genome architecture and biology. Dengue infects >50 million people annually, causing severe pathologies. Zika too has emerged as a global threat with recent outbreaks linked to serious neuro-developmental complications in children and Guillain BarrÃ© syndrome in adults. No vaccines or therapeutics exist for these viruses, and our current understanding on mechanisms of their transmission and spread is severely limited. Viral infections spread by overcoming multiple barriers to move from cell to cell. Viral progenies can move across extracellular space either as free particles via fluid phase diffusion, within vesicles, or by cell-cell contacts. To understand transmission, we will therefore address: (i) characteristics of the extracellular virus populations, (ii) whether multiple transmission routes exist (iii) whether the viral envelope is the primary determinant of transmissibility. This proposal builds on our previously published and ongoing studies on viral manipulation of autophagy for assembly and spread.",1,1b

P21405,Exploring Risk Factors for Sequential and Concurrent Dengue and Zika Outbreaks in a Naïve Population,"Flaviviruses pose an ever increasing problem for the worldwide population. Before 1970 only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics; now dengue is endemic in over 100 countries. Similarly, before the 1980s human infection from Zika was a very rare occurrence; now 86 countries have reported mosquito-transmitted Zika outbreaks. It is challenging to predict which flaviviruses will result in the next epidemic and the dynamics between co-circulating pathogens may be responsible for increased morbidity. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is known to increase the severity of dengue-related illnesses when a population is infected with different serotypes of dengue consecutively. It is believed that this mechanism may also occur between dengue and Zika owing to their near identical structures, which is particularly concerning as they share the same vectors, Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. As a result of climate change, the habitat of these mosquitoes is expanding and in recent years persistent populations of A. albopictus have been found as far north as Southern Ontario in Canada with A. aegypti being found in previous years. Currently, there is no approved vaccine for dengue or Zika. For dengue this is in part due to the effects of ADE, which could see vaccinated individuals with no prior exposure experiencing severe side effects should they be subsequently infected. Therefore, the dynamics within dengue serotypes and between them and Zika is crucially important for any future prevention and control policies.     This project aims to elucidate the dynamics of co-circulating flaviviruses considering ADE through the use of statistical and mechanistic models. By integrating the statistical models used currently by the Public Health Care Agency of Canada (PHAC) to represent the distribution of Aedes across Canada with a mechanistic model for dengue and Zika considering ADE, we will be able to forecast the change in risk for sequential and concurrent dengue and Zika outbreaks that take into account the effect of climate change.This project will determine the number of imported cases and vectors carrying dengue and/or Zika required for sequential and concurrent outbreaks to occur and which environmental and demographic variables have the biggest impact upon future invasion risk.    Modelling infectious diseases requires an interdisciplinary approach and this project will take full advantage of the wide variety of specialists accessible through Dr Greer and her lab group. Her monthly lab group meetings are attended by individuals from PHAC which facilitates an exchange of ideas and expertise between academics and policy makers. There will be opportunities to collaborate with other academics such as Dr Heffernan who specialises in co-infection, from York University, and Dr Rob Deardon, a biostatistician at the University of Calgary. Furthermore Entomogen Inc., a company which monitors the mosquito population and carries out viral testing, is based in Ontario. Visits to this group will improve understanding of how mosquito data are gathered and elucidate any possible biases in reported data. Finally, in 2020 the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene are holding their annual conference in Toronto, which will provide an ideal opportunity to network with experts in the flavivirus research.    At the conclusion of this project we will have developed a model that can be utilised to establish the risk of outbreaks of dengue fever and Zika occurring in Canada that takes into account future climate change. The outputs of this model will be communicated directly to our collaborators at the University of Guelph and PHAC, thus informing contingency planning for outbreaks of flaviviruses in Canada in the future.",3,"3a, 3b, 3d"

P22340,Transcriptional and functional profiling of cross-reactive T cells to understand outcomes for the pathogen and host during heterologous infection,"Zika virus (ZIKV) spread explosively throughout the Americas in 2015, leaving in its wake a devastating and  ever-expanding list of sequela associated with infection. Since this epidemic, substantial effort has been put forth  to understand the emergence of ZIKV in the Americas, the course of disease and importantly, the correlates of  protection. ZIKV is a member of the flavivirus genus which includes other arthropod-borne human pathogens  such as yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). In  addition to circulating in mosquito populations in the same geographic regions, flaviviruses share a substantial  degree of genetic, and consequently antigenic similarity. This begs the question: In areas of endemic flavivirus  circulation, how does immunity to one flavivirus shape immunity to the next? Moreover, how does this divergent  immune restriction alter the viral swarms that replicate within the host? These questions are of great importance  due to what we know about DENV. The enhanced disease seen in secondary infection with a heterologous  serotype of DENV has been hypothesized to be mediated by both suboptimal cross-reactive antibody and T cell  responses. The proposed research study is to define how exposure to a heterologous flavivirus shapes the  transcriptional and functional T cell response to ZIKV in a mouse model of infection, and how those T cells in  turn impact viral populations within the host and ultimately pathogenesis.  We have shown previously that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play important roles in protection from ZIKV disease in a  mouse model of infection and were able to identify specific epitopes to which the responses are directed in this  H2b-restricted model. We have also generated data showing that effector CD8+ T cells generated during infection  with DENV1-4, YFV, Usutu virus, Kunjin virus or WNV functionally cross-react with at least one ZIKV CD8+  epitope, which we are terming a Ã¢Â€Âœpan-flavivirusÃ¢Â€Â epitope. We have found that prior infection with a heterologous  flavivirus results in altered phenotypic responses to this cross-reactive epitope during a subsequent ZIKV  infection compared to a homologous ZIKV prime-boost challenge or a primary ZIKV challenge. One specific  example of this is that cross-reactive cells derived from a heterologous infection produce far more Granzyme B  relative to homologously derived cells. However, it is still unknown what drives these functional changes and  how they impact protection from ZIKV-induced disease, which will be evaluated in Aim 1. More recently, it is  being appreciated that different immune selective pressures can impact the viral populations that evolve within  the host during infection, particularly in RNA viruses. How this observed altered T cell function during  heterologous ZIKV infection alters viral quasispecies diversity within the host will be evaluated in Aim 2.",1,"1b, 1d"

C19741,Lessening the Impact of COVID-19 on Child and Youth Mental Health,"There is growing evidence that the pandemic and measures meant to curb spread of the virus, such as school closures and mask mandates, had repercussions on the mental health of children and adolescents. However, the pandemic's impact on youth mental health remains unclear. Children are underrepresented in research, and most studies are based on self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.  This project will determine how the pandemic affected major youth mental health problems in Quebec, including suicide attempt, drug overdose, eating disorders, and injuries due to child maltreatment. We will identify whether policies and practices such as curfews during the pandemic had an impact on these outcomes. We will also identify specific subgroups of children and adolescents that were more vulnerable during the pandemic.  To carry out this work, we will analyze all hospitalizations in children and adolescents under 20 years of age in Quebec, Canada before and during the pandemic. We will study suicide attempt, drug overdose, alcohol intoxication, eating disorders, and home injuries due to maltreatment. We will assess whether pandemic control measures, socioeconomic conditions, chronic diseases, and other characteristics of children influenced the pandemic's impact on youth mental health.  This project will measure the impact of COVID-19 on understudied mental health problems in children and adolescents, and will identify vulnerable groups in need of support during pandemic recovery and future public health crises. Quebec was the most severely affected province at the start of the pandemic.

Recently,  distinct astrocyte activation states have been described, though the molecular mechanisms that govern astrocyte  polarization during neurotropic viral infection are not well understood. Here, we propose that receptor-interacting  protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) is a previously unappreciated driver of inflammatory astrocyte activation during viral  infection of the CNS. While roles for RIPK3 in programmed cell death have been extensively characterized, our  published work has described pleiotropic, cell death-independent functions for this pathway in the coordination  of protective neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis. In preliminary studies, we now show that RIPK3  signaling in astrocytes is required for survival and virologic control following challenge with Zika virus, an  emerging neurotropic pathogen of global concern. Using a combination of novel mouse genetic tools, we will  elucidate roles for RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes by 1) Defining profiles of expression, activation, and antiviral  function for astrocytic RIPK3; 2) Determining roles for astrocytic RIPK3 signaling in coordinating  neuroinflammation; and 3) Defining key substrates and transcriptional outputs of RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes.  Together, our studies promise to identify new molecular mechanisms governing protective neuroimmune function  during viral encephalitis.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
P22835,Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,"Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great  public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs,  and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate  receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor-  binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animalÃ¢Â€Â""human interface.  However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most  of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to  develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by  using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs,  including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines,  equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We  expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin  IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and  transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and  block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging  influenza threats at the animalÃ¢Â€Â""human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for  identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to  determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms,  including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays.","1, 2","1b, 2a"
C03014,Awake Prone Position in Hypoxemic Patients with Coronavirus Disease 19,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can cause low oxygen levels and life-threatening lung failure. Many COVID-19 patients will need treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with life support and a breathing machine. A possible treatment that could stop patients in hospital from developing lung failure is prone positioning. Prone positioning is when a patient lays on their stomach and rests for several hours. The risks of prone positioning in COVID-19 are not known. We designed a clinical trial to test if prone positioning before patients need life support can prevent death or the need for a breathing machine. Patients with COVID-19 and low oxygen levels will be treated with either prone positioning or normal positioning. The clinical trial will be performed at 34 hospitals across Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. If prone positioning saves patients' lives or prevents the need for breathing machines, it will be used in hospitals across Canada and around the world.",4,4e

C03065,Vaccination in a pandemic: The impact on routine vaccinations and future COVID-19 vaccine acceptance,"Canadians are asking: During the pandemic, should my children or myself receive our regular vaccines? Is it safe to go to my vaccination appointment? Could COVID-19 make me seriously ill? Will new COVID-19 vaccines be safe, since they are being made so quickly? Will there be enough COVID-19 vaccines for everyone? Like everyone else in the world, Canadians face many concerns about COVID-19, and Canadian health care systems are grappling with the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. Physical distancing measures that have been put in place to reduce spread of COVID-19 have led to challenges in providing, and accessing, routine vaccines for all ages, such as those for measles or meningitis. At the same time, one of the primary options for containment of the pandemic is through future COVID-19 vaccines. However, public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is already being questioned in the media, and initial vaccine shortages will require prioritization of who receives the vaccine first. An understanding of Canadians' acceptance of future vaccines and their perspectives on vaccine prioritization will be critical before vaccines are rolled-out. The aim of this project is to support the public health system in these tasks. We will begin by assessing how provincial and territorial health systems are delivering routine vaccinations during the pandemic, examining what the public think about routine vaccines during this time, and then measuring whether less/more people are getting vaccinated with routine vaccines during the pandemic. Second, since population support for a vaccination program is critical to its success, we will examine public acceptability of new COVID-19 vaccines and the determinants of acceptability. The project will provide Canada's public health system with essential information to organize the distribution of routine vaccines during the pandemic and to prepare for the inevitable COVID-19 mass vaccination program that is on the horizon.",9,"9a, 9d"
C06341,Glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 to identify the structural characteristics of COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is a human virus emerging from the Coronaviridae family. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of a new pneumonia called COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019. Due to the rapid increase in the number of cases affecting several countries, WHO has classified the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic ongoing. As of April 1, there were 750,890 confirmed cases and 36,405 deaths worldwide. Understanding the virus-host dynamics is fundamental for the development of prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, in addition to the establishment of measures for the epidemiological control of COVID-19. Many molecular aspects still need to be understood about the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 and the host's response during infection, e.g. molecular and cellular markers of serious, mild and asymptomatic infections, providing a better understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this project, we propose the application of a spatial and temporal proteomic approach to characterize the SARS-CoV-2: host interaction, to be addressed on three interconnected fronts: (1) evaluation of the signaling pathways activated by systematic quantitative analysis of the temporal dynamics in protein and glycosylation changes during infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2; (2) characterization of the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 proteome and PTMs; and (3) development of an early diagnosis and prognosis platform based on the proteomic profile of sera from patients with different clinical characteristics. The proposed project will contribute to broaden the understanding of viral pathogenesis and will prioritize the discovery of biomarkers for rapid diagnostic tests.","1, 4","1a, 1b, 4a, 4b"
P21623,Origin of the innate immunity suppression caused by nairovirus' protease activity,"Summary/Abstract  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever,  prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5-  80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities.  Originally identified in Russia and the Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of  Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, CCHFV has illustrated its continued ability to spread into  previously naive regions. At the same time, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the  regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South-Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk  for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the  only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses  Issyk-kul, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. There  is no vaccine or prophylactic currently available for treatment of CCHF or any other nairovirus related  disease. Reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located  within the nairovirus genome. Recently, vOTUsÃ¢Â€Â™ ability to reverse post-translational modification by  proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15) on a narrow subset of host  pathways has been illustrated to be critical to pathogenesis. Also, vOTUs from CCHFV and other  nairoviruses have been found to be sensitive to species-species variations in ISG15 and their  specificity includes at least the species that disease is most prominently identified. This proposal will  determine the identity of specific host proteins within those pathways targeted by vOTUs. This will  enable therapeutic approaches that protect, or elevate, specific host inhibitory factors for these  viruses. The proposal will also seek to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate  species-specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence and zoonotic range of the  nairoviruses in question. Additionally, the efficacy of using CCHFV vaccine candidates with altered  CCHF vOTU functions will be assessed. Together, the resulting information will provide critical insight  into the role of vOTUs play in pathogenesis and host restriction as well as advance the development  of prophylactics targeting vOTUs.","1, 4, 6, 7","1b, 1c, 4b, 6g, 7i"
C07301,Supporting Parents and Kids through Lockdown Experiences (SPARKLE),"Co-SPACE, a UKRI-funded nationwide study of families' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, found a significant increase in children's behaviour problems (Cohen's d = .21; p < .001) over the first months of lockdown. Additionally, 70% of respondents asked for extra parenting support. This confirms concerns of an upcoming surge in behavioural challenges in schools and increased parental help-seeking from already overstretched children's services, as lockdown restrictions ease off and families readjust to the 'new normal'. Supporting Parents and Kids through Lockdown Experiences (SPARKLE) is a rapid deployment randomised controlled trial evaluating whether an intervention in the form of a digital public health parenting intervention - Families Under Pressure plus (FuP+) - can reverse these negative effects. FuP+ includes eight animations covering universal evidence-based parenting messages designed to be delivered at scale in an engaging way by celebrity parents. FuP+ animations will be accessed via a mobile application, which will supplement and contextualise the messages to provide easily accessible practical parenting resource. Embedding SPARKLE in Co-SPACE, with pre- and post-intervention measures extracted from routinely, monthly, collected data, will ensure rapid implementation. 616 Co-SPACE participants will be automatically randomised to either FuP+ or follow-up as usual (FAU). This will give statistical power to test whether FuP+ can reverse the negative effects of lockdown by producing a positive effect on behaviour equal in size and opposite to lockdown's negative effect. If results are positive, FuP+ will be disseminated rapidly through collaboration with Public Health England and Department for Education, in cooperation with commercial media partners.","9, 10","9a, 10a"
C03945,Integrated Metagenomic and Metatranscriptomic Characterization of Inflammatory Chronic Rhinosinusitis Endotypes,"SUMMARYThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands a swift response to address a broad range of medical and scientificquestions to mitigate harm to populations and slow and eventually eliminate the epidemic. To understand thecourse, history, and pathogenesis that will lead to effective therapies and vaccines it is critical to answerseveral fundamental scientific questions longitudinally: Viral, genetic, ecological factors and co-morbidity/co-infections risk factors need to be identified for 1) symptomatic and asymptomatic infection; 2) prolongedshedding; and 3) acute and chronic sequelae. In particular we must define correlates of reduced viral loadin upper airways early in disease, and the host-viral response that defines later severe lowerrespiratory disease and ARDS that is prefaced by cytokine storm. We hypothesize that a combination ofviral (high viral load, specific viral signature of virulence, respiratory viral co-infection and virome), ecological(such as, microbiome community structure/function) and host (local mucosal immune response) factors willpredict disease outcomes and severity. Below are our specific aims to address our hypothesis: Aim 1:Determine longitudinal kinetics of SARS-CoV2 viral load to establish association between nasal viral load andviral shedding with disease severity. Aim 2: Characterize how SARS-CoV2 infection changes nasalmicrobiome composition, structure and secondary bacterial infection during Covid-19. Aim 3: To examine ifnasal microbiome patterns during SARS-CoV2 infection are associated with local immune responses andcytokine storm. Collectively, this study will identify determinants of SARS-CoV2 viral kinetics, persistence,virus-host and microbiome interactions. Specifically, our proposal will advance our understanding of the role ofthe upper airway microbiome in Covid-19 and establish its role in programming of the local immune responseupon SARS-CoV2 infection and effects on Covid-19 outcomes.",1,"1b, 1d"
P22604,Defining the Role of the Plasminogen Activator Protease in the Early Events that Establish Primary Pneumonic Plague,"Project Summary  Pneumonic plague is the deadliest form of disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Early after infection, Y. pestis  subverts host innate immune mechanisms in the lung and replicates to high numbers before the onset of lethal  host inflammatory responses. As a result, pneumonic plague is difficult to treat once symptoms are recognized.  This proposal introduces the Yersinia Plasminogen activator protease (Pla) as an important mediator of early  host/pathogen interactions in the lung. Pla is well-established virulence factor known to be essential to the  pathogenesis of pneumonic plague via an unknown function. The work proposed here examines the dual role of  Pla, as both an adhesin and a protease, during pulmonary infection. The objective of this work is to define the  function of the critical Yersinia virulence factor Pla in the early events of pneumonic plague to understand how  Y. pestis resists clearance by host inflammatory responses to establish an initial replicative phase in the lungs.  The strategy for this proposal is outlined below:  Specific Aim 1. Define the role of Pla-mediated T3S during pneumonic plague. The adhesin function of Pla  facilitates targeting of alveolar macrophages for type 3 secretion (T3S) early during pneumonic plague. Aim 1  will generate and test mutants of Pla to understand how Pla mediates adherence, and characterize the  importance of Pla-mediated adherence and T3S in vivo. Further, the impact of Pla-mediated T3S on host cell  innate immune responses to T3S will be evaluated during infection to understand how Y. pestis limits host  responsiveness early during infection.  Specific Aim 2. Characterize novel proteolytic functions of Pla during pneumonic plague. Preliminary data  has identified two novel functions of Pla that may contribute to pathogenesis. A proteomics approach will be  used to identify and characterize Pla proteolytic activity early during primary pneumonic plague.  Specific Aim 3. Identify key host cell types and dynamics responsible for establishing an early pre-  inflammatory disease phase during pneumonic plague. Preliminary data indicates that deletion of Pla  disrupts the ability of Y. pestis to limit early innate immune responses in the lung. In Aim 3 we will evaluate host  cell dynamics and innate immune responses in the lung in the presence and absence of Pla to understand how  Y. pestis is able to subvert initial inflammatory responses and establish infection in the lung.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"
C10007,"Analysing group testing algorithms for COVID-19 surveillance and case identification in UK schools, universities, and health and social care settings","In the context of a pandemic disease such as Covid-19, group testing (also known as 'pooled testing' or 'batch testing') provides a way of identifying infected individuals in a large group, by pooling samples together in different ways and testing the pooled samples. Group-testing algorithms can yield large efficiency gains over individual testing, when the number of infected individuals (i.e., the prevalence) is relatively low. This project will analyse whether and how strategies based on group-testing algorithms may be effectively used for monitoring Covid-19 prevalence, and for case-identification (i.e., screening of asymptomatics to identify infected individuals), in UK schools, universities, care homes and health care settings. Close attention will be paid to all the practically relevant issues: the impacts on public health and education-loss, resource requirements/costs, the practical ease or difficulty of implementing different strategies in situations of changing (and geographically varying) prevalence, the feasibility of incorporating a pooling step into existing UK testing systems, and ethical/anonymity requirements. As well as producing technical preprints and papers, we will produce non-technical reports aimed at policymakers and written in a way accessible to those without mathematical or scientific training, to aid decision-makers in determining which protocols to implement. Our initial focus will be on schools and universities, and later we will extend our study to health and social care settings.",1,1a

C00146,Coronavirus Outbreak: Mapping and Countering Misinformation,"The spread of health misinformation and disinformation are a serious threat to public health, including in the case of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Addressing the spread of COVID-19 misinformation involves identifying the misinformation in circulation, understanding the public impact, and designing and implementing evidence-based solutions to combat the harmful discourse. We propose conducting research into COVID-19 misinformation from multiple angles, developing effective communication and education tools, countering misinformation strategically, and providing policy recommendations to deal with COVID-19 and future outbreaks. Our interdisciplinary team of experts is led by Timothy Caulfield, Canada Research Chair and Health Law Institute Research Director, who has been studying health and science misinformation for over 20 years. Our team will conduct systematic content analyses of traditional and online social media and empirical psychological research on how individuals respond to COVID-19 information. The objective is to assemble and execute a depth-of-analysis sufficient to enact positive outcomes for COVID-19 while establishing a blueprint for future misinformation events. The impact of this course of research will be significant, enabling the development of strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear, to address their underlying drivers, and to improve public awareness, knowledge, and trust. We will meet the call's objectives of contributing to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak, strengthening the understanding of its public impacts, and providing evidence to inform public health planning, decision making and response.

C13794,Overcoming emerging COVID-19 challenges with relatable science: Developing and evaluating knowledge tools for Canadians,"We have an established program through which we co-create knowledge tools with parents. These tools cover a range of common conditions for which parents seek pediatric healthcare. Currently we have 24 tools (www.echokt.ca) that merge the best available science about how to manage the conditions with the power of parent experiences. Over the past 16 years, we have learned that the strategic merger of the best available science couched within the persuasive power of experience makes science more relatable. We will re-focus our work to create knowledge tools about COVID19 to increase the public's confidence in science and to encourage vaccine uptake and maintenance of ongoing public health measures (social distancing, mask use). Our proposal involves four parts. First, we will conduct interviews/focus groups with families (including diverse community groups, those with low health literacy, and those whose first language is not English) to understand their concerns about COVID19, particularly in response to vaccine hesitancy and other public health measures. It is anticipated that vaccine hesitancy will emerge as a challenge with children and young adults given the low incidence of significant morbidity experienced with COVID19. Second, we will develop infographics and videos that merge parent experience with the best available science to address the knowledge needs identified. Third, we will undertake usability testing to ensure that our tools meet the needs of Canada's diverse population. Fourth, in collaboration with several established national networks, we will disseminate the knowledge tools through a structured social media campaign using platforms and methods (e.g., influencers) known to increase uptake of health messages. We have long-standing relationships with many provincial/national groups and we have an established parent advisory group and a virtual, national parent network that will provide critical input at all stages of development and evaluation.",9,"9a, 9d"
P22525,American and Asian Centers for Arboviral Research and Enhanced Surveillance (A2CARES),"ABSTRACT  Recent pandemics of human pathogens have revealed the limitations of current surveillance systems. The  sequential arboviral epidemics in the Americas showed how outbreak detection can be delayed and opportunities  missed to collect well-characterized specimens and data for surveillance, basic science, clinical research, and  development of vaccines and new diagnostics. In response, we have assembled a consortium of world-renowned  investigators in arbovirology, epidemiology, immunology, viral diagnostics, phylogenetics, and clinical research,  while leveraging research infrastructure and expertise in long-term cohort and hospital-based studies. This has  resulted from 3 decades of collaborative international research, with over 200 joint publications, and extensive  experience in preparing for and responding to outbreaks working closely with local and international health  authorities and NIAID. With key sites in Asia and the Americas, we will use innovative molecular and serological  methods to identify emerging pathogens and to address fundamental questions in dengue and other arboviral  epidemiology and test viral, host and environmental determinants of differences between sites along a gradient  of urbanicity. Our overarching goal is to develop an interconnected, harmonized network of clinical and  laboratory sites to strengthen research programs, compare disease epidemiology and severity in  different regions, develop and implement cutting-edge diagnostic methods, and respond efficiently and  effectively to outbreaks. Standardized hospital studies and community-based cohorts in Ecuador, Nicaragua  and Sri Lanka will characterize and compare human arboviral illnesses across urban, peri-urban and rural sites  and develop sustainable infrastructure to rapidly respond to epidemics together with Ministries of Health, comple-  mented by outbreak investigation, surveillance of non-human primates, and vector incrimination. We will imple-  ment standardized plans for study administration, data and clinical management, and statistical analysis across  sites, supported by an extensive on-site training program. Aim 1 will establish standard and novel multiplex  assays at each site for surveillance, diagnosis and research of arboviruses and other pathogens. Aim 2 com-  pares dengue/arbovirus epidemiology and transmission in cohort studies located in ecologically distinct regions  over a continuum of urbanicity. In Aim 3, we will characterize complete viral genome sequences for comparative  studies of arboviral phylogenetics, phylogeography and molecular epidemiology. Aim 4 consists of surveillance,  identification, and characterization of novel and unrecognized human pathogens from severe hospitalized cases,  unexpected outbreaks, vectors and non-human primates. Molecular and serological assays will be developed  for newly identified pathogens and quickly implemented across study sites to characterize the epidemiology and  clinical manifestations and will be made available to the EIDRC network. In sum, our A2CARES Consortium will  provide valuable new tools and knowledge and 3 interconnected centers in Latin America and South Asia that  will be able to respond to outbreaks and to study emerging and endemic infectious diseases far into the future.","1, 3","1a, 1b, 3a, 3d"

For this proposal, we will leverage the infrastructure of a NIMHD-funded project in theFamily Health Centers (FHCs) of NYU Langone Health, a network of federally qualified health centers in NYCthat serves over 125,000 low-income and racially and ethnically diverse patients. In the current application, wepropose a three-phase community-engaged study that will employ a multipronged, sequential mixed methodsdesign (i.e., one methodology builds on the findings of the other) to gain a comprehensive understanding of themultilevel factors that drive uptake of testing (and future vaccination) for COVID-19 of Black and Latinx patients(primary outcome), and participation in follow-up care offered by safety-net health systems. Phase 1 will consistof three steps: In step 1, we will leverage a well-characterized electronic health record database (~75% Blackand Latinx) to examine differences in the individual-level factors associated with receiving a positive versusnegative PCR test for COVID-19 among 400 Black and Latinx patients who receive care at the FHCs. We willalso capture the community- and structural-level determinants of testing in this sample using validated self-reportmeasures (e.g., NIH PhenX Tool Kit). In step 2, we will compare these multilevel factors across three patientgroups: Group 1- patients who tested positive and received follow-up care and/or services; Group 2- patientswho tested positive but did not receive follow-up care and/or services; and Group 3- patients who were eligiblefor testing (based on symptoms and probable exposure), but did not get tested. In step 3, we will employpredictive modeling to correctly identify patients at high-risk (group 3). In Phase 2, we will combine data fromthe previous phase with qualitative data (i.e., ethnographic observations, document analyses, and focus groupswith FHC staff, providers, administrators, patients and community members) to capture organizational (e.g., FHCstaff/provider attitudes and communications with patients, organizational culture) and ethical issues (e.g., datatransparency and privacy) to shed light on important social, cultural, and contextual factors associated withuptake of COVID-19 testing and potential vaccine. Finally, in Phase 3, in collaboration with our CommunityOversight Task Force, we will integrate Phase 1 and 2 data to refine, test, and disseminate tailored toolkits andethical governance guidelines (e.g. clinical trials transparency and data privacy). These toolkits will be designedto increase knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 testing and vaccine research and will be widelydisseminated among the FHCs, local community, NYULH, and the RADx-UP Coordination and Data CollectionCenter.","1, 8, 9","1d, 8c, 8f, 9a, 9c"
C12502,National COVID-19 Wastewater Epidemiology Surveillance Programme,"Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) requires relatively few resources compared to the systematic testing of populations. WBE is especially promising for novel infectious diseases, where asymptomatic cases might play a significant role in transmitting the virus. However, WBE is only now being used to monitor the spread of a pandemic infectious disease.  Early studies by ourselves and others have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be recovered from wastewater, including from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) preceding local COVID-19 hospitalisation activity. Given the challenge of making available diagnostic tests to the entire UK population, WBE represents a potentially low-cost and immediate mechanism for understanding levels of infection within large geographic areas. N-WESP aims to compare our methods with those of European & North American WBE teams in an inter-lab trial for understanding, supporting and improving the DEFRA COVID-19 measurements which will feed into the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). We will also compare methods with DEFRA, the EA's and JBC whilst they explore options for finer geographical measurements. N-WESP will empower public health authorities with an optimised surveillance tool with maximal sensitivity and predictive power whose uncertainties have been well characterised. N-WESP will determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and sludge is infectious, and to what extent there might be downstream risks to human health. N-WESP will exploit catchment and, uniquely, sub-catchment-scale longitudinal surveillance to understand temporal and spatial heterogeneity, relationships to human disease burden distribution and whether there is potential outbreak 'hotspots' by surveilling sewer system nodes.","1, 3","1f, 3a"

C19623,Developing integrated guidelines for health care workers in hospital and primary healthcare facilities in response to Covid-19 pandemic in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs),"The proposal responds to the CIHR call regarding public health responses to the 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. We recognise the gap in LMICs where there is an under financed health system and low capacity of health care workers (HCWs) in hospitals, public and private primary care facilities and the community/ NGO to respond to the pandemic.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced technical guidance, but the guidance documents are broad, they have to be updated with new developments, and translated into guidelines for HCWs, i.e., doctors, nurses and community health workers for hospitals, primary care and community in LMICs. Here we choose the Philippines and Sri Lanka because they both reported Covid-19 cases, and we can quickly mobilize resources.  We aim to develop an integrated plan for HCWs to respond to the pandemic, as well as role-specific guidelines to manage Covid-19 suspects and cases regarding hospital patient flow, infection control, patient supervision and support in communities. We will learn from frontline experiences in China and update our understanding. We will work with policymakers, HCWs and NGOs in the Philippines and Sri Lanka to develop the guidelines and training modules.  We will pilot test the tools for feasibility and acceptability among HCWs in the Philippines, adapt in Sri Lanka, and generate a generic version for LMICs to respond to Covid-19 and any future similar pandemic. Our integrated response strategy aims to update skills of HCWs, reduce patient overload at hospitals, avoid hospital transmission, reduce community transmission and public panic, provide patient support and reduce stigma. Our professional team consists of researchers from Canada, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The team has strong related experience and can quickly produce a draft guideline and materials within 2 months and finalize all work in 24 months.",11,11f

C07346,"Recovering from COVID-19: Informing, supporting and developing guidance for local resilience","Recovery is ""the process of rebuilding, restoring and rehabilitating the community following an emergency"" (HMG Emergency Response and Recovery, 2013). For COVID-19, recovery will involve all-of society (because everyone in the country has been affected to some extent) and whole-system (because every organisation, service and function has been affected). Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we have deployed our research expertise in emergency response and recovery to support government. This has involved providing ongoing information about recovery, producing rapid response guides on aspects of response and recovery, and identifying opportunities for research to support the recovery effort. This project builds on this initial work to understand how government develop plans for short-term, transactional 'recovery' and how they think strategically about longer-term, ambitious, transformational change which we call 'renewal'. Objective: This project works closely with resilience partners in three Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) to develop a generalizable, theoretically underpinned framework for how recovery and renewal to COVID-19 can enhance resilience. The framework will: - Take a whole system approach to recovery and renewal (from communities to national levels) - Explore how to manage the changes in people, places and processes that is needed to live with COVID-19 - Address short-term, transactional recovery as well as longer-term, transformational renewal  - Complement existing guidance and resilience standards and inform an international standard that we will write on recovery and renewal Approach: The framework will be informed by (and inform) Recovery Coordination Groups (RCGs) by using an action research approach to work closely with the resilience partners and engage with local and national organisations on how they plan recovery and renewal on a system-wide basis. Our partner LRFs have different structures (e.g. for local governance and recovery governance) and characteristics (e.g. partnerships, priorities, populations, local challenges, inequalities) so we can create a framework that is widely applicable to local variations. Activities: We will: - Collect and analyse national/international lessons on recovery and renewal - Gather primary data by interviewing experts across the world on emergency planning, risk, and resilience - Contribute to three Recovery Coordination Groups (RCGs) as well as three specific renewal projects (e.g. on volunteering, community resilience, demand management in emergency services) - Extensively engage with other local and national government organisations to ensure alignment of our framework and exploit ongoing opportunities for impact - Facilitate webinars and training on recovery and renewal for resilience - Develop and test a framework for recovery and renewal, refine it in different contexts (national and international), learn about its application, and use feedback to improve it - Develop and test a methodology to assess the impact of the framework Main deliverables:   - A searchable database of lessons for recovery and renewal for local resilience - Expert briefings on how to implement recovery and renewal for resilience - A generalizable, theoretically underpinned, practice-tested framework to support government's thinking about recovery and renewal for resilience - A self-evaluation methodology to reflect on recovery practices - Publish fortnightly 'The Manchester Briefing on Recovery and Renewal' currently distributed directly (and through a network of national/international partners) to 52,000 people along with case studies and training products  - International and national standards having a global impact",10,10y
C13814,A double blind randomized trial of low-dose naltrexone for post-covid fatigue syndrome,"This study aims to determine whether low-dose naltrexone (LDN) improves energy and reduces fatigue and pain in people who had COVID-19 (i.e. confirmed SARS-COV-2 positive) and have persistent symptoms of fatigue post-viral infection (PVI). Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) refers to naltrexone given in doses of 1-4.5 mg. Naltrexone is a medication that has been used in the treatment of excessive alcohol and opioids and for some types of itchiness. It has also been used, in low doses, for the relief of symptoms related to fibromyalgia (FM) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The medication works differently when used in low doses compared to in high doses. Previous studies in people with FM found a significantly greater reduction in pain among those taking LDN compared to those taking placebo. Overall, the studies found that LDN is safe, well-tolerated, may reduce inflammation, and improves general health and psychological well-being.  The proposed trial will be conducted at the Complex Chronic Diseases Program (CCDP), the provincial reference centre for treating ME/CFS and FM in British Columbia. The CCDP clinic has extensive experience in treating cases of FM and ME/CFS with LDN. We propose a placebo-controlled double-blind trial using LDN to treat patients with persistent symptoms of fatigue following SARS-COV-2 infection. We will find out whether people taking the medication show a reduction in symptom severity, such as sustained fatigue and pain, and improved quality of life. Individuals referred to as 'Long-haulers' or 'Long-COVID' currently do not have well researched drug interventions to treat their fatigue and related symptoms. The proposed study will demonstrate whether LDN is a medication that could benefit a large number of people with post-covid-19 fatigue illness. Furthermore, if this trial proves successful, it would lend support for further studies exploring LDN in other forms of post-viral fatigue, ME/CFS and FM populations.","4, 6","4d, 6g, 6h"
C19847,The Next Steps for Childhood Vaccination: Community and Expert Consultation in Addressing Reductions in Childhood Vaccination Access and Uptake Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic for Kids New to Canada,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed children's formative years, including their schooling, social opportunities, and health. Routine childhood vaccinations (RCVs) protect children against life-changing illnesses. Kids new to Canada often have incomplete vaccinations as RCV is not part of routine immigration medical examination, the Canadian schedule differs from the WHO schedule, and documentation practices vary. Combined with recent reductions in access to primary care clinics, pharmacies, and schools, these factors may put this group at higher risk of not having access to or not wanting RCVs.  We aim to examine this pandemic's effects on access to RCVs, attitudes about RCVs, and vaccination-seeking behaviours-specifically for kids new to Canada (in the past five years). Our study will have three components: 1.Environmental scan and scoping review: examining current knowledge of how the pandemic has affected RCV uptake, access, knowledge, and attitudes. This will also include interventions that jurisdictions have begun to implement to address these gaps. 2.Primary data collection: surveys, focus groups, and interviews involving key stakeholders (newcomers, public health, school boards, community organizations) to understand how the pandemic has affected RCV uptake, knowledge, and attitudes. We will also utilize administrative data. 3.Identifying potential interventions: we will identify potential interventions to improve RCV uptake in conjunction with discussion with stakeholders so that they may implement them alongside governmental organizations. Getting this population on track with RCVs will require strategies that are practical and agreeable to those impacted by them. The process of creating these plans will ensure fairness in the planned projects, the behavioural changes sought, and the goals of improved public health. We expect that this process will help to determine what types of interventions may be most beneficial now and in future public health crises.","10, 9","10a, 9e"

P21486,West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV), as well as rodent- and  bat-borne viruses such as Lassa fever and probably Ebola, are among the most important causes of emerging  infectious diseases, and many circulate enzootically in W. Africa. The mechanisms whereby these and other  zoonotic African viruses emerge and spread remain obscure, along with the understanding of their disease  burden and varied clinical outcomes. The West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases will address  these critical gaps through field studies of enzootic transmission, and clinical studies of human exposure and  disease outcome. Our surveillance of humans, and wild animals, including bats (probable hosts of filoviruses,  coronaviruses and henipaviruses), and mosquitoes/ticks, will likely identify new emerging viral pathogens.  Further, the infrastructure and local expertise developed through these projects in Senegal, Sierra Leone and  Nigeria, along with biosafety/biosecurity training and improved diagnostics, will also prepare the region for  future outbreaks of emerging viral and other infectious diseases. The CenterÃ¢Â€Â™s aims are to:  1. Study zoonotic arboviruses in Senegal, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, including identification and   characterization of critical reservoir and amplification hosts, enzootic and epidemic vectors, temporal   patterns of enzootic and epidemic circulation, levels of human exposure, immune responses and disease   outcomes. The emphasis will be on the 4 Ã¢Â€ÂœurbanÃ¢Â€Â (human amplified) arboviruses: CHIKV, DENV, YFV and   ZIKV, but other known and possibly unknown viruses will also be studied. Risk maps will be generated.  2. In Sierra Leone and Nigeria, study the circulation among rodent hosts and infections of humans by Lassa   virus, including identification of viral determinants of hemorrhagic disease severity and sequelae outcomes,   and determination of the mechanisms of strain virulence variation. Risk maps will also be generated.  3. Perform surveillance in bats to identify potential sources of Ebola virus in W. Africa as well as other known   or unknown zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses and henipaviruses that may be causing human   disease, and which may explain the origins of emerging pathogens such as Nipah and MERS coronavirus.  4. Establish biocontainment and biosecurity training programs, advanced yet affordable viral genomics   capabilities, and comprehensive diagnostics to support these aims as well as to improve research   infrastructure and future outbreak responses in W. Africa.  Our results will increase the mechanistic understanding of zoonotic viral maintenance and emergence,  etiologies of febrile and hemorrhagic diseases, diverse disease outcomes, and risks for local and international  spread. Novel viruses with emergence potential will likely be discovered, and existing collaborations between  the Univ. of TX Medical Branch and its partners in Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, as well as research  infrastructure, will be strengthened to prepare for and respond quickly and effectively to future outbreaks.","2, 3, 4","2a, 2b, 3a, 4b"

C06800,Metallothionein 1E as a Central Regulator of Human Pancreatic Beta Cell Function and Survival,"Abstract.COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID19 is caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the coronaviridae, a diverse family ofviruses that cause a range of diseases in humans and animals. Recent clinical studies show a strong associationwith COVID-19 and diabetes. Additional studies suggest that diabetes is not only a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease but also that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce a new onset diabetes. However, it is not clear whatdiabetes-associated cells are infected by the virus and how these cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection.A number of studies support the hypothesis that viral infections play a causative role in Type 1 diabetes (T1D).Enterovirus isolates obtained from newly diagnosed T1D patients can infect and destroy human islet cells in vitro.In T1D patients, beta cell mass decreases due to auto-immune destruction. Here, we assemble a multi-disciplinary investigator team, including expert beta cell biologist (Dr. Chen), stem cell biologists (Drs. Evans andSchwartz), and a virologist (Dr. tenOever) to systematically study the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pancreaticendocrine cells and test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes human pancreatic endocrine celldestruction. In preliminary studies, we found that human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived pancreaticendocrine cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was further validated using adult primary humanislets. Transcript profiling following SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived pancreatic endocrine cells revealedstriking upregulation of chemokines, similar to profiles of tissues obtained after autopsy of COVID-19 patients.In addition, we performed two high content chemical screens and identified several FDA-approved drugs thatshow anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities on both hPSC-derived colonic and lung organoids. Here, we propose tovalidate the SARS-CoV-2 infection using pancreatic samples from COVID-19 patients, examine the impact ofSARS-CoV-2 infection on human endocrine cells, and re-purpose FDA-approved drugs to protect humanpancreatic endocrine cells from SRAS-CoV-2 infection. Three aims are proposed:Aim 1. Validate SARS-CoV-2 infection in pancreatic samples from post-mortem COVID-19 patients.Aim 2. Examine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human pancreatic endocrine cell function and survival.Aim 3. Repurpose FDA-approved drugs to protect human pancreatic endocrine cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection.Through this study, we expect to provide direct pathogenic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of humanpancreatic endocrine cells, understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infected pancreatic endocrine cells,and develop novel approaches to protect human endocrine cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","4, 6","4b, 6g"

Yet many Canadians lack access to mental health care services, with equity in access a key concern for specific groups due to gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, geographic isolation, and immigration status issues. The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating mental health challenges and widening service gaps, especially among those in marginalized groups and those with pre-existing mental health issues, making it a critical time to provide tools that will improve mental health at the population level.  Wellness Together Canada (WTC) was created in response to this unprecedented rise in mental health and substance use concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with funding from the Government of Canada. It is a mental health and substance use website to support people across Canada providing digital interventions and services at no cost.

The lower vaccination rate among residents in Parc Extension is attributable to vaccine hesitancy, characterized by uncertainty and ambivalence about vaccination, a legitimate viewpoint, underscoring the failure or lack of an effective public health system. In response, new and reimagined vaccine interventions that are community-led, culturally-relevant, and place-based have been developed in Parc Extension to successfully increase vaccine confidence and uptake. There is a clear need for better quality studies on the use of community-led vaccination strategies in promoting confidence, particularly in low income and diverse regions in Canada, where research capacities are limited. This proposed community-based research has the fundamental goal of producing qualitative evidence guided by grounded theory using Parc Extension, Québec as a case study in understanding dynamic community-led responses and developing a best practices implementation toolkit to address vaccine hesitancy. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with diverse key stakeholders in Parc Extension to understand the best practices required to establish successful and effective community-led vaccine strategies.

School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional,social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened forchildren with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effectivehand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and schoolstaff in order to safely return to school. Members of our research team have developed an innovative, scalable,low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington UniversityIntellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with theUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute inMaryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the KennedyKrieger School Programs), are ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximizeuse of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting.The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County,whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centerson Disabilities (AUCD). First, we will determine the most effective messaging and implementation strategies tomaximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, we will administer 52,000diagnostic tests to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black. Second, we willmeasure national attitudes among parents/guardians of children with IDD and school staff regarding the impactof COVID-19 and the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing. At the successful completion of this project, we willhave improved the acceptance, adoption, and process for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing in a school-basedsetting to enable delivery of critical educational activities for children with IDD in an underserved community.

C17762,Autophagy represents a new host-pathogen interface for identification of infectious bronchitis virus proteins that determine virulence,"Infectious bronchitis is an important endemic disease of chickens and caused by the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Poultry meat is an important food source and during the course of a year approximately 40 x 109 chickens are reared globally. The increasing demand for poultry meat has lead to the introduction intensive farming methods but productivity is often limited by infectious diseases which spread rapidly through high density chicken populations. Importantly for this proposal, a report sponsored by the UK government published in 2005 (http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/Project_Data/Document Library/ZZ0102/ZZ0102 1215_FRP.doc) revealed that the number one cause of economic loss in the UK poultry industry resulting from infectious diseases of chickens was caused by IBV. The virus is not only responsible for respiratory disease, but also causes damage to the kidneys and to egg producing organs of hens, affecting both the production and quality of eggs. Despite the availability of live and inactivated vaccines, IBV continues to be a major problem. The virus causes high morbidity, is ubiquitous world wide, and endemic in the UK, and shows extensive antigenic variation and short lived immunity. These factors lead to high rates of infection and poor cross-protection following infection or vaccination.    Most vaccines are given to poultry by spray or in drinking water. Both approaches are rather hit-and-miss. The 'holy grail' of vaccine developers is to have vaccines that can be given by robotic machine to chicks before they hatch. Unfortunately, no existing IB vaccine can be given in ovo because the viruses stop the chicks hatching. One means of controlling IBV is to have a systematic way of generating live attenuated vaccines that provide protection against virulent strains. The reverse genetics necessary for the modification or removal of genes associated with virulence from IBV has been developed by the coronavirus group at the IAH Compton. Together with DEFRA and Intervet International, a major commercial vaccine developer, the IAH coronavirus group are manipulating the genes of IBV to get an optimum balance between attenuation of virulence and capacity to induce immunity.    To apply this technology to the rational design of live vaccines it is now necessary to identify genes that contribute to IBV virulence, and understand how they function. Importantly for this proposal, recent work on mammalian coronaviruses, and work on the avian IBV coronavirus at Compton, suggests that virulence may be determined by the way in which cells control virus replication. We have produced IBVs that do not make a series of small proteins called 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b. These viruses grow normally in cell culture and allow chicks to hatch after inoculation in ovo. This shows that we can attenuate IBV by removing non-essential genes, but this is an empirical process because we do not know how the 3(ab) and 5(ab) proteins function in the context of virulence.     The purpose of the present grant application to BBSRC is to establish the science behind the empirical observations that we are making. Experiments underpinning this proposal have shown that virulence of IBV may be associated with proteins that control replication, and that these proteins associate with membranes in cells that have the potential to destroy the virus before it can leave the cell. We now want to understand how the replicase proteins avoid destruction, and in this way determine virulence. This will enable us to fine tune our mutants to make viruses that survive long enough to infect chicks 'in ovo', and induce an immune response, but are too weak to harm the chicks and prevent them from hatching.",1,1b

Characterizing responses toCOVID-19 infection in AD patients may guide the way these patients are treated, and inform on whethertreatments need to be modified or discontinued in the instance of asymptomatic or symptomatic infections.Although some studies have shown that Th2 cytokines (among other cytokines) are elevated in severely illpatients admitted to ICUs with pneumonia secondary to COVID-19, no efforts have been published thus farevaluating the role of Th2 inflammation in severity of symptoms and outcomes in patients with COVID-19.Furthermore, the incidence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms among patients receiving Th2 blockade foratopic dermatitis with dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4/IL-13 signaling IL-4R receptor alphasubunit, has not been evaluated. It has long been believed that abnormally elevated Th2-axis polarization inthe setting of AD and asthma patients may negatively impact the ability of the immune system to induceappropriate Th1 response, as evidenced by the higher rate of viral infections in these patients. Also, as AfricanAmericans seem to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19, understanding if there are ethnic differencesin mounting COVID-19 responses in the setting of systemic and biologic treatments (i.e dupilumab), is crucial.This study is in scope to the parent award (RFA-AI-19-015), as we are an ADRN clinical site, and this studyfocuses on understanding COVID-19 in AD patients with different phenotypes based on ethnicity, treatmentand severity. We are requesting an administrative supplement under NOT-AI-20-031 to support this project. The hypothesis of this study is that Th2 blockade preferentially promotes a Th1-skewed anti-viralimmune response, leading to decreased or asymptomatic clinical severity with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19infection. The aims of this study are: 1) To evaluate the incidence and severity of COVID-19 among patientscurrently treated for AD dupilumab (as compared to a group of AD patients treated with broad oral immunesuppressants); 2) To evaluate whether African American patients with AD on dupilumab have milder symptomsin the setting of COVID-19 compared to African American patients treated with other immune suppressants,and whether there are differences in mounting viral responses between patients of different ethnicities treatedwith dupilumab; 3) To evaluate and characterize immune responses in AD patients with reported symptoms ofCOVID-19 on dupilumab and other broad immunosuppressants using proteomic and transcriptomicapproaches.","1, 3","1d, 3b"
C01102,Covid -19; Cancer attitudes and Behaviour Study,"Background: The impact of COVID-19 on UK public attitudes towards cancer is likely to be considerable, translating in to impact on the NHS from delayed referrals, missed screening and later-stage cancer diagnosis.  Aim: To generate rapid evidence based on public views/response, informaing public health interventions to encourage timely symptom presentation, screening engagement and cancer- related health behaviours in the wake of the panedmic.  Design: Prospective mixed-methods cohort study in the UK population.  Methods: During June-August 2020, and again six months later, we will conduct a UK-Wide population survey of adults aged 18+ measuring attitudes and behaviour in the domains of cancer symptom presentation, screening, smoking, alcohol, diet and physical activity.  We will sample from established online cohorts, supplemented with social media recruitment.  Qualitative interviews will be conducted with survey participants to understand the contextual influences on cancer attitudes and behaviour.  Using existing linked data, we will assess primary care referrals and investigations for suspected cancer symptoms, screening, smoking cessation and number/stage of new cancers diagnosed in the Welsh cohort.  Analysis: Multivariable modelling will be used to assess determinants of symptom presentation (primary analysis), screening and health behaviours, and to identify longitudinal predictors of health service use and cancer outcomes.  Qualitative data will be analysed thematically, with triangulation of data sources.  Outputs: We will provide rapid recommendations to drive tailored public health initiatives for cancer early detection and prevention in the pandemic recovery period. Longer-term, the study will lay the foundations for assessing policy impact in response to future global health threats.","10, 11","10a, 11a"

P23225,"SBIR, Phase I (R43): Ultrasensitive Lateral Flow Assays Enabled by Fluorescent Nanodiamond Labels","Summary. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) providing rapid on-site detection of medically significant analytes could  be extremely valuable for high-volume, high-speed population screening necessary to minimize the economic  and societal impact of epidemic outbreaks. However, LFA performance has been mostly limited to colorimetric  binary diagnostics, primarily providing yes/no testing for clinically relevant analytes present at high  concentrations (Ã'ÂµM-nM) and cannot satisfy sensitivity requirements for reliable virus detection (fM-aM) which is  presently achieved only using laboratory techniques (ELISA, PCR). Though signal amplification through  fluorescence has steadily gained traction to improve sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude in comparison with  standard colorimetric tests, the inherent autofluorescence of materials used to construct LFA test strips interferes  with test performance and introduces variability. By enabling rapid, attomolar sensitivity, fluorescence-based  LFAs could facilitate a revolutionary shift in the analytical capability of point-of-care tests to provide quantitative  actionable data to inform health authorities to launch timely responses. The pathway to this development involves  advancement of the fluorescence detection system and material properties of the reporters. This proposal aims  to strategically address both of these directions by advancing a recently emerged LFA platform based on  fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) reporters. FNDs possess ideal features for an LFA reporter such as bright non-  bleaching fluorescence and unsurpassed ruggedness. A prototype using FND as a novel LFA reporter was  recently demonstrated by Debina Diagnostics in detecting Ebola virus glycoprotein at the picograms level, using  a custom-made optoelectronic reader (Axxin, Inc.) and off-the-shelf 200 nm FND produced by AdÃƒÂ¡mas  Nanotechnologies. The most striking attribute of FND envisioned to improve FND-based LFA sensitivity by 2-3  orders of magnitude arises from the uniquely coupled magneto-optical properties of the particles, where nitrogen-  vacancy (NV) color centers with an electron spin allow the intensity FND fluorescence to be modulated by an  external magnetic field. Based on this unique property, the FND-related signal can be separated from  background autofluorescence in the frequency domain through lock-in analysis which is widely used in signal  processing to extract small periodic signals present below noise levels. Lock-in signal processing of FND can  allow up to 100x increase in sensitivity, as was demonstrated in bioimaging including recent results in LFA.  AdÃƒÂ¡mas recently developed a method further increasing magnetic modulation contrast by 3-5 folds. In this  proposal, AdÃƒÂ¡mas and Debina join their efforts to tailor FND material properties in order to eliminate non-specific  retention of particles on the LFA strip by modifying their physical (shape, size) and chemical (coating) properties,  while optimizing brightness and magneto-optical properties (aim 1). After implementation and optimization of the  lock-in analysis including interfacing the set-up with the opto-electronic reader (aim 2), we aim to demonstrate  >300x improvement in LOD of Ebola virus antigen and <1pg LOD for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (aim 3).",1,1a

Through networking activities, training and coordinated actions, BRAINN will develop an innovative applied neuroscience approach to characterise the effects of COVID-19 on brain health and to elevate the standards of assessment, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of patients with mental health and cognitive problems due to COVID-19. The UM, KCL and UGent teams have complementary world-renowned expertise in neuroimaging, non-invasive neurostimulation and digitalised assessment methods, extensive research management experience and active interest in post-COVID research. Engaging these teams as partners will provide the required mentoring and training towards a focused and systematic approach to neuroscience research in a mutually beneficial manner to raise the research profile of UCY, as well as strengthen the research management and administrative skills of UCY staff. BRAINN will benefit all partners, as the standardisation of assessment and treatment protocols will expedite data collection and will safeguard the sustainability and future expansion of the network. Through interdisciplinary research and development of novel methods and technologies, BRAINN will contribute to personalised treatments, bringing both UCY and Cyprus to the scientific forefront. Additionally, BRAINN will address the brain drain challenge that has increased in Cyprus over the recent years and contribute to the reduction in the burden created by COVID-19.

C03134,Remote cognitive assessment in severe mental illness: A scoping review,"Schizophrenia and related psychoses are arguably the most serious of all mental disorders, imposing enormous burden on individuals, families, and communities. In addition to symptom recurrence or relapse and deterioration in social functioning, most individuals also present with cognitive impairments (difficulties in verbal memory, executive functioning, attention). These impairments represent important psychological intervention targets. Specifically, cognitive remediation therapy(CRT) and meta-cognitive training (MCT) have been shown to improve these cognitive dimensions, in addition to psychotic symptoms, insight, and self-esteem. Brain imaging evidence additionally suggests that CRT and MCT improve brain function. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant barrier to accessing mental health services, which increases risk of relapse, ER visits, and hospitalizations. Hence, we are working to deliver these psychological interventions remotely using digital mental health technology. We plan to conduct a scoping review of the current literature on remote cognitive assessment to determine best practices in this field. To achieve this, we propose to: 1) map the current knowledge on remote cognitive assessment for severe mental illness; 2) identify potential barriers and facilitators; and 3) compare knowledge regarding remote cognitive assessment for severe mental illness with neurological and geriatric populations. Our national collaborative initiative is intended as a rapid response to the COVID-19 situation for populations with serious mental illness. Our scoping review will facilitate the work of researchers, clinicians, and policy makers whose aim is to develop digital health and technology-based interventions for cognitive health. Our findings will be widely available to the Canadian community, as we will establish a knowledge-user and stakeholder consultation group comprised of organizational leaders, patients, and caregiver representatives.",10,10a

C09836,Impact on the mental health of the pandemic of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the participants of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brazil) of the state of São Paulo,"In late 2019, a new pathogen called SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as ""COVID-19"" or ""new coronavirus"") was identified in Wuhan, China. The disease spread rapidly around the world, being characterized as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Twenty percent of patients with this infection have severe or critical forms, particularly in those with advanced age or comorbidities. With the exponential increase in new cases and deaths associated with COVID-19, intensive quarantine measures were adopted. In Brazil, the state of São Paulo is the region that most registers cases of the disease and deaths, leading the government to decree quarantine across the state in the last week of March 2020. Faced with this scenario of social distance and home isolation, innumerable psychiatric and psychological repercussions can occur. In this context, we propose a prospective study to assess the psychiatric and psychological repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic in the 4150 participants in the Longitudinal Study on Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) followed at the São Paulo Research Center, in 4 evaluations to be carried out during the pandemic, online. The questionnaire will assess, using self-applicable scales, depressive and anxious symptoms, suicide, increased stress, protective factors and risk factors of this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, participants with self-rated mental health as ""poor"" will be invited to participate in a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and safety of group vs. group psychotherapy. supervised group activities (""iPsico program""), via call center, in the reduction of depressive and anxious symptoms.

C06658,1)MVA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"The overall goal of this proposal is to develop effective prophylactic vaccines against the novel SARSCoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that has recently emerged as a pandemic across the world. The SARSCoV-2 has already infected more than 120,000 people and over 4000 people died due to COVID-19, a diseasecaused by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a vaccine that can rapidly induceanti-viral immunity and prevent infection. Previous data from other related coronavirus infections such as SARSCoV and MERS-CoV demonstrate that a strong neutralizing antibody response against the spike protein caneffectively prevent infection. Thus, a primary goal of this proposal is to develop a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)based vaccine that expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to generate a rapid and strong neutralizing antibodyresponse both in systemic and mucosal compartments. There are several advantages to MVA based vaccinesthat include their excellent safety and a single dose of MVA vaccination can provide protection against multiplevirus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS, Zika and Ebola viruse. A novel aspect of this proposal is that wewill compare the immunogenicity and protective ability of different forms of the spike protein with a goal ofinducing neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. This proposal has two specific aims.The goal of Aim 1 is to generate MVA vaccines and characterizing the anti-spike antibody response in mice. Wewill also compare parenteral (i.m.) vs mucosal (intranasal) vaccinations to determine the best route for inducingmucosal antibody response. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the protective efficacy of the MVA-based SARSCoV2 vaccines. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop and characterize small animal models forevaluating vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV2. Mice have served as an excellent model system to not onlyunderstand immunity to the related SARS virus but also for evaluating vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. In thisAim, we will develop and characterize a mouse model of SARS-CoV2 infection and use this model to test theprotective efficacy of our MVA-based vaccine candidates. The completion of these studies will not only providea mouse model for SARS-CoV2 infection but also develop vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV2.","1, 7","1e, 7a, 7i "
C13765,Risk of Environmental Surface and Air Contamination in COVID-19 Caused by Variant Viruses (RISC-COV-Variants),"COVID-19 is an infection caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. The original form of this virus first emerged in late 2019 and has caused a worldwide pandemic. This virus is transmitted from person to person, usually before or at the beginning of infection, predominantly via large respiratory droplets, although airborne smaller particles, and the contaminated environment may play a role. The best test to detect infection is with a swab of the back of the nose called a nasopharyngeal swab.  Like influenza, this coronavirus changes over time. In influenza, changes in the virus mean that the virus evades immunity, so that previously infected and vaccinated people becoming re-infected. This is likely to occur with SARS-CoV-2 as well. However, the situation with coronaviruses is worse than with influenza: coronaviruses are known for their ability to change many different characteristics. Thus, although we are worried that changes may make vaccine less effective, it is also true that the virus might change how or when it is transmitted, or what the best test for detection is. Our study will take advantage of previous work with COVID-19 by our group, and a network of researchers called the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network (www.tibdn.ca) to ask whether or not new variants of COVID have different characteristics than the original virus.  For a serious of variants of SARS-CoV-2, we will study whether the air and environment around COVID-19 patients is contaminated with virus, what the best diagnostic test for COVID-19 is, and how long people test positive during their illnesses.",1,"1a, 1c, 1f"
P22970,Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,"ABSTRACT  Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted  life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden  of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct  medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become  global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s  population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce  our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current  vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a  given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of  unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu  strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (Ã¢Â€ÂœdecoyÃ¢Â€Â epitopes) that largely stimulate strain-  restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT),  involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the  immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT  approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now  focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental  antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted  process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the  ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using  methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than  previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity Ã¢Â€ÂœstrengthÃ¢Â€Â  scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant  antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose  to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1)  dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the  immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow-  up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for  translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation.",7,7a
C00912,4/7: Longitudinal Evaluation of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on High-risk New and Expectant Mothers,"While the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome has reached a staggering 6.5 per 1,000 births nationwide, theshort- and long-term effects of in-utero opioid exposure are far from clear. We lack fundamental knowledge ofneurotypical neonatal development and struggle to disentangle the effect of opioid exposure from otherprotective and risk factors impacting infant health. The fetal stage of brain development is a critical periodwhen foundational aspects of brain structure and function are being established. In addition, postnatal braindevelopment and specialization are shaped by environmental experiences thus allowing maturation to beinfluenced by lifestyle factors associated with opioid use. This Phase I project will plan for a large scale, multi-site research study to prospectively examine human brain, cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotionaldevelopment beginning prenatally through childhood. The University of Pittsburgh is one of four linked sitesincluding Oregon Health and Sciences University, New York University and the University of Vermont that willaddress key challenges critical to the success of the planned Phase II study. Aim 1 will develop, implementand evaluate innovative recruitment and retention strategies for high-risk populations through a longitudinalsurvey of 150 pregnant women per site (n=600 across sites), half of whom are opioid using. Aim 2 willimplement a multi-site, standardized, longitudinal research protocol by enrolling 20 pregnant women per site(n=80 across sites), half of whom are opioid using. This prospective longitudinal study will collect fetal andneonatal multimodal MRI, biospecimens, and maternal psychosocial and health assessments. Aim 3 willevaluate data acquisition, processing, and statistical considerations to maximize data quality, usability, andintegration across sites. We will test the efficacy of (A) real-time motion monitoring/quality assessment forimproving overall data quality and (B) time-savings versus MRI quality using new acceleration sequenceprotocols. This approach will inform and set a strong foundation for a comprehensive and effective Phase IIresearch plan. The University of Pittsburgh site is led by a highly productive, NIH-funded investigative teamwith multidisciplinary expertise in substance use (Krans, Bogen), pregnancy (Krans), and fetal, neonatal, andpediatric neuroimaging (Luna, Panigrahy). Specifically, our team has established study protocols that yieldexcellent recruitment (~76%) and retention (~74%) rates among opioid using pregnant women, has substantialexperience with imaging the immature brain (fetal/neonatal) and is a leader in developmental cognitiveneuroscience using multimodal imaging to investigate neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitivedevelopment through adolescence.

P22964,Biomimetic nanoparticles to enhance the breadth of influenza vaccines,"Abstract  Current influenza (flu) vaccines are effective only for closely matched flu viral strains and must be updated  annually to address constant antigenic shift/drifts of surface hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) of  the virus. Even with annual update, there have been years in which flu vaccines were ineffective due to  significant differences in antigenicity of HA and/or NA between the strains used for preparing the vaccines and  the circulating ones, leaving us at high risk of pandemics in case a new and highly pathological virus emerges.  It is without any doubt that a Ã¢Â€ÂœUniversalÃ¢Â€Â flu vaccine that can protect against both seasonal (matched or  mismatched) and pandemic flu viruses is urgently needed, but it remains Ã¢Â€Âœan alchemistÃ¢Â€Â™s dreamÃ¢Â€Â so far. We  developed a novel adjuvant by encapsulation of cGAMP, an agonist of the stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene  (STING), into pulmonary surfactant (PS)-biomimetic liposomes (PS-GMNP). The adjuvant, alongside an  inactivated flu vaccine, robustly stimulated humoral and CD8+ T cell immune responses that resemble those  ocurring during the early phase of viral infection both in magnitude and in dynamics. Strikingly, a single dose of  PS-GMNP-adjuvant flu vaccine elicited strong cross-protection against a lethal challenge of diverse  heterosubtypic flu A viruses as early as 2 days after immunization. While stimulating robust heterosubtypic  immunity, the adjuvant did not cause any adverse events in lung histology, body weight or temperature, in  sharp contrast to the severe lung inflammation and death caused by flu viral infection. In this proposal, we will  investigate the cellular and humoral immune responses essential to the cross-protection induced by PS-  GMNP-adjuvanted flu vaccines. Specifically, we will determine whether PS-GMNP can expand cross-reactive  CD8+ T cells and induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), pivotal to PS-GMNP-induced cross-  protection. In Aim 2, we will preclude any adverse effects of pre-existing immunity on the adjuvanticity of PS-  GMNP and extend the cross-protection to pre-pandemic wild type H5N1 and H7N9 viruses to establish its  clinical potentials. Distinguished from conventional adjuvants that activate primarily antigen-presenting cells  (APCs), cGAMP delivered by PS-GMNP activated both alveolar macrophages (aMÃ‰Â¸) and alveolar epithelial  cells (AEC), which can be crucial since similar activation of these two types of cells is also observed during flu  viral infection. Two alternative approaches will be employed in Aim 3 to corroborate indispensable function of  AEC and/or aMÃ‰Â¸ in PS-GMNP-mediated heterosubtypic immunity, including a blockade of cell-gap junctions  and generation of chimeric mice of wild type and STING-deficient bone marrow (BM) cells. The study, if  successful, could provide invaluable information about clinical potentials for PS-GMNP to widen the breadth of  existing flu vaccines toward a Ã¢Â€ÂœUniverseÃ¢Â€Â one, which will have a huge and immediate impact on global health.","1, 7","1d,7a"
C07127,Northwestern Genomic Risk Assessment and Management Program,"PROJECT Summary: Since early 2020, COVID-19 disease spread rapidly across the US and will likely be sustained or recur periodically until an effective vaccine or prophylactic treatment is developed.

C10625,Acceptability and Impact of a Prenatal Internet Intervention for Promoting Maternal Mental Health in the COVID-19 Context,"Pregnancy and the postpartum are known periods when mothers are at heightened risk for psychological distress, including elevated depression, anxiety and stress. With the COVID-19 outbreak concerns related to fear of infection, maternal and infant health, financial stresses and social isolation resulting from extraordinary public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 are likely to exponentially increase psychological distress in expectant mothers. A strong body of research has shown that even mild to moderate maternal emotional distress during pregnancy adversely impacts mothers and their offspring. Given the likely increase in emotional distress experienced by pregnant women during the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to promote the mental health of pregnant women with programs that can be delivered remotely. Out team has been ahead of the curve in recognizing the need for developing evidence based online care strategies. We have developed a bilingual prototype website entitled HealthyMoms which is comprised of accurate and understandable information on the impact of stress, depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Tools to promote emotional well-being and healthy behaviours during pregnancy are provided. The present COVID-19 crisis and the expected mental health fallout from the crisis presents an important opportunity to evaluate the potential of our online platform to address the mental health needs of pregnant women and reduce the risk of perinatal depression.

BACKGROUND: In the UK, over 60,000 adults each year receive invasive ventilation on an intensive care unit. Whilst this is a life-saving interventions, patients often experience long-term physical, psychological and social impacts on their lives. There is an urgent need to identify strategies that can be implemented easily and quickly to reduce the need for intubation. COVID-19 studies show that awake prone positioning reduces the need for tracheal intubation.     AIM:   To conduct a multi-centre, pragmatic, individual patient randomised, open-label, parallel group trial, and economic evaluation to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an awake prone position strategy, compared with standard NHS care.    OBJECTIVES:   (1) Conduct an internal pilot study to confirm the feasibility of the large-scale multi-centre trial;   (2) Determine the clinical effectiveness of awake prone positioning, in relation to requiring tracheal intubation, for hospitalised adults with hypoxaemic respiratory failure;   (3) Estimate, in an integrated economic evaluation, the cost-effectiveness of an awake prone positioning strategy.    METHODS:  Setting: NHS acute hospitals (all acute and critical care settings) across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.  Randomisation: Allocation concealed, randomisation (1:1 ratio), stratified by hospital site.

C00046,Rapid development of antiviral compounds to fight the COVID-19 outbreak [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"The outbreak of a respiratory illness (COVID-19) in China at the end of December 2019 has been demonstrated to be caused by a new coronavirus. While health officials are using quarantine methods to try and prevent the spread of the infection, there are currently no treatments for the illness, which can be severe and even lead to death in 2% of cases. Here, we propose to build on our previous research with viruses of the same family, which include those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We have previously successfully engineered small proteins capable of blocking the activity of an enzyme of the virus that is crucial for its replication and for shutting down the human immune response. We plan on using a similar strategy to build blockers of the new virus. These will be extremely useful in better understanding the biology of the virus. Most importantly, we will use these blocking proteins to find chemical drug candidates that block the activity of the viral enzyme in infected cells, which can then be developed as therapeutics. Our method is rapid and cost efficient, and within the two years of this grant, we expect to have a number of lead candidate drugs. In order to achieve these goals, we have assembled a team of leading scientists with expertise in protein engineering of viral inhibitors (Sachdev Sidhu, University of Toronto), structural biology of viruses (Brian Mark, University of Manitoba), and development of chemical drugs (Roman Melnyk, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto). Our project also has the support of an internationally recognized leader in viral biology (Marjolein Kikkert, Leiden University, Netherlands) and a frontline clinician-scientist in infectious diseases (Samira Mubareka, Sunnybrook Health Centre, Toronto). Ultimately, this work will generate critical tools to better understand this new virus, and most importantly, will provide novel candidate drugs for direly needed therapies.","1, 6","1b, 6a"
C20737,Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19,"Pulmonary infections by viruses such virulent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MeRS) CoV associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Clinically, infections by these viruses are associated with a pronounced lung inflammation, causing respiratory problems that often develop in secondary pneumonia.  Inflammation is the result of immune activation in response to infection.  When activation is too pronounced or sustained for extended periods of time, complications occur.  Two main mediators of inflammation are known: Cytokines and lipid mediators of inflammation (LMI).  In the current proposal we will study the inflammatory response during infection/exposure of lung and blood cells to the newly described COVID-19 and compare this response to that of SARS-CoV-2 and MeRS-CoV to obtain correlates of pathogenicity between these viruses.   We will use primary lung cells and white blood cells from donors to conduct our studies.  The mediators of inflammation will be identified and quantitated using state of the art methodology available in our laboratories.   More than 200 LMI and 150 cytokine/cytokine receptors will be examined.  Upon completion of this proposal, a detailed analysis of the response of primary epithelial cells and leukocytes to COVID-19 will be obtained, enabling the rational design of therapeutic strategies to help combat COVID-19.",4,4b
C19511,First effective pharmacotherapy for ARDS to lower mortality and improve quality of life of patients.,"Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life threatening condition that affects 3 million people world-wide. With regards to the current coronavirus pandemic, ARDS is the immediate cause of death for patients suffering from this infection. 40% of the patients that suffer from the condition succumb to it and among the ones that survive, most of them face long-term physical and mental illness. The unreliable, costly, prolonged treatment options currently available are responsible for the high mortality observed in the condition. The treatments offer only relief from symptoms and manage the condition but are not curative. Exvastat is developing impentri as a reliable and effective pharmacotherapy for ARDS as it targets the cause and trigger of the mortality associated with the condition. It is an intravenous formulation of widely-used chemotherapeutic drug, Imatinib which has shown promising results in-vitro and clinical reports in ARDS like conditions. Being a repurposed drug, Impentri has the advantage of reaching human trials earlier than other drugs. With EIC funds Exvastat plans to register and successfully finish 50% of the PhaseII trials in ARDS patients. This would provide an opening for the drug to successfully finish further trials and its orphan drug status would guarantee early market entry. With Impentri Exvastat wants to lower mortality and provide better quality of life to patients suffering from ARDS",6,6d

P23812,A Whole New Category of Vehicle: The ONO Pedal Assisted Transporter,"Worldwide, e-commerce is booming and parcel delivery and urban logistics have experienced rapid growth. And in light of the current Covid-19 virus pandemic, logistics operators are struggling to cope with the enormous increase in demand as people are confined to their homes, doing their part to slow the virus. This adds to the strain on operators'Äô already present challenges such as polluting vehicles, driver shortages, being stuck in traffic jams, and the lack of flexibility in routing and costs. Yet, delivery methods have hardly evolved in the last 90 years. The time is now to rethink and transform urban logistics.    At ONO, we believed that there was a need for a vehicle that would bring about change in a positive and meaningful way. So, we created a whole new category of vehicle: the ONO Pedal Assisted Transporter (PAT). It'Äôs a unique solution that is meant to improve city life quality by reducing road congestion and air pollution, all while being accessible to all genders. The ONO PAT combines the flexibility and advantages of a bicycle with the durability and cargo capacity of a van. The weather-protected electric vehicle features over 2100 litres of load volume capacity, integrated cargo loading ramps, an easy battery-swapping system, use of quality Tier-1 automotive components, and an aesthetically polished and distinctive design. Our vehicle also features the very unique selling point of having a modular platform base where one unit can be easily swapped for another module.     The scope of this project includes optimising the ONO PAT, and its cargo-unit prototypes for a pre-series production, further developing the technology and software innovations, as well as optimising the business structure needed for commercialisation; preparing and setting-up for manufacturing; setting-up, testing and adjusting our service model ecosystem; testing our pre-series vehicles through fleet deployments; and conducting R&D for additional module-units and a solar roof.",10,"10c, 10d"

C20706,Indoor air quality and the COVID-19 pandemic: using interdisciplinary knowledge translation to reduce transmission of respiratory disease and improve indoor air quality in diverse community spaces in Toronto,"Indoor air quality (IAQ) in community congregate settings, including homeless shelters, drop-in centres, and group homes, has historically been largely ignored by public health authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded this issue, as poor IAQ can result in increased transmission. In addition, public health authorities in Ontario have not provided congregate settings with evidence-based COVID-19 IAQ guidance. The current situation has further exacerbated existing disparities and forced users, workers, and operators to make difficult decisions between receiving/providing essential services and increased risk of infection. The proposed effort addresses the lack of guidance by bringing together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and knowledge translators in partnership with a variety of agencies and individuals that operate and work in community congregate settings. Together, we will build pandemic preparedness and response capacity in the community setting in Toronto through the provision of accessible and practical IAQ guidance to reduce exposure and mitigate transmission. This guidance will address the diversity of buildings and services in the community setting, while taking into account the diversity of perspectives and power dynamics that occur across sectors and in facilities. Specific activities include developing a series of webinars; preparing evidence-based plain language IAQ guidance; authoring high-impact interdisciplinary opinion/editorial articles; training of highly qualified personnel to develop and share IAQ COVID-19 mitigation measures, and the development of a research proposal to address gaps in the evaluation, impact, and implementation of mitigation strategies. Through the process of bringing multidisciplinary researchers, community organizations and workers together, we will build a robust interdisciplinary community of research and practice to address IAQ pandemic preparedness and response in these essential spaces. ",9,9a
P22697,Development of an Integrated Intermediary Metabolomics and Metabolic Flux Core,"Project Summary  This proposal seeks funding for a Liquid Chromatography (LC), Differential Mobility Spectroscopy (DMS),  Quadrupole Time of Flight (LC-DMS-QToF) SCIEX 6600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex LLC, Framingham, MA)  to build an integrated system describing the metabolic traffic in cells, plasma and tissues. The essential  endogenous biochemicals of life are confined to enzymatically delineated metabolic pathways shared across  most species. The collective flow of nutrient substrates into synthetic or catabolic pathways that best describes  key functions, transformations, differentiations, adaptations, or disease processes of a cell, tissue, or organism.  The challenge then is interpreting the flow form concentration data, since the concentration of a metabolite may  have little to do with its flow through a metabolic pathway. The lack of robust high-throughput analytical  techniques to assess the flow of metabolic traffic through these pathways is a major limitation to improving our  understanding of cellular and organismal physiology.   Yale lacks a dedicated metabolomics core. The acquisition of the LC-DMS-QToF integrated system will  provide a core with: 1) a dedicated intermediary metabolomics platform on the KEGG metabolic map (CoMBI)  that through integrated omics can be reinforced by orthogonal transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics  or genomics data sets, 2) an expansion of Mass Isotopomeric MultiOrdinate Flux Analysis (MIMOSA) developed  by my laboratory to quantitatively measure intracellular fluxes through sequential position-specific label transfer  of stable isotopes, and 3) an in vivo inter-tissue metabolic flux analysis designed for genetic screens of  metabolism. The combination of DMS with the high resolution and speed of ToF and mass fragmentation  minimize isobaric interference which otherwise plague stable isotope studies. We have had the opportunity of  having the requested instrument consigned to our laboratory at Yale through an academic/industry technology  alliance with SCIEX as a way to generate preliminary proof-of-principle data and establish our pipelines. A  bioinformatic alliance with Elucidata has developed a customized, open-sourced, cloud-based platform with an  intuitive user interface to support our unique computational demands. The instrument operates in our existing  Islet, Oxygen consumption, Mass Isotopomer flux Core analytical core (IOMIC) through chargebacks and with  institutional support at cost under an established, university-approved Internal Service Provider (ISP) account.  This unique and transformative platform will integrate the tens of 1000s of mass spectroscopic features, correct  for natural abundance, and track positional movement of mass labels through cells to generate a high resolution  Ã¢Â€ÂœGoogle mapsÃ¢Â€Â of metabolism where the rate and direction of metabolic flow are quantified with demonstrated  application to microbiology, plants, fruit flies, cell culture, cancer and human tissue. These capabilities are  absolutely critical in order to sustain, and increase, the current pace of understanding metabolism in various  tissues.",,
C19444,The use of global connectivity estimates in real-time models of international infectious disease spread,"Human mobility plays an important part in the spread of infectious diseases. Mathematical models can assess the risk that an emerging outbreak will spread internationally, providing decision-makers with information to support early surveillance and control measures. In this project I will aim to improve how well these models capture international mobility patterns by exploring the suitability of different measures of connectivity. I will compare flight passenger data (which is commonly used in international infectious disease spread models) with alternative transport passenger statistics and novel data, such as location data from mobile phones. I will use these data sources (both individually and in combination) in models to make predictions of the risks of imported and exported disease cases, and assess how well these different models can retrospectively predict the global spread of COVID-19. I will use these findings to develop a statistical model and tools that are ready in advance of future outbreaks to make rapid assessments of the risks that they will spread geographically. The project will lead to more realistic models of international infectious disease spread and thus improve the information that is available to support decision-makers in controlling future outbreaks before they become widespread.",3,3a

P23189,"Creating high-resolution, epitope-focused vaccines","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT   The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to establish a novel method for  creating vaccines. These vaccines will lead to a highly focused antibody response toward  particular epitopes that are known to be the targets of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs). If successful, this approach could be applied broadly for the creation of important, new  vaccines that protect against infectious disease.   The ability to focus the antibody response toward particular epitopes would permit  vaccines to be created that elicit neutralizing antibodies, instead of non-neutralizing antibodies.  It would also permit creation of vaccines that lead to an antibody response directed against  highly conserved regions of an infectious agent, leading to broad spectrum protection against  different strains and minimizing the possibility of Ã¢Â€ÂœescapeÃ¢Â€Â by mutant variants.   The key starting material for the approach is a mAb that is broadly neutralizing against  the infectious agent. In recent decades, many potent, broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnAbs) have  been isolated and characterized in detail. Some of these bnAbs (for example, that target  influenza virus, Ebola virus and HIV-1) have entered clinical trials to test their efficacy in treating  infectious disease and/or to determine whether passively infused mAb can prevent infection.  Despite major research funding, however, it has generally not been possible to create vaccines  that are capable of eliciting antibodies with properties such as these bnAbs.   Here, a simple but radically different approach for creating epitope-focused vaccine  candidates is utilized that leverages a tool that has been available all along Ã¢Â€Â"" the mAb itself.  First, binding of the mAb is used to protect the target epitope. Next the surface of the remainder  of the antigen is modified to render it non-immunogenic. Finally, the protecting mAb is removed,  thereby deprotecting and exposing the unmodified, target epitope. The method is called protect,  modify, deprotect (or PMD). Ultimately, this high-risk, high-reward proposal could enable  creation of vaccines that elicit an antibody response against any given mAb epitope, and only  that epitope.",7,7i
C01060,COVID-19:  The ethical Exit Strategy: the path from relaxing measures to vaccination,"The focus around the Covid19 outbreak is at the moment mostly on the lockdown measures. However, the lockdown implies a societal, economic, and psychological cost that is not sustainable for too long. Shifting the focus onto the 'exit strategy' will be an urgent matter within a few months, if not weeks.  From the way talk about exit strategy is currently framed, it might appear that it will be a matter of technical decisions or, as the Government put it, a matter 'of taking the right steps at the right time, informed by the best science'. But this is only partly true. Policy makers will need to show commitment to ethical principles and be able to justify decisions to sacrifice certain values and principles for the sake of others, which will be unavoidable. The exit strategy cannot be designed and implemented unless certain ethical decisions about trade-offs between different values are made.  For example, decisions will need to be made about if and when to increase risk of illness or even death for certain individuals for the sake the psychological or financial interest of those who are being most heavily affected by the lockdown. Or to sacrifice to a certain degree privacy for the sake of public health in the use of contact-tracing technologies. Or again to use some level of coercion to enforce vaccination policies, when a vaccine becomes available. These decisions ar not merely about ""the best science"". These are ethical decisions.  It will not be possible to make these decisions without having a plausible story about which values will at some point have to be prioritized, and why.  This is not only because policy decisions need to be ethically acceptable (which is always a requirement, even in 'normal' times), but also because without appealing to certain ethical values, that go beyond merely technical considerations, it will be difficult to gain people's trust.  This research will result in a set of recommendations, in the form of policy papers addressed to the relevant Government departments as well as academic papers, about how to make these necessary trade-offs between values in a way that can inform both public health policy and public health communication strategy.   This project addresses, in chronological order, three core steps of the exit strategies that require close ethical scrutiny: 1) at what point, and through which steps, will it be acceptable to start the path back to some form of normality? 2) what kind of contact-tracing technologies (e.g mobile apps) can be used during the transition, and how?  3) when we have a vaccine, which vaccination policy should be adopted? There is also more general question about the level of coercion a Government may ethically enforce.  This is an ethics project intended to inform policy making. As such, the methodological approach will be the standard one adopted in applied ethics projects, which include strategy to ensure the outcomes have practical relevance and provide feasible and easily implementable advice. I will test ethical intuitions against ethical theories and vice versa, in search for maximal coherence (""reflective equilibrium""), so that the conclusions will be as much as possible in line with shared values; use thought experiments - i.e. fictitious examples - to test future scenarios against hypothetical ones, in order to ensure the advice provided is consistent with people intuitions across various scenarios; survey different ethical points of view to identify strengths and weaknesses of each, to ensure ethical advice is informed by a pluralistic perspective.",8,"8b, 8d"

P21695,Elucidating the immune response of Schreiber's bats to Lloviu virus infection in vitro and in vivo,"ABSTRACT  Bats play an important role as natural reservoirs of numerous RNA viruses with the potential to cause significant  harm to humans. In this proposal, we focus on Lloviu virus (LLOV), an under-investigated filovirus that circulates  in SchreiberÃ¢Â€Â™s bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Europe. Although the pathogenic potential of LLOV for humans  is not known, the close relationship of LLOV to the highly pathogenic Ebola and Marburg viruses raises concerns  that a potential spillover event could lead to an outbreak among humans.  LLOV was first detected SchreiberÃ¢Â€Â™s bats in Spain in 2002 and then again in Hungary in 2016. Sequence  comparison of the Spanish and the Hungarian LLOV RNA genomes suggests that RNA editing by cellular  deaminases, such as ADAR and APOBEC, might play a role in LLOV sequence diversification. In this application,  we propose to explore if host-mediated RNA editing drives LLOV sequence divergence and evolution in  SchreiberÃ¢Â€Â™s bats.  In Aim 1, we propose to sample SchreiberÃ¢Â€Â™s bats from geographically distinct colonies and obtain LLOV sequence  information from infected bats for comparative analysis. We will further develop tools based on highly sensitive  droplet RT-PCR and RNA FISH that allow to determine the expression pattern of ADARs and APOBECs in  LLOV-infected bat cell culture and in blood samples from infected animals.  In Aim 2, based on the determined ADAR and APOBEC expression patterns, we will knockout select ADAR  and/or APOBEC genes that might be involved in LLOV RNA editing in the bat cell line and examine the role of  these genes in LLOV sequence diversification and viral fitness in serial passaging experiments and cell culture  infection studies.  Upon completion of this work, we will have revealed whether host-specific RNA editors are the drivers of LLOV  evolution in bat cells. This work will contribute to our understanding of host-driven viral sequence divergence  and might help assess the risk of potential LLOV spillover events from bats to humans through host-driven  changes in viral sequences.",2,"2a, 2b"
C19845,The long and short of disruptions in surgical services due to the COVID-19 response: the impact and path forward,"Hard decisions were made about healthcare delivery in response to COVID, largely without evidence due to the unprecedented and rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic. Non-urgent surgeries were delayed to create space for the surge of COVID patients. The implications of these decisions are beginning to become clear and are widespread. Decision-makers want and need evidence to decide how to redesign surgical services to manage the backlog of surgical cases and to plan for additional waves of COVID-19 and subsequent pandemics.  We will generate evidence to support decisions about surgical services during COVID and other pandemics by answering 3 questions:   1) How do pandemics affect surgical care delivery? We will conduct an environmental scan of major surgical centres nationally to understand surgical service reallocated across Canada.  2) What is the impact of delaying non-urgent surgeries on surgery patients, healthcare providers and the healthcare system? We will extend our current work examining the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on surgical care using administrative/clinical databases to include the subsequent waves, and we will conduct interviews with patients whose scheduled surgery were delayed and their healthcare providers to understand the impact of delaying non-urgent surgeries. 3) How can we design surgical services in the future? Canadian decision-makers will use our findings to discuss and begin to establish guidance for surgical service provision during COVID and future pandemics, including managing a backlog of surgeries using a World Cafe.   We have strategically assembled a national team of researchers, clinicians, and decision-makers (knowledge users) to generate user-driven evidence to inform the provision of surgical care during COVID-19 and future public health emergencies.   Our findings will directly influence a redesign of surgical service delivery within our ""new normal"" healthcare system and for the future.",10,10a
P21738,Stimulating innate immunity to protect against Ebola virus infection,"Abstract. Filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg viruses are Category A pathogens (pathogens that provide  the highest risk to national security and public health) on NIAID's list of emerging infectious diseases due to  their ease of dissemination, high mortality rates, and potential use as bioterrorism weapons. There is a need  for fast acting, easy to use, and more effective medicines to protect against and improve survival from Ebola  virus infection. Vaccines in development require at least 10 days for subjects to develop immunity and thus are  not useful for treating newly infected patients or protecting non-vaccinated healthcare providers and first  responders in an emergency outbreak situation. Antibiotics and antibody cocktails under study require  intravenous infusion and resistance may develop through random or directed virus mutation. An alternative and  potentially synergistic approach for protecting against Ebola virus infection is to stimulate the innate arm of the  host immune system to resist viral infection. Macrophages and dendritic cells typically are the first cells  infected by Ebola virus. Upon entry, the virus replicates and expresses proteins that interfere with the host  cell's ability to block viral infection. The virus also causes host cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and  chemokines that attract other myeloid cells to propagate the infection and results in a dysfunctional immune  response unable to control the virus. Interferon gamma (IFNG) quickly (within hours) activates macrophages  and dendritic cells so that they resist infection by Ebola and other viruses, as well as infection by several  Category A facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Tularemia and Burkholderia. Thus, IFNG has  the potential to be an effective therapy against several deadly bioterrorism threats. However, IFNG has a very  short in vivo half-life, poor bioavailability, required intraperitoneal injection for efficacy in preclinical studies, and  has a narrow efficacy window, all of which limit the protein's utility as an Ebola therapy. We created a long-  acting human IFNG analog (PEG IFNG) that has superior bioavailability and a longer half-life following  subcutaneous injection and significantly greater efficacy than IFNG in animals. We hypothesize PEG-IFNG will  be significantly more effective than IFNG at preventing morbidity and mortality from Ebola virus infection both  as a protectant for pre-exposure prophylaxis and as a mitigator for post-exposure prophylaxis. We will test this  hypothesis by comparing efficacy of a murine PEG IFNG homolog and murine IFNG administered pre and post  infection for reducing morbidity and mortality from lethal Ebola virus infection in mice, as measured by survival,  weight gain and clinical sickness scores. These studies will lead to an effective treatment that confers  protection within hours and which can be administered easily (subcutaneous injection) to patients who recently  contracted Ebola virus, as well as to first responders and healthcare providers in an emergency outbreak  situation. Stimulating innate immunity using PEG IFNG will protect against Ebola virus and multiple other  intracellular Category A pathogens such as Tularemia and Burkholderia that replicate within macrophages.",6,"6a, 6g"
C10002,G2P-UK; A National Virology Consortium to address phenotypic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variation,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused 1.4 million deaths and has devastated economies worldwide. As SARS-CoV2 replicates and spreads, its RNA genome inevitably mutates. Mutations may confer altered properties of potential concern to human health, such as increased pathogenicity or transmissibility, or reduced sensitivity to prior immunity or antiviral drugs. Importantly, the imminent roll out of vaccination campaigns could provide strong selection pressure for escape from vaccine-induced immunity. We are a consortium (""G2P-UK"") of UK virologists who will work openly with COG-UK and UK-CiC, to establish an experimental pipeline and shared resources (reagents, methodologies and model systems) to rapidly define the phenotypic impacts of SARS-CoV-2 mutations as they emerge.

The choice of strains and mutations will be informed by a joint working group that includes COGUK members. Current virus strains will be immediately introduced into the pipeline, to accumulate a baseline of underpinning knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 behaviour, to validate the consortium working relationships and to seed mechanistic studies suitable for further research. Then, as variants of concern are detected, they will be prioritized for co-ordinated investigation in real time.

P22425,Next Generation Resolution of Antiviral Gene Networks,"SUMMARY  As the primary mediators of the innate response to viral infection, type I interferons (IFN-I) establish an antiviral  state in both infected and uninfected bystander cells through the induction of several hundreds of interferon  stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms by which the coordinated activities of these ISGs confer resistance  to diverse viruses, and the regulatory circuits that modulate their expression remain poorly understood. Working  with unique samples from individuals with hereditary syndromes of dysregulated IFN-I responsiveness, we have  identified a collection of thirty ISGs that confer resistance to diverse viruses (increased protection against RNA  and DNA viruses with both high and low pathogenic burden). We have also uncovered previously unappreciated  negative feedback mechanisms of IFN-I signaling. We have found that these regulatory circuits, as well as ISG  expression patterns, vary significantly across different cell types at steady state and upon IFN-I stimulation.  Recent technological advances now enable us to explore these cooperative ISG antiviral functions and negative  feedback mechanisms at unprecedented depth and resolution.  In the studies proposed here, we will identify subsets of ISGs sufficient to confer broad protection against multiple  viruses using a novel single cell RNA-Seq strategy. This approach provides the throughput required to conduct  complex combinatorial experiments while maintaining the high resolution to test specific hypotheses. Results  may offer new broad spectrum antiviral therapeutic strategies, which would be of particular value against  emerging viral pathogens. We will also investigate in detail the mechanisms by which IFN-I signaling establishes  a lasting imprint on cellular responsiveness to subsequent IFN-I stimulation. This recently described but  incompletely characterized phenomenon likely has important implications for successive infectious challenges  and viral susceptibilities. Combining a unique collection of clinical samples, cutting edge technologies, and  diverse and complementary expertise in immunovirology from our two laboratories, these studies are expected  to address long standing, fundamental questions in innate antiviral immunity, as well as to pioneer new directions  for developing antiviral therapies.",1,"1c, 1d"

Many hospitals around Canada developed visiting rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus and save masks, gowns, and gloves. Some visiting rules do not allow any family members to visit a patient in the hospital. When a patient is in the intensive care unit (ICU), they might be too sick to make decisions for themselves. This means that their family members might have to make important decisions for them. If a family member is not visiting the ICU, they may have to make these decisions over the phone. Making important decisions over the phone may be hard on the family member and the doctors or nurses.  Visiting rules are important to prevent the spread of coronavirus and save masks, gowns, and gloves. We aim to understand what effect these visiting rules have on families, doctors, and nurses. We want to know what support they need while these visiting rules exist. First, we will see which Canadian hospitals have visiting rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus. We want to know how many hospitals do not allow family to visit a patient in the hospital during the coronavirus outbreak. Next, we will talk with patients, families, doctors, and nurses about how hard it is to not have families visit a patient during their hospital stay. We also want to know if these new visiting rules caused any mental health symptoms in family members. Last, we will ask families, doctors, nurses, and hospital leaders what they think would have helped make these visiting rules easier. It is important that we understand how hard these visiting rules are on patients, families, doctors, and nurses. Our goal is to work with hospitals to improve how they support families, doctors, and nurses when visiting rules are in place.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
C02995,"Analysis of Antibody Neutralization Efficiency and Cellular Immunity in SARS-CoV-2-Positive Individuals Identified in At-Risk Individuals [Added supplements: COVID-19 Variant Supplement, COVID-19 Variant Network]","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its deadly course around the globe, research efforts are closely focused on viral immunity, antibody responses, and vaccine development. Increasing data from multiple reputable international medical sources now indicate that exposure to the COVID-19 virus induces an antibody response in nearly all exposed individuals. However, questions remain about the protective value of these antibodies against repeat exposure to the virus and how long this protection will last. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there are differences in the virus-neutralizing ability of antibodies produced by asymptomatic carriers of the virus and individuals that develop severe COVID-19 infection. Answers to these important questions will enable us to predict the likelihood of additional waves of COVID-19 as well as inform public health efforts and vaccine development.   For our study we will recruit a total of 1,000 healthy primary school teachers, daycare personnel, frontline medical workers in hospitals, and elderly people living in retirement homes. We will monitor them every two weeks for the virus and monthly for antibodies. We will regularly report back the data to the participants. The information learned from our laboratory will have five major outcomes: 1) It will enable early detection of infection and thereby greatly reduced the spread of the virus; 2) We will acquire a better sense of the numbers of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals exposed to COVID-19; 3) Antibodies in the blood of those infected will be tested to see how well it can neutralize the virus; 4) Critical information about immunity to COVID-19 and how long the immunity will last will be shared with the scientific community and local/regional/national health authorities; and 5) This new knowledge will help vaccine developers make the right decisions about how to create their vaccines and how to give them to all of us.","1, 3","1d, 3a"

P22457,Enhanced susceptibility to Zika virus during pregnancy: a role for maternal dengue antibodies,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is closely related to dengue virus (DENV). Since its discovery in 1947, ZIKV remained relatively unnoticed, causing small, local outbreaks primarily in parts of Africa and Asia, and was associated with minor symptoms, such as mild fever. However, in the last decade, ZIKV started to spread geographically across the Pacific islands, eventually reaching South America, where it caused an explosive outbreak that started in Brazil in 2015 and rapidly spread to other South and Central American countries. This has been accompanied by a startling link between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the development of birth defects among fetuses and babies, including microcephaly. It is unclear what factors may have led to the massive ZIKV outbreak or the severe disease manifestations in the Americas, but one potential variable is that much of the at-risk population in the Americas has preexisting immunity to DENV. It is well documented that preexisting immunity to one serotype of DENV can alter the disease pathogenesis of a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Because ZIKV outbreaks have occurred in regions around the world where DENV is endemic and due to the high degree of relatedness of ZIKV and DENV, it is critical to understand and characterize the extent to which prior infection with DENV exacerbates ZIKV disease. In this application, we will focus on how DENV antibodies impact ZIKV infection in the context of pregnancy by utilizing three model systems (immunocompromised Stat2-/- mice, immunocompetent humanized STAT2 knock-in mice, and human placental explants infected with ZIKV ex vivo).","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"
C15092,Implementing Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) Clinical Site:21-0011,"Project Summary  The primary goal of current COVID-19 vaccine trials is to measure vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinically  significant infection. However, on a population level, vaccine efficacy against all infection, including  asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic infection, is an important endpoint. This proposal outlines an ancillary  swab study to the Novavax Phase 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trial (PREVENT-19) to address these knowledge  gaps.  With the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we recognize a significant need for vaccines that not only modify  COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals but also reduce infection/transmission regardless of  symptomatology. In this study, participants will self-swab twice weekly starting at or shortly after their second  dose of either SARS-CoV-2 rS/M1 or placebo. These swabs will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.  Specific Aims of this study are to estimate the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 rS/M1 vaccine against infection, to  estimate the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 rS/M1 vaccine against asymptomatic/very mildly symptomatic infection, to  determine the sequence of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, to estimate the vaccine efficacy on duration  of infection, to estimate the vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 viral load as a proxy of transmission, and to  explore whether observed vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 illness reflects a transition from symptomatic into  asymptomatic infections versus an absolute reduction in all SARS-CoV-2 infections.  This ancillary swab study will tell us much about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 rS/M1 to reduce infection regardless  of symptomatology. In addition, it will provide important information on the ability of the vaccine to reduce duration  of infection and transmission.",7,7e

C18115,Vaccine Response On/off Methotrexate (VROOM): does temporarily suspending methotrexate treatment for two weeks enhance COVID-19 vaccine response?- A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Question: Does interrupting low-dose methotrexate treatment for two weeks after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster improve the immune response to it, and what are the underlying mechanisms? Background: Low-dose methotrexate has emerged as the first line systemic therapy for chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. However, its inhibitory effects on lymphocyte function causes suboptimal vaccine immunogenicity. A brief two-week treatment interruption after vaccination with the influenza vaccine protected 46% participants against all included strains compared to 22% participants with continued treatment. It is unknown if such a treatment interruption would improve immunity to vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2. This uncertainty resulted in conflicting advice from specialist societies, anxiety among patients, and may be addressed during the booster vaccinations in winter 2021. Aim: To examine the effects of a two-week interruption in low-dose methotrexate treatment (upto 25 mg/week) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster on vaccine immunogenicity in people with inflammatory conditions. Study design: Prospective, parallel group, randomised controlled trial with internal feasibility assessment, and nested mechanistic study. Setting: Secondary care Population: Adults (age 18 years or more) with stable inflammatory disease, on low-dose weekly methotrexate, able to interrupt treatment for two weeks according to their consultant. Randomisation: 1:1 individual randomisation. Minimised by inflammatory conditions, age (40 year or less, 41-64 year, 65 year or more), SARS-CoV-2 vaccine received in current vaccination cycle (mRNA vs. other). Intervention: Advice to withhold methotrexate for two weeks post SARS-Cov-2 vaccine booster. Comparator: To continue with methotrexate as usual. Outcomes: Primary: Anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody at week 4. Secondary: Anti-spike-RBD antibody at week 12; disease flare up, disease activity, treatment changes, quality of life at weeks 4 and 12. Mechanistic: Antibody neutralisation titres at weeks 4 and 12; effects of methotrexate adherence using validated bioassay on immunological outcomes. Research contact: 1] Pre-booster: consent, research assessments, blood collection. 2] Randomisation (phone): reconfirm eligibility, assess global disease activity. 3] Weeks 1, 2 (SMS): adherence to intervention, global disease activity (only week 2). 4] Weeks 4, 12: research assessment, blood collection. Analysis: Multi-level mixed effects models adjusted for randomisation factors and important prognostic factors using the as randomised population. Sample size: 560 participants (280 in each arm) will allow detection of an absolute difference of 25% anti-spike-RBD antibody, using 90%, 2-sided a=5% and 10% loss to follow up. 100 participants (50 in each arm) will participate in the mechanistic sub-study and provide additional blood samples for methotrexate adherence biomarker and neutralisation assay. Timeline: Set-up: months 1-3; Recruitment: months 4-16; Laboratory analysis: months 6 to 21; Data analysis: months 15-24. Write-up: months 21-24. Impact and dissemination: The findings will be disseminated to patients, the public, policy makers including the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation, and Rheumatology and Dermatology societies where they will influence clinical practice.","1, 4, 7","4a, 4e, 1d"
P23091,"Frontiers in Emerging, Reemerging and Zoonotic Diseases and Diversity (FrERZD2)","PROJECT SUMMARY  Our nation is nearly paralyzed by the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and painful inequities in health outcomes  among COVID-19 infected Americans of differing ethnicities. To help address these, we seek sponsorship to  train the next generation of pandemic and emerging disease researchers in the FRONTIERS IN EMERGING,  RE-EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES AND DIVERSITY. FrERZD2 will launch and sustain three vital  undertakings: sophisticated courses for skills development; relevant vital research experiences; and career  mentoring activities. Responsive to PAR-20-289, it is designed for 16 trainees who are graduate and medical  students, medical residents, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early-career faculty, and who also are US citizens or  permanent residents. The week-long course will help to ensure that clinically active scientists (especially  physicians) are able to obtain permission to participate. Too few laboratories are led by under-represented  minority (URM) scientists, and not enough new URM trainees graduate. We seek 5 years of sponsorship to  offer FrERZD2 courses at Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, in 2021, 2023, and 2025 and  Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU), a Hispanic-Serving Institution, in 2022 and 2024. Under the  overall directorship of Gerald Schatten from Pittsburgh, along with Jonathan Stiles at MSM, Idhaliz Flores from  PHSU, and Calvin Simerly, also from Pittsburgh, FrERZD2 is overseen by an external scientific advisory  committee. It offers dynamic advanced training courses consisting of daily lectures on emerging concepts,  followed by extended discussion, laboratory research, technologically intense workshops, and informal  seminars. Our similar training programs have recruited participants of whom 34% self-identify as African  American/Black and 30% as Hispanic Americans; 66% are women, and 62% are from URM institutions. Six  specific aims are proposed. Aim 1. Provide conceptual education and experimental training. Aim 2. Provide  background information and self-reflective exercises and demonstrations to understand, appreciate, and  address the historic and current underpinnings of inequities in the research workforceÃ¢Â€Â™s diversity and disparities  in health care. Aim 3. Sponsor meaningful mentored research. Aim 4. Discuss career planning. Aim 5.  Educate participants on the responsible conduct of research. Aim 6. Provide unbiased, quantitative,  independent mechanisms to track traineesÃ¢Â€Â™ careers, comprehensively and longitudinally. The programÃ¢Â€Â™s name,  FRONTIERS IN EMERGING, RE-EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES AND DIVERSITY, acknowledges  our hope that the COVID pandemic may soon recede significantly and our realization that other emerging,  reemerging, and zoonotic diseases will arise that must be timely addressed. Overall, in conducting this  program, we will continue to enhance and expand the research careers of the most promising scientists, with  sensitivity to ensuring full diversity in the NIAID workforce.",8,8f
C19827,"The COVID-19 Hospital Analytics Laboratory: Improving the Clinical, Organizational, and System Response to COVID-19","Hospital care has been dramatically reorganized to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, with an urgent need to preserve scarce resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment. Yet, there is minimal evidence about how to care for patients with COVID-19 in hospital and how to maintain high quality non-COVID care during the pandemic. Detailed clinical data, such as patient vital signs or medications, are needed to study COVID-19 and its individual- and system-wide effects. These data are available in hospital computer systems but have not been widely collected and shared for research. The General Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) has collected detailed clinical data from >340,000 admissions at 7 hospitals in Ontario, making it the largest inpatient repository about adult medicine in Canada and a valuable data source to study COVID-19. We propose to create the COVID-19 Hospital Analytics Laboratory by extending GEMINI to the 30 largest hospitals in Ontario, representing 70% of acute medical/ICU beds in the province. We will collect detailed clinical data from all medical and ICU admissions, including COVID-19 and other medical illnesses. Data will be linked to ICES longitudinal population datasets and updated every 1-3 months to create a globally unique platform that enables advanced analytics and machine learning and includes a diverse sample of patients, meaning research insights will be widely applicable. This platform will address all 5 CIHR objectives by supporting a breadth of research focused on improving hospital care in the setting of COVID-19. Data will be accessible to global experts in artificial intelligence, operations engineering, population modeling, public health and clinical epidemiology. Our first two research priorities will be to improve understanding and prediction of clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to study how the organization of hospital care in the setting of COVID-19 affects patient outcomes.","4, 11","4a, 4c, 11a"
P22122,Conserved molecular mechanisms of replication for mosquito-borne flaviviruses,"As obligate intracellular parasites, all viruses replicate by coopting host machinery through virus-host protein interactions. Arthropod-borne viruses, which are transmitted to vertebrates by arthropod vectors, must hijack host machinery in human and arthropod cells to accomplish the same fundamental aspects of virus replication. Thus, arthropod-borne viruses maintain protein interactions with host homologs (interologs) to replicate. Identifying these interologs is critical to understanding how an important group of viruses deals with this unique constraint from a biophysical perspective. For flaviviruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes-borne flaviviruses), it can also inform therapy development by expanding the list of drug targets since these viruses are a major source of human disease. Using a comparative proteomics approach, we recently found large-scale evidence of interologs for dengue virus (DENV), a major Aedes-borne flavivirus that infects nearly 400 million people annually. These interologs involve processes that are essential for virus replication in human and Aedes cells. We hypothesize that Aedes-borne flaviviruses use the conserved interologs to facilitate replication in human and Aedes cells due to the similar constraints place on these viruses and the complexity of maintaining virus-host protein interactions across multiple divergent hosts. The overall objective of this proposal is to systematically compare the role of interologs in virus replication for two Aedes-borne flaviviruses. We will focus on DENV to take advantage of our existing interolog data and yellow fever virus (YFV), a re-emerging Aedes-borne flavivirus that is distantly related to DENV. In Aim 1, we will systematically identify YFV-human and YFV-Aedes protein interactions using affinity purification and mass spectrometry. We will further identify YFV interologs through computational network integration. In Aim 2, we will identify interologs conserved between YFV and DENV using a similar computational network integration approach. We will then test the role of interologs in Aedes-borne flavivirus replication by measuring virus replication following interolog knockdown. This work will identify the conserved molecular mechanisms by which a medically important group of viruses replicates. It will reveal the biophysical parameters that constrain virus evolution. In the future, the interologs we identify could be leveraged as pharmacological or vector engineering targets to inhibit replication of multiple Aedes-borne flaviviruses. Our work would also lay the foundation to search for more interologs conserved across different arthropod vectors and/or different virus families.","1, 2, 4","1b, 2c, 4b"
C07095,The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use and psycho-somatic health in pregnant and postpartum women with intersecting vulnerabilities.,"SUMMARY/Abstract: The new clinical guidelines for diagnosing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) list self-regulation as oneof the key behavioral deficits in children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). There is a fundamentalgap in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms, spectrum, and severity of such deficits early in life and thebest analytical approaches to identify them. In addition, the effect of prenatal stress and postnatal environmenton PAE-induced alterations is poorly understood. The primary focus of the parent Ethanol, Neurodevelopment,Infant, and Child Health 2 (ENRICH-2) study is on identification of neurobehavioral deficits associated with PAEearly in life. This administrative supplement will allow us to examine the comorbid effect of COVID-19 pandemicand alcohol use on adverse maternal and infant outcomes in this cohort. The long-term goal of this supplementis to characterize the psycho-social effect of COVID-19 pandemic on adverse outcomes, including alcohol use,in a longitudinal birth cohort study, thus providing the foundation for future intervention studies. The objective ofthis supplement is to comprehensively evaluate the effect of COVID-19 related stress in pregnant andpostpartum women enrolled in the ENRICH-2 cohort. We will evaluate this by adding state-of-the-art self-reported measures integrated with real-time physiological data that are not currently part of the funded parentstudy. The rationale for this supplement is driven by the gap in knowledge about the effect of the COVID-19pandemic on psychosocial outcomes, alcohol use, and stress-related physical outcomes in pregnant andpostpartum women, a vulnerable population disproportionately affected. We will address this gap in knowledgeby pursuing two specific aims which evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on adverse maternal and infant outcomesin the ENRICH-2 cohort: 1) psychosocial outcomes and alcohol use, assessed as COVID-19 stress related toexposures and symptoms, COVID-19 pandemic adjustment, emotion regulation, mother-infant attachment, andalcohol consumption and 2) physiologic outcomes assessed as heart rate variability and sleep patterns,evaluated by wearable electronics - an approach particularly novel in the current social distancing environment.This approach is highly innovative, and will allow for the objective, real-time data collection in the climate ofprolonged social distancing and challenges associated with face-to-face research visits in vulnerablepopulations. A detailed characterization of COVID-19 related outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women,effect of COVID-related social isolation and other hardships on mental health and alcohol use, as well as thecumulative effect on pediatric neurodevelopmental outcomes are highly significant in order to lay out thefoundation for early effective interventions to mitigate the effects in these vulnerable populations.","4, 10","4a, 10a"
C07415,HICC: Humoral Immune Correlates for COVID19: Defining protective responses and critical readouts for Clinical Trials of Vaccines and Therapeutics,"A critical gap in knowledge is our understanding of immune correlates of protection from COVID-19, and the fine specificity of protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Thisgap is a huge impediment to an entire spectrum of major health care issues, ranging from return to work policies for NHS staff and recovered patients to guiding therapeutic interventions, vaccine development and clinical trials. The WHO cautions that simple antibody tests do not correlate with immunity. In fact robust responses correlate with disease severity, while lower titre responses are associated with accelerated viral clearance (Tan et al, medRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382). It isessential to have more specific, qualitative humoral assays and Immunoglobulin (Ig) teststhat clearly identify protective immunity, and distinguish from deleterious responses to be avoided by vaccination.We will characterise the; fine-specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antigen (i.e. S, RBD, N) specific Ig, cross-reactivity (i.e. of anti-S2) to other circulating human Coronaviruses (HCoV), correlation of Ig Fc-binding glycosylation patterns with Fc-gamma receptors used, with Immunoglobulin effector functions such as Neutralisation, Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) and Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The powerful combination of diagnostic, high throughput MS and comprehensive functional analysis will be applied to 3 clinical cohorts; 1) severe COVID-19 (progressors), 2) survivors(moderate) and 3) mild or asymptomatic cases.

C15367,Overcoming Vaccine Hesitancy in Rural Northern New England for Adolescents and Adults,"Vaccinating a significant portion of the American population with the COVID-19 vaccines is critical to achieve  herd immunity to end the pandemic. It was recently reported that 20% of rural residents will ""definitely not"" get  vaccinated. Hesitancy is higher among rural Americans for reasons including perceptions about COVID-19  risk, personal and/or religious reservations, distrust of science and government, and misinformation about  vaccinations. Across Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire, there is 25% less COVID-19 vaccination in our  predominantly rural communities compared with the limited, more densely populated cities and towns. There is  an immediate and compelling requirement to overcome vaccine hesitancy for two rural northern New England  target populations. Our adult population is 34% fully vaccinated (as of 4/16/21). The adolescent population (13  to 18 years old) is 10% vaccinated with the first dose; rapidly inoculating this younger cohort is necessary to  resume pre-pandemic in-school and structured extra-curricular life. We have a unique opportunity and  responsibility to address vaccine hesitancy for both cohorts by two complementary strategies that will leverage  the capabilities of the NNE-CTR. A community-engaged multidisciplinary approach, consistent with public  health objectives, practices, and policies, will immediately impact COVID-19 incidence and accelerate progress  toward mitigating the associated health, social and economic consequences. For the 13- to 18-year-old  group, we will pursue a parental-informed peer-based social media ""influencer"" intervention based in a  single rural Vermont county intended to increase recipient intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine  (Specific Aim 1). Our hypothesis is that electronic word-of-mouth communication utilizing information  dissemination through social media networks will promote peer persuasion to overcome vaccination  hesitancy. For the 25- to 65-year-old group, we will pursue a shared decision making intervention  (Specific Aim 2). Our hypothesis is that the shared and unique dimensions to communication between  patients and physicians impacts receptiveness to COVID-19 immunization and overcoming vaccine  hesitancy. To facilitate community engagement and maximize participation of rural northern New England  primary care practices, program leadership and NNE-CTR infrastructure of the will partner with experts at the  University of Vermont (UVM) and in the community.

C03620,Drivers of public responses toward Coronavirus outbreak and implications of social dynamics (COSD),"As humanity is facing for the first time in contemporary history, a pandemic with such impactful and unpredictable effects, understanding the drivers of public responses toward the Coronavirus outbreak is essential. Emerging research in the areas of the public's reactions toward similar epidemics (the Ebola crisis and the SARS epidemic) has been piecemeal.     This project aim to apply a more holistic approach to investigate public responses toward the pandemic and actions taken by authorities, individuals and businesses. We develop and test an integrative social psychological theory that combines specific emotional, cognitive, evaluative, and individual difference variables that undergird the public's reactions to social countermeasures taken to the outbreak of coronavirus.     The project is organized in two working packages. WP1 studies public responses toward the outbreak of coronavirus and social countermeasures broadly through a longitudinal survey in Norway, which will exam naturally occurring relationships amongst psychological reactions over time to ascertain the direction of causality. WP2 examines the socio-psychological mechanism underlying public responses toward countermeasures taken by authorities, individuals, and business. Field experiment with adult respondents will be conducted across 4 countries (Norway, Italy, China and USA), which will provide stronger conclusions of causality.    This project will contribute to knowledge advancement of the health and social psychology fields by providing an overarching framework to describe public responses toward present and future pandemics. The project output will also have a societal and policy impact by contributing to the management of the crisis both from short- and long-term standpoint. Policymakers can not only derive relevant feedback from predicting public reactions for their application of specific policies, but also anticipate and adjust to the fluctuations in public reactions to real societal changes.",9,9a
C07184,Vulnerability of SARS- CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses,"OVERALL Abstract: The overarching research theme for the Mount Sinai U54 Serological Center of Excellence ""Vulnerability ofSARS-CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses,"" is to fill the vital knowledgegap in factors contributing to the great vulnerability of lung cancer patients to morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection through serological analysis of antibody responses and studies of inter-individual variation inpatient-derived lung tumor and epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will characterize and compare lungcancer patients' antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with a matched non-lung cancer control group; quantitate differences in SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in lung cancer and normal lungepithelial cells from different lung cancer patients; and quantitate differences in neutralizing antibody responsesin lung cancer patients. This information is urgently needed to enact vaccine and other strategies for protectinglung cancer patients against development of COVID-19. While antibodies, induced by infection or vaccines, areprotective against many viruses, it has not yet been established if antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are protective, howmuch and what types of antibody are needed for protection, and how long protection will last are unknown.Likewise, we do not know if lung cancer patients can mount an effective immune response and if different aspectsof lung cancer or its treatment influences this immune response. Our overall hypothesis is that lung cancerpatients have a different (e. g. weaker) antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to persons withoutlung cancer, and that their lung cancer or lung epithelial cells play a role in viral replication of host responses,which together could explain the aggressive course and high fatality rate demonstrated in lung cancer patientswith COVID-19. Our U54 will determine whether natural infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (forecast fordeployment) will give comparable serological antibody responses longitudinally in 1,000 lung cancer patientsand a matched non-lung cancer control group (1,000 individuals); and determine if there are differences inantibody responses related to age, gender, tobacco history, and race/ethnicity. The U54 proposal has twoProjects and three Cores (Administrative, Clinical, and Data Sciences).

C14336,GCRF_NF359: Modelling the exposure risk tradeoff between public transit and private paratransit for transport decision making in the era of Covid19,"A safe and functioning transport system is vital to maintain economic activities in countries, developing or not. In most developing countries, the transport system is characterised by a crowded bus transit and micro-transit systems, supplemented by paratransits such as motorcycle taxis and autorickshaws. The paratransit sector is also a large source of employment (e.g. 3 Million motorcycle taxis in Nigeria, 300,000 in Kampala, Uganda, 104,000 in Dhaka, Bangladesh). The COVID19 pandemic has massively disrupted the transport sector and economic activities. In the project countries, motorcycle-based paratransits are banned from operating in order to maintain safe distances. In addition to disrupting travel and affecting the primarily poor users (prices in other modes have gone up), this has also resulted in massive unemployment and poverty among the drivers. However, there are also serious concerns about the safety of passengers in crowded buses or micro-transit vehicles, where maintaining appropriate distances are nearly impossible, and paratransits can be a viable alternative. The risks of virus exposure is also high in high occupancy vehicles due to the closed nature of the vehicles compared to the open nature of motorcycles and semi-open nature of autorickshaws. It may also be possible to mitigate risks in paratransits through barriers or shields. However, there are no studies investigating the relative risks of these modes, with or without the mitigation measures.      The project aims to model the exposure risk in different types of transport modes in order to allow policymakers to make an evidence-based optimum decision. The physics-based computer modelling will be accompanied by user surveys to understand their travel pattern, preferences and acceptance of various mitigation measures (such as shields designed using the models). Given the prevalence of micro-and paratransits in many other DAC countries, the results will be useful for other similar DAC countries too.","3, 5","3a, 5b"

For example: should someone be admitted to intensive care (IC) and for how long? What is the probability of death?    Research  In this research, prediction models are developed that provide an answer to these questions upon admission to the hospital. Data is used for this from more than 4000 patients from seven Dutch hospitals. The models use a limited number of factors that are easily measurable, such as respiratory rate, so that the model is easy and direct to use in all Dutch hospitals. Discussions will also follow with care providers, patients and family members about how the models best meet their wishes. The model is available as decision support in a web application: https://mdmerasmusmc.shinyapps.io/COPE/ .    Desired outcomes  The prediction models can then be used by healthcare providers to make decisions about the optimal care for the patient in consultation with patients and their families.

Development of effective antivirals is a major global priority especially early in the epidemic when vaccines are unavailable. This proposal aims at discovering and evaluating active compounds by rational design through 3D modeling of key viral proteins and also by analyzing cellular gene signatures induced by the virus. In-depth evaluation of selected compounds will include in vitro, ex vivo (human bronchial epithelium tissues) and in vivo (animal models) studies. These approaches, mostly based on drug repurposing (new indication for an existing drug), will result in rapid identification of anti-SARS CoV-2 compounds with accelerated clinical development.",6,"6a, 6l"
C00958,ABCD-USA Consortium: Coordinating Center,"AbstractAdolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and childhealth in the United States. ABCD consists of a Coordinating Center, a Data Analysis and InformaticsResource Center, and 21 research sites across the U.S. ABCD has enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10year-olds, and is tracking their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into youngadulthood. All participants receive repeated state-of-the-art neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing,bioassays, and detailed youth and parent assessments of substance use, mental health, physical health, andculture and environment.In March 2020, when our participants are ages 11-13, the world became substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an upheaval in the economy and the lives of almost every family. The majority of U.S.schools closed to reduce viral spread. Many parents incurred changes in work (from home, longer shifts,reduced wages, and/or job loss), some services and support systems became disrupted, and case counts anddeath tolls surge. The massive multifaceted impact of this unprecedented event has the potential to affect fordecades those who are currently children. The proposed research immediately leverages the ABCD cohort,infrastructure, and existing protocol to rapidly characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on eachchild in the study. By collecting this situational information as soon as possible, we can use existing ABCD datato examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, cognition, substance use,academic achievement, social functioning, and physical and mental health.The proposed project would query all ABCD participants and their parents multiple times about the impact ofthe pandemic on their lives and, in a subset of participants, examine their physical activity and sleep objectivelywith activity trackers (Fitbits), over the months of school closures, job loss, and disease spread. This will allowthe consortium and scientific community at large to test multiple aims regarding how various facets of thepandemic affect development. This includes: (1) characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on brainand cognitive development and onset of substance use; (2) evaluating the extent to which alternative schoolingapproaches exacerbate or mitigate the impact of the pandemic on brain and cognitive development andsubstance use outcomes; and (3) evaluating the extent to which family stressors exacerbate or mitigate theimpact of the pandemic on neurobiological, cognitive, and substance use outcomes. This unprecedented crisisprovides an opportunity to make use of ABCD's elaborate infrastructure and rigorous scientific processes todiscern critical dimensions of development not previously envisioned.",10,"10a, 10d"
P23499,Long-term alterations of host-microbiome interactions and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases progression after pneumonia,"Challenges. The incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) increases after infections, but causal mechanisms are not understood yet. Pneumonia, which can be acquired in the community (such as flu and COVID-19) or during hospitalization, is a leading cause of infectious diseases. The main idea of the Homi-lung project is to investigate the causal relationship between CVD progression and the immune and microbiome alterations observed after pneumonia.   Objectives. During the Homi-lung project, we aim to i) define the medical and societal, and patient needs; ii) increase medical doctor'Äôs knowledge of the physiological processes linking pneumonia and CVD; iii) enable early identification of patients at risk of CVD progression; and iv) preclinically develop new treatments.  Implementation. The Homi-lung project will address this challenge by comparing CVD rates between patients cured of pneumonia and matched patients who had not developed pneumonia during a prospective 3-year follow-up. We will analyze longitudinal samples collected in these populations and develop new algorithms by artificial intelligence to associate host-microbiome interactions with CVD progression. We will also demonstrate the causal link between CVD progression and host-microbiome interactions in preclinical pneumonia models.   The interdisciplinary and ambitious Homi-lung project brings together 8 partners from 5 EU countries, with expertise in pneumonia, CVD, immunology, microbiome, and artificial intelligence and is uniquely placed to reach these objectives.  Impacts. The project will provide clinicians with robust evidence contributing to identifying patients at risk of CVD after pneumonia. By developing new biomarkers and preclinical validating treatments to TRL4, the project will contribute to improving patients'Äô recovery and reducing the burden of infections. This project, particularly timely after the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, will also increase European preparedness for the next pandemic.",4,4d

This  should directly support the U.S. CDC mission of strengthening public health surveillance systems  globally to prevent the spread of emerging diseases. This project will rely upon the Kinshasa School of  Public HealthÃ¢Â€Â™s considerable experience with training public health practitioners, conducting scientific  research trials, and supporting the DRC Ministry of Health to accomplish its objectives. The project will  be framed around a laboratory-based surveillance system for MPX in DRC to collect accurate case burden  data. We will expand upon this framework by evaluating new training methods for health workers,  improving geographic data, and assessing new diagnostic platforms when available. We will use our  relationships with health systems in highly affected areas to conduct clinical trials of care regimens,  vaccines, and anti-viral therapies. We will perform serosurveys in high-risk and survivor populations to  better understand transmission risk factors, viral persistence, and sequalae. We will work with key groups  in these areas to identify wildlife reservoirs of MPX and collect qualitative data on the attitudes and  behaviors of key populations living in these communities. We will work with the government of DRC to  improve the ability to respond to outbreaks quickly by preemptively training response workers,  developing health promotion networks, and responding to misinformation rapidly. We will share results  with national stakeholders and other nations interested in being better prepared for responding to endemic  and imported MPX cases.","3, 6, 7, 12","3d, 6h, 7g, 12a"
P22068,Functional Role of Pseudouridine on Zika Virus Gene Expression,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, that during the 2015-2016 outbreak in the Americas was associated with severe and devastating developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly, in babies born from infected women. The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of ZIKV directs translation of viral proteins, functions as a template for replication of the genome and is packaged into new virus particles. These functions are in part regulated by specific RNA structures within the untranslated regions of the RNA, and via interactions with viral and cellular proteins. More recently RNA modifications have been shown to significantly affect the virus infectious cycle. Although more than 170 different RNA modifications are known to decorate natural RNAs, only N6-methyladenosine has been reported to affect ZIKV gene expression. The role of other RNA modifications on ZIKV RNA is presently unknown. Using biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides to affinity isolate virus RNA from cells and virions, and mass spectrometry to identify RNA modifications, we discovered that more than 30 different RNA modifications are present on ZIKV RNA. In this application we focus on pseudouridine (Y), an abundant but understudied RNA modification. The incorporation of Y on cellular RNAs affects the folding, stability, and translation of RNA, and RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. We propose that Y on the ZIKV RNA genome promotes virus translation and replication. In this application we propose using a next generation sequencing approach combined with chemical modification of pseudouridine to identify specific Y sites on ZIKV genome (Aim 1). Next, we will undertake RNAi depletion and overexpression of cellular pseudouridine synthase proteins to identify the host enzymes responsible for installing pseudouridine on ZIKV RNA (Aim 2). Last, we will use mutagenesis and modulation of the pseudouridine synthase enzymes to elucidate if pseudouridine regulates ZIKV translation and/or replication (Aim 3). Moreover, these studies will be undertaken in the context of virus infection in mammalian and mosquito cells, two hosts biologically relevant to the virus life cycle, which could inform the role of RNA modifications in virus transmission and host adaptation. We expect that this research will advance our knowledge of RNA modifications which have been shown to be novel and important regulators of viral gene expression and improve our understanding of the molecular biology of ZIKV. This research will therefore provide critical information on a virus with significant impacts on human health and that currently lacks therapeutic options.",1,"1b, 1c"

C07181,High Accuracy Nanopore Sequencing,"This project is an expansion of the scope of our current funding which was awarded to improve nanoporesequencing. In the course of our research to improve nanopore DNA sequencing, we have discovered anddeveloped a new high-resolution single-molecule tool to observe the motion of helicases and polymerases. Thetool, which we called Single-molecule Picometer Resolution Nanopore Tweezers (SPRNT), is able to reveal thesingle-nucleotide steps of helicases and polymerases at unprecedented detail. These enzyme steps are so small(~0.3 nm) and fast (~ 1 ms) that no other existing single-molecule technique can resolve such motion in real timeand at physiological conditions. The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus encodes for an RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, also known as non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), and a superfamily 1B helicase, known as nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13). Both of these enzymes are essential and specific to the in vivo replication of manyviruses, making this genomic replication machinery an ideal drug target. Several drug candidates to inhibit theseenzymes exist, however, none are as effective as they need to be to stem the tide of the current pandemic. Manyquestions remain about how exactly these drugs interfere with the function of nsp12 or nsp13. SPRNT providesan opportunity to answer these questions. We aim to use SPRNT to analyze the single-molecule motion of nsp12and nsp13 in physiological conditions and in the presence of drugs against them. The exact knowledge of themechanisms by which various drugs inhibit nsp12 or nsp13 will enable more rational and rapid design of effectiveantiviral drugs that have the potential to stop COVID-19.",1,"1b, 1c"

P22909,DYNAMICS AND EVOLUTION OF IMMUNE RESPONSES TO INFLUENZA VIRUSES,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our goal is to develop a quantitative framework for the generation, boosting and maintenance of  immunological memory. Mathematical models are useful because immunization and infection involve the  interaction of rapidly changing populations of virus and multiple populations of immune cells. We first  develop and validate models using experiments in mice. We then use these validated models to analyze  data from human vaccination studies.  Aim 1 asks how prior immunity affects and potentially limit the boosting of immunity and apply this to  influenza. Our approach is to develop models to understand why prior immunity limits boosting of  antibodies to conserved regions of the virus. Specifically, we use our models to better understand how  prior immunity might limit boosting of antibody responses to conserved regions on the stem of the  hemagglutinin molecule that is the focus of universal influenza vaccines.  Aim 2 considers the factors that affect the durability of humoral immune memory, and address questions  such as why memory generated by immunization with protein antigens is less durable than immunity  generated by virus infection, and how prior immunity can differentially affect the boosting and generation  of memory to new strains of influenza.  Aim 3 considers the generation of CD8 T cell memory to influenza and yellow fever. We will determine  how repeated exposure to influenza affects the diversity of the CD8 T cell responses generated. We have  access to a unique dataset that follows the number of YFV-specific CD8 T cells, changes in their  phenotype, and their turnover from heavy water labelling studies for a period of over one year. Our analysis  of this dataset will allow us to address an ongoing controversy regarding whether are long-term memory  CD8 memory stem cells are generated rapidly after immunization or only gradually over time.  Aim 4 describes computational tools that we will build for B cell receptor sequence analysis and  visualization, and for simulation of the dynamics of immune responses. These tools will be widely  accessible online, and promoted at workshops and scientific symposia we organize.",1,"1d, 1e"
P22435,Flavivirus cellular tropisms driving dissemination and transmission in mosquito vectors,"Project Summary/Abstract  The research objectives of this fellowship are to determine the cellular tropisms of three mosquito-borne  flaviviruses of public health importance Ã¢Â€Â"" Zika virus, dengue virus and yellow fever virus Ã¢Â€Â"" within their Aedes  aegypti vectors and to define the roles of specific cell populations in viral dissemination and transmission. The  aims are to 1) identify the specific cell populations critical for viral dissemination from the midgut to the salivary  glands, and 2) define the impact of specific tissue tropisms on mosquito feeding behavior and viral transmission.  Aim 1 will be accomplished by generating microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles for midgut, hemocyte and  neuronal cell populations and selecting miRNAs that are highly differentially expressed in each population. We  will confirm infection of cells expressing these miRNAs and generate cell-specific, miRNA-restricted viruses  containing target sequences for cell-specific miRNAs to probe the roles of each cell type in viral dissemination.  Aim 2 will be accomplished by using miRNA-restricted viruses to determine the effect of neuronal cell and salivary  gland infection on mosquito feeding behaviors and subsequent transmission of the virus by observing infected  mosquitoes feeding on mice and testing mice for the presence of virus. The data and tools produced by this work  could aid the development of transmission control strategies that target viral replication in specific cell  populations within the vector. Research and postdoctoral training activities will be undertaken at both Colorado  State University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, CO. The sponsor and co-  sponsor laboratories have complimentary research interests and facilities that will promote the success of this  project.

C17935,"Immune responses to SARS-CoV2 cause activation of platelets, resulting in thrombosis, which can be ameliorated by re-purposed drugs","Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with thrombosis in the lung, heart, kidneys and other organs, and is likely to contribute substantially to the high levels of mortality and morbidity in these patients.  Whether abnormal platelet function accompanies disease progression is unknown.  We will use deep-phenotyping approaches combined with established multi-parameter analysis to determine whether platelet function is altered in patients upon hospital admission, if this changes through disease progression, and whether levels of change correlate with disease severity.  This will be incorporated an interventional study (MATIS) designed to test the benefits of repurposing drugs that target signalling proteins expected to diminish the inflammatory response to virus, which is proposed to lie behind severe disease pathology.  These targets, the kinases Syk and Jak, also regulate platelet function.  We will therefore also assess the impact of drug administration on platelet function, in comparison with standard of care, and establish whether potential benefits are associated with diminished platelet function.  Preliminary data indicate that abnormally glycosylated antibodies produced early in COVID-19 infection enhance platelet function through stimulation of the platelet IgG receptor.  We will therefore also determine whether immune-driven activation of platelets (thrombo-inflammation) is inhibited by the licenced Syk and Jak inhibitors.The outcomes from this study will establish whether abnormal platelet function lies behind life-threatening COVID pathology, and whether use of drugs that target both the platelet and immune responses to the virus offer promising therapeutic options.

C07314,Domestic Abuse: Harnessing Learning Internationally under Covid-19 (DAHLIA-19),"There is considerable evidence that, both in the UK and globally, the risks of living with domestic violence and abuse (DVA) have increased consequent to Covid-19 restrictions. A range of responses at policy and practice levels have emerged. These differ across states and their take-up and impact are unknown. Capturing diverse responses and early evidence of impact can influence approaches to further lockdowns and contribute to planning for lifting restrictions and recovery. This study harnesses the global nature of policy and practice responses to DVA under Covid-19 by examining policy and practice responses in the UK; Australia; Ireland and South Africa. These have been selected as upper or upper/middle income countries with established DVA services. The Connect Centre for International Research on Interpersonal Violence and Harm will utilise its established partnerships to convene online stakeholder meetings with policy shapers and service providers in all four countries. These will generate key questions and contacts to inform a mapping and rapid review study that will collect innovative policy and practice examples together with documentary and other evidence across all four countries. Critical appraisal by an international panel of a selected sample of initiatives will enable in-depth study. The research will consider whether responses address all family members: victims, perpetrators and children.

P21755,Elucidating the Mechanism of Ebola Virus Enterotoxigenicity,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is highly lethal with >20,000 cases reported during the 2014-16 West Africa epidemic  and >2,800 cases reported during the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ebola virus  (EBOV) belongs to the Filoviridae family and encodes for 7 proteins including a single glycoprotein (EBOV-GP)  that has been shown to play a crucial role in EVD pathogenesis. During EVD, gastrointestinal fluid loss via large  volume watery diarrhea leads to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and increased mortality.  Furthermore, feces are categorized as highly infectious, thus excessive fluid loss incites environmental  contamination increasing the risk of nosocomial viral transmission. The physiological mechanisms of viral  glycoproteins acting as enterotoxins and prompting high volume diarrhea have been well described.  However, the molecular trigger and mechanisms describing how EBOV stimulates high volume watery diarrhea  during EVD have never been studied. Our preliminary data in human intestinal cells suggests an enterotoxin-  like behavior for EBOV-GP as it induces a rapid and dose-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+  concentration that is mitigated by inhibition of Phospholipase C (PLC). Moreover, EBOV-GP stimulation  induces activation of chloride channels. The working hypothesis is that EBOV-GP induces intracellular Ca2+  increase in the gastroinstestinal epithelia, triggering an apical surface ion transport dysregulation resulting in  increased permeability and water secretion. The project goals are to determine if EBOV-GP acts as an  enterotoxin, study if it triggers a malabsorptive or secretory process and fully elucidate the mechanisms leading  to high-volume watery diarrhea during EVD. For this, the project has three specific aims conceptualized for using  of small intestine and colon cells since they diverge in absorption and secretion processes. Aim 1 will study the  contributions of Ca2+ sources in the increased levels of intracellular Ca2+ triggered by EBOV-GP and elucidate  its upstream signaling pathway. Aim 2 will assess the dynamics of Na+ and Cl- across the cell membrane, cell  permeability and fluid transport after EBOV-GP stimulation. Polarized cell cultures will be used to mimic the  ions/fluid movement and directionality. Aim 3 will feature whole-cell patch clamp to identify the ion channels  being altered by EBOV-GP. This project will be achieved using contemporary in-vitro assays and combine  microscopy, molecular biology, electrophysiology and biophysics. The completion of this project will provide the  awardee training in electrophysiology techniques advancing his career and complementing his immunology and  cell biology background. The proposed project will provide the awardee the skill set to study host-pathogen  interactions in the context of the interplay between electrophysiology, immunology and cell biology. This project  has translational impact as it could lead to novel therapeutic targets and strategies for EVD high volume diarrhea,  directly improving the patients prognosis and reducing viral transmission in healthcare settings in the field.",1,1b
C03777,Repurposing of Universal and Immunogenic MultiTEP Platform Designed for AD to Develop SARS-CoV-2 Multiepitope Vaccine,"Project SummaryTwo months after the first report of a U.S. death from COVID-19, the death rate is 228 per million people, thetenth highest rate globally. The mortality rate from COVID-19 in those aged 45-54 years is ~5%, and it increasedto 13% in people of 50-60 years old, and sadly 80% of all U.S. coronavirus deaths occurred among people 65years of age and older. To protect people from COVID-19, multiple groups in all over the world have begundeveloping vaccines based on the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2. We do not know whether both cellular andhumoral immune responses are necessary for protection against the SARS-CoV-2, but recent data withconvalescent plasma administration into the COVID-19 patients indicate that vaccine inducing neutralizingantibodies could be sufficient for the protection against this infection. More of that, it is possible that a vaccinethat contains currently unknown T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 may induce in immunized subjects a cytokinestorm upon subsequent viral infection that could lead to severe adverse events, culminating in death inparticularly susceptible elderly individuals.     To avoid autoreactive T cell activation, using the current AG060965program and other NIA grants, we have developed a universal and extremely immunogenic MultiTEP vaccineplatform for A.D. vaccines targeting pathological Aβ, tau, and α-Syn. Taking advantage of this development wepropose in this Administrative Supplement to create a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on proprietary MultiTEPplatform technology. We hypothesize that MultiTEP platform-based vaccine could induce protective neutralizingantibodies in immunocompromised elderly people, including MCI/AD patients. This vaccine may differ from manyothers because it could stimulate adaptive immunity, providing broad coverage of human MHC polymorphismsand activating both naive Th cells and pre-existing memory Th cells generated in response to conventionalvaccines and/or infections with various pathogens during one's lifespan without the activation of harmful virus-specific T cells. Therefore, using our nucleic acid-based vaccine technology we will rapidly generate DNAconstructs by attaching twenty B cell epitope genes from the spike protein to MultiTEP, (ii) select several B cellepitopes that induced virus-neutralizing antibodies in mice, (iii) generate prototype recombinant vaccine, CoV2-2019 targeting simultaneously up to three B cell epitopes associated with production of neutralizing antibodies.This multiepitope CoV2-2019 vaccine will be tested in aged non-human primates (model of age-associatedimmunosenescence) ana transgenic mouse model of A.D./tauopathy (seasonal model of vaccination of elderlypeople and MCI/AD patients previously vaccinated with tau-vaccine, AV-1980).",7,"7a, 7i"
P22038,A novel approach of age-grading of mosquitoes using SERS and machine learning models,"Project Summary  Mosquito-borne pathogens, including malaria, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya continue to be a major public  health concern globally. As only older mosquitoes are infectious and represent a risk to human health, scientists  have sought to age-grade mosquitoes based on this understanding; however, no reliable, cost effective and  practical methods exist to age mosquitoes despite the tremendous epidemiological value of this approach. The  overall objective of this R01 is to establish a novel approach to age-grade mosquitoes Aedes aegypti in the field.  The approach we took is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to analyze the biomolecules  from mosquito water extract that are bound with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and then the SERS spectra are  used in modern machine learning models to age-grade the mosquitoes. Our central hypothesis is that AgNPs  interact with specific biomolecules enabling SERS to generate unique and predictable spectral information for  establishing modern machine learning models to determine the age of mosquitoes. Our prior work demonstrates  the feasibility of SERS and Artificial Neuron Networks (ANNs) to determine the age of both lab (error <1 day)  and field-collected (error < 2 days) mosquitoes Ae. aegypti. In the proposed work, we will establish robust lab  and field-deployable protocols to produce reliable and repeatable SERS data of mosquito water extract. Then,  we will manipulate the lab and field conditions to determine the impact of biotic (food and infection status) and  abiotic (temperature) to SERS characteristics. Robust and accurate machine learning model based on modern  ANNs and Domain Adoption (DA) strategies will be established and validated for age-grading mosquitoes in the  field. In addition, we will explore the Multi-task Learning (MTL) strategies to simultaneously determine the age  and infection status. Our long-term goal is to establish a rapid, cost-effective, and field-deployable system that  enables real-time analysis and data sharing to facilitate epidemiological studies, risk assessment, vector control  intervention monitoring and evaluation.",2,2b
P21426,Usutu virus risk to the UK: Determining local vector competence and modelling climate suitability,"Usutu virus infects and causes large scale mortality in certain species of wild bird (such as blackbird and crows); but in recent years it has been recognised as zoonotic, infecting people, and causing fever and, in some cases, neuro-invasive disease such as encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.    Usutu virus is spread by mosquitoes and is emerging throughout Europe. During the warm summer of 2020, zoonotic mosquito-borne Usutu virus was detected in two species of wild birds in Greater London. Furthermore, Usutu virus was detected over a long time period and in the non-migrating house sparrow, strongly suggesting that the virus has established in the UK and local British mosquitoes are transmitting it.    The primary mosquito vector of Usutu virus in Europe, the Northern House mosquito, is present in the UK where it feeds predominantly on birds. Recent studies have shown that a laboratory colony of this species is competent to transmit the virus at warm temperatures. Therefore, our native mosquitoes may therefore be capable of transmitting it. In addition, other species of mosquito present in the UK feed on both birds and humans and may therefore be capable of spreading the virus from the bird reservoir to humans. The ability of these species to transmit Usutu virus in the wild is not known.    The overall aim of this proposal is to assess the risk to the UK of local and invasive mosquitoes transmitting Usutu virus to birds and humans, at realistic UK temperatures. Using these results, we will then mathematically model the suitability of the UK climate, in conjunction with data on the geographical range of local mosquitoes and reservoir bird species. This will yield risk maps, showing where and when Usutu virus is capable of being transmitted in the UK.    At the end of this project, we will have collected extensive data on Usutu virus and the ability of our mosquitoes to transmit it. This will put the UK in a stronger position to effectively manage an outbreak, should one occur in the next few years. Some of the data will also inform on other mosquito-borne viral threats. As demonstrated by bluetongue in northern Europe, West Nile across the world, and Zika in South America, arboviral threats can appear suddenly and spread quickly. Basic research in advance is needed if such outbreaks are to be effectively contained with minimal impact on human and animal populations.",2,2b

My lab has a long-standing interest in understanding how cellular DUBs are regulated by environmentally-produced small molecules, including ROS, toxic heavy metals, chemical pollutants and carcinogens. Similar to human DUBs, viral DUBs, such as the coronavirus Plpro, are proteases that cleave ubiquitinor ubiquitin-like proteins from pro-proteins or from conjugates on target proteins. In doing so, viral DUBs hijack the balance of ubiquitination dynamics in infected cells, potentially disrupting numerous cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation, gene expression, kinase activation, DNA repair and ultimately favoring microbial pathogenesis. How viral DUBs are particularly susceptible to environmental exposures, such as ROS and chemical pollutants, have not been adequately explored, especially as novel modulators of human pathogenesis.     As it pertains to the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the U.S. population and worldwide, we will be focusing our research goals on understanding   1) how the SARS-CoV-2 Plpro protease activity (cleavage of pro-proteins, ubiquitin-, and ISG15-conjugated proteins) can be regulated by environmentally-generated small molecules, and   2) identifying COVID-19 disease-relevant cellular targets of thePlpro upon viral infection in human lung epithelial cells.",1,1b

C14330,GCRF_NF407 - Emergency strategies for mitigating the effects of COVID-19 in care homes in low and middle income countries,"In many developing countries there are large numbers of care homes for older people. Until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, they received little attention from policymakers or academics. There is now understandable concern that the pandemic will affect care home residents, as well as staff. Responsibility for care homes is mainly devolved to local governments, and many are looking to develop emergency plans. These need to take account of specific contexts, including scarce resources and very limited regulation of care homes prior to the pandemic. We will partner local government agencies in three countries (Brazil, South Africa and Mexico) to support the development and implementation of emergency plans, and to assess their effects on care homes. Based on consultations with a wider network of policy-makers and experts, we have developed a set of guiding principles (The CIAT Framework). We will work with local governments to put this framework into practice, refine it and assess its potential value for developing countries more generally. At the same time, we will develop an interactive online network with policy-makers and researchers interested in care homes and COVID-19, linked to an existing online policy network we have developed during the pandemic.",9,"9a, 9e"

Our overriding ambition is to overcome this deficit through field studies and implementation research in specific populations early enough to already serve in the response to the current outbreak. Four technical work packages (WP) address the four main objectives:   To provide real-time clinical data to improve risk assessment and response, deploying an established mHealth Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) in Nepal, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria;  countries likely to be affected more intensively than the EU.(WP I)   To implement differential serolomics (multiplex serology) for population serum samples from Germany and Nepal  for investigating pre-existing cross or partial immunity against COVID-19  and impact on susceptibility.(WP II)  To apply comprehensive modeling, sampling and artificial intelligence on data from the first two work packages in order to assess predictors for severe outcome, transmission dynamics and intervention effectiveness.(WP III)  To measure and improve quality of epidemic containment measures through implementation research in countries particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 epidemic, in order to tailor effective and efficient control measures to health systems realities in Nepal and Ivory Coast, and to reduce the intensity of importation into the EU. (WP IV)  We combine a) an accelerated ad-hoc outbreak response to address the urgency and b) a sustainable strategy to serve beyond the current public health threat from COVID-19. Software maturity, established networks, pre-approval investments and interdisciplinary expertise among partners - including first hand from China - shall generate first findings within weeks, such as validated criteria for high-risk groups, effectiveness of contact tracing, set-up serolomics platform.","3, 4, 9","3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4c, 9a"
P21733,EpiCenter for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence,"Project Summary/Abstract:  The Epicenter for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence brings together a consortium of leading research  institutions to advance an understanding of viral emergence from wildlife into humans living in forest and rapidly  urbanizing ecosystems. Our work will enhance preparedness for disease emergence events in the Congo Basin  and Amazon Basin forest regions and facilitate response efforts at the source of emergence. Our multidisciplinary  team has internationally recognized expertise in infectious disease epidemiology, virology, human health, animal  health, medical entomology, microbiology, and disease modeling. Our proposed activities integrate human,  animal, and vector surveillance to enable insight into cross-species disease transmission and facilitate  responsiveness to evolving needs that impact country, regional, and global emerging infectious disease risk. In  our initial work, we propose to investigate the epidemiology of arboviruses and filoviruses, which include  emerging viruses currently threatening global health security. We will evaluate disease transmission dynamics  at the primary stage of emergence in humans, in forest communities where people are highly susceptible to virus  spillover from wildlife and mosquitos. We will also investigate these viruses in the second stage of emergence,  in urban centers peripherally connected to forests, where viruses have adapted to human-to-human transmission  (by direct or vector-borne transmission). Targeted filoviruses and arboviruses at proposed sites in Uganda and  Peru represent a range of emergence histories, from recent emergence events, to seasonal and annual re-  emergence events, to introduction events where viruses have adapted to entirely new ecosystems, vectors, and  vertebrate hosts. Research at these sites will advance our understanding of cross-species transmission for  viruses across this spectrum of emergence. Our work will optimize best practices in acute febrile illness  surveillance in high-risk communities coupled with wildlife and entomologic risk characterization studies to  facilitate deployment of next generation techniques in early detection of virus emergence and monitoring of  sustained transmission in at-risk communities. Our consortium has a demonstrated commitment to strengthening  international capabilities for emerging infectious disease research in resource-limited countries. We are well-  poised to contribute to important advances in capacity in the Amazon and Congo Basin forest region with  partners in Uganda and Peru for completion of our proposed project and long-term sustainability for the greater  region and across the Emerging Infectious Disease Research Center network.","1, 2, 3","1b, 2a, 3a"
C07390,Understanding and mitigating the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NHS staff in England,"The nation has relied heavily on NHS healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19  pandemic and an effective workforce requires good mental health. Poor quality surveys  report high levels of distress in HCWs unconfirmed by some population based studies. So  robust evidence is still lacking on the size and impact of the pandemic on HCWs, who is at  risk, and what support they may require, if any.  We will investigate the psychosocial and occupational outcomes of the pandemic on NHS  staff in England, using a well-defined sampling frame across 13 Trusts.  Our pilot study, already conducted in three Trusts (Guy's and St Thomas', King's College  Hospital, and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trusts) has demonstrated  feasibility and acceptability of a brief baseline questionnaire. We request funding to  expand the study in time, geography, and depth. The original sample will be followed four  and eight months later, with ten new centres contributing data at these timepoints.  Questionnaire data will be validated through standardised diagnostic interviews  administered by telephone in a sub-sample, to distinguish distress from disorder.    Additionally, we will address the use and outcomes of staff support/wellbeing, and a UKRI-  funded ethnicity-focused module will capture inequalities in mental health and    occupational outcomes.  PPI/E will be central: we will establish a steering PPI/E group of NHS workers, unions, and  employers, ensuring strong representation of BAME staff.  Findings will inform an effective support strategy for NHS staff during and following the  pandemic, for example through workforce planning, emergency response strategies, or  targeted support.

Building on a pre-existing set of bioactive small molecules, which are at least at the validated hit level, AVITHRAPID strives for the development of pre-clinical candidates targeting several viruses. This will be achieved by combining the relevant expertise  for pre-clinical drug discovery, including molecular modeling, biochemical and cell-based assays, X-ray crystallography, medicinal chemistry, biophysical binding studies, ADMETox profiling, in vitro and in vivo PK, as well as animal disease models. In addition, the consortium aims to conduct a Phase 2a clinical trial for a small molecule developed against Zika virus.   Moreover, the consortium aims to identify and validate further viral targets and thereby contribute to the search for novel antiviral targets. As a consequence of the activities in AVITHRAPID, an early-stage drug discovery pipeline will be established that can be used to rapidly identify and develop novel antiviral compounds against emerging diseases.",6,"6a, 6d"
C20317,Exploring Evolving Models of Care During the COVID19 Pandemic,"Globally alternative models of care have become essential to increase HHR capacity in both acute and critical care settings amid the COVID19 pandemic crisis. Although deploying alternative models of care (e.g. team based models of care where flexible teams practice differently from their traditional scope) were initially planned as a temporary solution to ensure the safe patient care, this approach may need to be used to manage future crises (e.g. impending nursing shortages). To date, no empirical literature on the impact of alternative models of care during COVID19 were found. Given the ongoing need to develop and adapt models of care to ensure the provision of safe care, addressing this gap is paramount. In this context, an embedded case design using a realist evaluation guided by REAIM and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research is proposed to capture models of care employed in acute care hospitals including experiences, contextual factors, measures, and lessons learned during implementation. A purposeful sampling strategy will be used to recruit participants (up to 20 per site) from regional, organizational, team, and health care providers from 4 teaching hospitals and 2 community hospitals. Data will be collected through interviews and document analyses with both deductive and inductive analyses. A comprehensive case study database will be created and undergo cross syntheses, in addition to other methodological rigor strategies. An integrated knowledge translation plan with collaborators and knowledge users will be employed. Our proposed research study aligns with CIHR's research areas of understanding the impact of COVID19 pandemic on workforce safety concerns; healthcare workforce concerns; and burnouts, resilience, and health behaviours. Study findings may inform other hospitals in their efforts to optimize safe and quality HHR and care delivery regionally, across Canada, and beyond amid COVID19 pandemic and pandemic recovery.","10, 11","10a, 11f"
P21758,Innate immune recognition and response to Rift Valley fever virus,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is widespread throughout the entire African continent and in some endemic  areas over 50% of the population is exposed by adulthood. Antiviral responses induced by interferon (IFN)  signaling can limit RVFV replication and inhibit RVFV pathogenesis in vivo. RVFV is known to infect  mononuclear phagocytic cells (MPCs), hepatocytes, and neurons, consistent with its main clinical  manifestations of acute febrile illness, hepatitis, or encephalitis. However, it is largely unknown how each of  these cell types recognizes and responds to RVFV infection or how cell type specific innate immune responses  modulate viral pathogenesis. The overall objective for this proposal is to determine how the mammalian host  innate immune system recognizes and responds to RVFV infection and how this modulates viral pathogenesis.  Our central hypothesis is that differential innate immune recognition and response by infected cells modulates  viral pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) identify the innate immune sensors and effectors active in  biologically relevant human primary cells, 2) define the contribution of key innate immune sensors and  effectors in recognition and response to RVFV infection in vivo and 3) define the role of hematopoietic cell  infection in RVFV pathogenesis in vivo. The results of this research will define the mechanisms of innate  immune recognition and response following RVFV infection. Moreover, it will inform on cell type-specific  responses to infection and how virally mediated antagonism of those responses contributes to viral  pathogenesis.",1,"1b, 1d"
P22791,Improving iPSC reprogramming and CRISPR gene editing workflows and efficacy using CellRaft technology,"Project Summary  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a commonly used tool to generate multiple cell types from  a given individual patient. Reprogramming non-invasively harvested cells, such as dermal fibroblasts, into  iPSCs, allows investigators to generate any cell type from a patient with known genetic and clinical backgrounds.  This method has been particularly powerful for cases in which a disease condition manifests in a tissue where  acquiring patient-derived primary cells is challenging, or there are genetic mutations. However, the workflows  associated with reprogramming, CRISPR gene editing, and differentiating iPSCs are low-throughput, costly,  time-consuming, and not supported by commercially available automated instrumentation. Customized  automation systems have been published and generally require considerable capital investment, multiple types  of equipment, custom programming, and commitment to a single reprogramming method. There is an unmet  need in academia and industry for technology that can improve the efficiency and success rates of a)  reprogramming, b) iPSC viability, and c) the ability to generate clonally derived CRISPR edited cell lines in an  automated fashion. The development of streamlined workflows on a single platform that can deliver higher  efficiencies in iPSC reprogramming and cell line development is likely to dramatically enhance the utility and  throughput of the technology, thereby accelerating the use of iPSCs in personalized medicine and drug  discovery. Cell Microsystems proposes the use of the CellRaft Technology, comprising the automated AIR  System and CytoSort Array cell culture consumable as a cost-effective, automated, and gentle solution that can  solve many of the pain points that plague these critical workflows. In this Phase I program, we will develop  protocols for the culture, reprogramming, and editing of iPSCs using our proprietary consumable and  instrumentation and demonstrate that our technology provides faster, more cost effective, and more efficient  workflows for iPSC cloning. Commercially, there is a tremendous potential market in laboratories across all  industries that perform these workflows, and our company has a proven successful track record in developing  tools for the drug discovery market.",6,6i
C09558,Connecting our Neighborhoods Need for Enhanced and Coordinated Testing to Achieve Equity: CoNNECT to Achieve Equality,"ABSTRACTCOVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are disparate across racial and ethnic groups in the UnitedStates (US), disproportionately impacting minority communities. Northwest Arkansas (Washington and BentonCounties) is a ""COVID-19 Hot Spot"" in the US, with the region reporting such stark racial/ethnic disparitiesrelated to COVID-19 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) came to Northwest Arkansasto investigate in June and July 2020 and then the National Institutes of Health sent investigators in earlyAugust 2020. The CDC's July 2020 report documented that 45% of all adult cases in Northwest Arkansas wereamong Hispanic/Latinx patients and 19% were Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) patients.Hispanic/Latinxs and NHPIs, only account for 17% and 2.4% of the two-county population, respectively.COVID-19 deaths in Northwest Arkansas were also disparate across race and ethnicity. NHPI deaths wereestimated to be more than 200 per 100K -much higher than the overall death ratio for the county of 5.10 per100K, as well as the death ratio for Whites of 4.03 per 100K. There is an urgent need to increase COVID-19testing and prepare for future vaccination trials, especially for the NHPI and Hispanic/Latinx communities ofNorthwest Arkansas. The uptake of current testing is low, less than 5%, and our needs assessment found thetop preferred locations identified were clinics with drive-through testing and drive-through testing in targetedhousing complex and neighborhood. We will use a community-based participatory research approach guidedby the Social Ecological Model (SEM) to target testing strategies that will have the greatest impact. Ourspecific aims are: Aim 1: leverage and fully engage our long-standing community-based partnerships toincrease COVID-19 testing and prepare for future vaccination trials; Aim 2: implement and evaluate accessand uptake strategies of two community-driven COVID-19 testing approaches to understand effectiveness andimpact for vulnerable populations; Aim 2a: evaluate which testing sites are most effective in reaching specificvulnerable populations based on age, race/ethnicity, and sex; Aim 2b: examine how social determinants ofhealth influence testing behaviors and preferred testing location; Aim 2c: conduct an implementation study todocument facilitators and barriers to implementation of community-based testing methods; and Aim 3: fullycollaborate with the RADx-UP Coordinating and Data Collection Center (CDCC) and other RADx-UP sites.

C06915,Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Alzheimer's Disease,"Project Summary/Abstract: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemichas created a healthcare crisis that was previously reserved for the accelerating Alzheimer'sdisease (AD) diagnoses. Geriatric individuals are a high risk group prone to severe infection anddeath, however, a large percentage of these individuals will survive. The predilection of SARS-CoV-2 and AD to this population indicates age-associated factors may become aggravated uponviral infection, thereby exacerbating underlying AD symptomatology. We need a betterunderstanding of the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection - particularly in relation to ADprogression.AD is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive anterogradeamnesia and eventual death. Blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption is typically observed in ADpatients leading to increased vascular permeability. This disrupted microvasculature predisposesindividuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD to increased CNS infiltration by SARS-CoV-2.Once in the CNS, SARS-CoV-2 can infiltrate host cellular components through interaction withangiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin system,expressed on hippocampal neurons, and involved with learning and memory. Downregulation ofACE2 is observed in AD patients in conjunction with elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau levels.Further internalization of this receptor upon SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism may exacerbate ADpathology and potentiate disease progression. Viral infection can also cause host cell senescenceas a defense mechanism against viral replication. The subsequent senescence-associatedsecretory phenotype (SASP) can secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines impactingneighboring cells and causing a deleterious feed-forward cycle propagating AD pathology andcognitive decline.The Aims of our current funding mechanism are designed to elucidate the role of cellularsenescence in AD. The SARS-CoV-2 emergent crisis coupled with its proclivity to infect geriatricpopulations and our scientific understanding of viral infection on senescent cell burden providesSCIENTIFIC PREMISE for the proposed studies. For this administrative supplement wehypothesize that CNS infection of SARS-CoV-2 increases senescent cell burden thus aggravatingthe development, progression, and severity of cognitive deficits in AD mouse models.Complimentary in vitro (AIM 1) and in vivo (AIM 2) assays will be used to probe the long-termconsequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on senescent cell accumulation andneuroinflammation,thereby accelerating cognitive and physical AD symptomatology.",4,4b
C20464,Young immigrants and refugees co-designing mental health and well-being solutions,"Canada is home to hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees, a large portion of which are young people. A successful settlement experience for young immigrants and refugees (YIR) is vital for the future of the country. However, YIR can face many barriers (e.g., school adjustments, social challenges, employment, housing, financial, and linguistic), in addition to racism and discrimination. These barriers can negatively impact mental health (MH) of YIR. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the issue, with MH challenges increasing for YIR. Without appropriate culturally sensitive services and supports directed at prevention or early-intervention, MH challenges will persist, becoming more severe mental disorders that are harder to treat and have long lasting consequences. It is time to re-imagine what is available for YIR and move beyond a one-size-fits all approach to create culturally sensitive services/supports, inclusive of eMental Health (eMH) options, that focus on prevention and early intervention for YIR MH and well-being. The aim of this 4-year study is to build awareness and enhance the MH and well-being of YIR in Manitoba (MB). YIR will be interviewed about their MH experiences, needs, and ideas for possible culturally sensitive solutions, as well as take part in photovoice, focus groups, and eMH workshops. YIR parents and key stakeholders from community-based organizations will also be interviewed. Short-term, the knowledge gained of YIR MH experiences and needs will be used to promote awareness of YIR MH and well-being. Concrete solutions for community-based services and supports will result for MB but also for sites across the country that can be tailored to specific YIR populations. This project will also result in a culturally sensitive, interactive eMH self-management prototype. Long-term, the culturally sensitive, interactive eMH prototype will be available for scaling up in other sites across Canada. ",10,10a
C09938,COJO for COVID recovery: Solutions-focused constructive journalism as a pandemic exit strategy for local/regional UK communities,"This project uses COVID-19 as the research situation to investigate - through a UK-wide rollout - the potential power of the novel genre of solutions-focused constructive journalism (known as COJO) in helping local/regional communities to deal with unprecedented challenges. As the public emerges out of the lockdown to face a painful and uncertain struggle to exit from the pandemic, they will need to be informed, inspired and empowered to respond to social problems in a forward-looking manner. As a rigorous evidence-based reporting framework and toolkit that shifts the focus from what is the problem to what is the solution, COJO - also called solutions journalism (SOJO) - holds a strong potential to serve that acute cause. Gathering Bournemouth University, the Association of British Science Writers, the Solutions Journalism Network and Newsquest, this project investigates the extent to which and the way in which COJO can help the UK public to transition to the ""new normal"".

C07107,"Multiplexed imaging of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) pathways, endothelial and immune dysfunction in COVID-19 Lung","PROJECT Summary: SARS-CoV2 pandemic has already taken a high toll with ~700,000 (~155,00 US) deaths and 18 million (~5 million US) infections globally with unabated spread in many countries and new hotspots reemerging on a regular basis. While frantic efforts are underway to develop vaccines and therapies and there is high hope that these will be available over the next 6-12 months, there are no answers to how much and how long these will be effective. A continued effort on understanding the disease etiology, particularly in the organ first infected, and identifying new avenues of intervention therefore is important. The major route of virus infection is via the respiratory tract and virus is reported tospread via lung to other organs by vascular leakage by directly (through infection) or indirectly (byimpairing ACE2 activity) affecting the endothelial and immune cells. Cells expressing ACE2 enzyme and other viral coreceptors (TMPRSS2 or Cathepsin L) are the major targets of viral infection. ACE2 is a key player in regulation of the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) pathway. By converting theproduct of ACE activity, angiotensin II (ang II), to angiotensin 1-7 (ang 1-7), ACE2 diminishes Ang II mediated deleterious effects that can include promoting vascular wall inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, endothelial cell and vascular smooth muscle cell migration, growth, proliferation, and thrombosis. Disruption of ACE2 by viral binding may reduce this protective effect. The inhibition of nitric oxide production, activation of megakaryocytes, complement and platelets can also cause thrombosis and thrombolytic dysfunction leading to clot formation in lung arteries and other organs.Since the early unprecedented global effort to identify the cellular targets of SARS-CoV2 using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from multiple human and non-human single cell datasets,several in depth reports on individual organs infected and cells and cellular pathways affected by this virus have appeared. Most of these reports are based on transcriptomic analysis of homogenized or disaggregated samples although some singleplex immunofluorescence analysis have been reported. COVID-19 tissue histology shows a very heterogenous disease which may be a function of multiple factors including cellular composition, spatial organization and neighboring cell activation.     To understand these factors, here we propose an in situ multiplex immunofluorescence study of SARS-CoV2 positive and negative patient samples to spatially profile the cell types affected in the upper and lower respiratory tract and the role of RAS pathway activation in endothelial and immune cell dysfunction related to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","1, 4","1b, 4a, 4b"

This K08 award will provide Dr. Richardson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to conduct clinical and social scientific investigations of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) to learn to design more effective containment strategies for emerging infectious diseases by integrating rigorous ethnographic and epidemiological evidence; (3) to become an expert in the social epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases in low-income settings; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. Dr. Richardson has a strong background in clinical infectious diseases and anthropology. This career development award will enable him to address several remaining gaps in the training specific to his career goals. Specifically, he seeks advanced training in (1) epidemiology and (2) biostatistics and will accomplish through coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health. To further achieve his training goals, Dr. Richardson has assembled a mentoring team comprised of: Primary mentors: Dr. Paul Farmer, who conducts anthropological global health research, and Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, a world renown expert in social epidemiology; Advisers: Dr. Megan Murray, an expert in infectious disease transmission dynamics, Dr. Mosoka Fallah, Director of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), and Dr. Phyllis Kanki, who has decades of virology experience in West Africa. The novel coronavirus which causes COVID-19 was first reported in Hubei Province, China in December 2019. In the ensuing 4 months, the outbreak spread to nearly every country in the world. The arrack rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggests that 50-60% or more of the global population may become infected as it assumed that nearly all are immunologically naïve. Despite the rapid development of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for detection of virus in infected patients, many questions remain about SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and transmission dynamics. This is because many infected cases remain asymptomatic albeit contagious. Moreover, many symptomatic infections go undetected on account of the slow scale-up of RT-PCR testing. These dynamics have their greatest ramifications for healthcare settings, since healthcare workers are one of the few populations that cannot practice social distancing. It is important to know the attack rate in these groups in order to improve infection prevention and control and decrease nosocomial transmission of the virus. This becomes more important in resource-constrained settings, where optimal PPE stocks are difficult to come by. Novel strategies for healthcare interactions may need to be developed in such cases. Accordingly, this study will determine the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and the attack rate amongst African healthcare workers in various settings through serosurveillance (Aim 1). It will also evaluate the role of social and epidemiologic factors in the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Aim 2). This research will form the basis for a longitudinal study of the impact of herd immunity and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollouts on future pandemic waves.","3, 7, 10","3a, 3c, 7l, 10z"
P25487,National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC) II,"In 2018, the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC) was created to explore vaccines in the UK. It was composed of scientists and doctors from six UK universities and Public Health England. With funding from the UK government, NISEC looked into new vaccines and immunisation schedules, including those for whooping cough and meningitis. NISEC also received additional funding from vaccine manufacturers to run clinical trials relevant to national UK vaccine policy, providing value for money.  From early in 2020, the NISEC team focused their efforts on urgent COVID-19 vaccine trials. These trials enrolled about 13,000 participants at 30 UK trial sites, providing important evidence for national and international health policy makers. NISEC expertise was also used to help develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which is thought to have saved 6.3 million lives worldwide in 2021.  NISEC is now seeking £6 million from the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) to continue its work.

A team of cross-institutional experts active in research related to WfH during lockdown, will employ a mixed-methods approach using an online survey, organisational case studies, and secondary analysis of national datasets. The research will explore both employer actions, practices and strategic decision-making, and employee experiences and outcomes of WfH during lockdown and its aftermath. Focusing on Professional Services and Public Administration, where access has been agreed in principle with employers in law and local government, a longitudinal perspective will contour and contextualise the recovery process in these sectors, selected for their contrasting business models, frontline pandemic response, and levels of WfH prior to the crisis-driven mass migration of white-collar workers into roles performed entirely from home.  Our impact pathway will promote early engagement with findings: offering regular insight briefings on employee experience and outcomes; an employer summit that shares and shapes our assessment of whether WfH under the pandemic is activating wider changes in work organisation, job design, agility and flexibility; and a policy roundtable informing policy responses around 'good work' and flexible working.",10,10c

The overarching objective of this project is to understand these non-intended consequences and to devise improved health, economic and social policies. In our policy recommendations, we strive to make healthcare systems and societies in the EU more resilient to pandemics in terms of prevention, protection and treatment of the population 50+, a most vulnerable part of the population.  The project aims to identify healthcare inequalities before, during and after the pandemic; to understand the lockdown effects on health and health behaviours; to analyse labour market implications of the lockdown; to assess the impacts of pandemic and lockdown on income and wealth inequality; to mitigate the effects of epidemic control decisions on social relationships; to optimise future epidemic control measures by taking the geographical patterns of the disease and their relationship with social patterns into account; and to better manage housing and living arrangements choices between independence, co-residence or institutionalisation.  The project pursues a transdisciplinary and internationally comparative approach by exploiting the data sources of the SHARE research infrastructure. It covers all EU MS. The project'Äôs team represents medicine, public health, economics and sociology and has worked together since the creation of SHARE. It is experienced in translating data analysis into concrete policy advice. The project'Äôs policy recommendation are targeted at policy makers in the Commission and in national ministries as well as at national and international NGOs and social organisations.",10,"10a, 10b, 10c, 10d"

C19777,Preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting human type II transmembrane serine protease activity,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causing COVID-19 has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization which has mobilized international scientists to collaborate in order to find therapies to counteract the virus's effects which can be devastating. The strategies need to be as vast as possible since we do not yet know if vaccines or other antiviral drugs will be efficacious. Our group had previously shown in the context of influenza infection that the human host has cell-surface proteases (called type II transmembrane serine proteases or TTSPs) that the virus requires in order to cleave a viral surface protein called hemagglutinin, itself essential for the virus to gain entry into the cell and further replicate using the host cell machinery. We had shown that small molecules inhibiting the activity of lung epithelial cell proteases were efficacious at significantly reducing influenza virulence demonstrating novel anti-viral properties of the compounds. The situation is similar with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but the protein found on the surface of the virus is different. This protein is called the spike glycoprotein (or S protein) and it requires cleavage by human host cell proteases of the TTSP family for its virulence. Our proposal will test protease inhibitors in models where cells are expressing the S protein and the most potent molecules will then be validated in lung organoids to verify their efficacy at reducing viral propagation. We have put together a team of molecular pharmacologists, chemists and virologist with access to containment level 3 facilities to rapidly assess the potential anti-viral properties of the compounds that we already have on hand. In addition, our team will be supported by Dr. Gary Whittaker, Cornell University, one of the world's expert in coronavirus biology. We believe that these conditions are very favorable for us to have a quick impact in the field and to deliver novel antiviral compounds for patients with COVID-19.",6,6a

P22119,Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),"Project Summary  In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses  (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses  within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction  and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great  concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas.  Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species  harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown.  Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and  global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health  structures in Venezuela.   The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-  NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling  approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known  arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics,  map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within  these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other  vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these  samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine  learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on  prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing  human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a  particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity.  We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human  and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.   Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health  agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence  into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity  to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential  to avert full-blown emergence.","1, 2, 3","1d, 2a, 3a, 3d"
P23071,UA Project: Advancing Vector-borne Disease Surveillance in American Indian Communities,"Project Summary/Abstract  The Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Cocopah Environmental Protection Office staff, medical entomologists from  the University of California, vector-borne disease researchers from the University of Arizona and other  community partners will build upon existing participatory research and outreach partnerships in the proposed  project.  Arizona often ranks amongst the highest in West Nile virus infection and related deaths relative to other states.  Additionally, high populations of the invasive yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti in communities along  southern border areas makes mosquito and pathogen surveillance critically important. Ae. aegypti is the  primary vector of dengue and Zika viruses which circulate in the neighboring border states of Sonora and Baja  California, Mexico. Ticks are important vectors causing human disease. Among the most significant is Rocky  Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), a bacterial infection caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, which kills more people in  North America than any other tickborne disease. Native American populations are disproportionately impacted.  Since the first locally acquired case was identified in Arizona in 2003, the disease has become endemic in  many Native American communities. In Arizona, R. rickettsii is vectored by the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus  sanguineus and to date there have been more than 436 cases of RMSF with a case fatality rate of 10%, which  is 15 times the national rate for this disease. There have been no surveillance efforts for vector or pathogen  prevalence outside of post-epidemic events.  Supportive efforts are needed to identify high-risk surveillance gaps, undertake vector and pathogen  prevalence assessments, and generate access to essential infrastructure and services in the short-term.  Vector-borne Disease Research Committees (VbDRC) within collaborating tribal communities will direct high  priority vector surveillance and inform Tribal leadership of technical findings. Creation of Vector Risk Mitigation  Plans and relevant community specific practicum training will be provided for tribal environmental health, public  health and medical practitioners serving communities. Additionally, investment in Native American students  through financially supported vector research experiences will help build the future public and environmental  health workforce. There is strong evidence that student research experiences improve educational persistence,  thus UA faculty and VbDRC members will mentor Native American students through community-based  research projects.","2, 3","2z, 3d"
P22358,"Multiplex serological assays to support arbovirus diagnosis, surveillance and vaccines","Abstract  At a global level, ongoing ecological, environmental and demographic changes favor the survival and expansion  of several mosquito and tick species that transmit arboviruses. Aedes mosquito species that thrive in urban  environments created by humans are responsible for epidemics of several flaviviruses [dengue virus (DENV)  serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4; Zika virus (ZIKV); yellow fever virus (YFV)] and alphaviruses [chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  and Mayaro virus (MAYV)]. Laboratory-based diagnosis and surveillance for arboviruses is difficult because  most infected individuals are asymptomatic or develop a mild undifferentiated febrile illness. Serological assays  have been developed for the detection of recent or past arboviral infections, but the utility of these assays is  severely limited by antibody cross reactivity between related viruses. For example, when ZIKV emerged in many  regions of the Americas where greater than 80% of the population was dengue-immune, with current serological  assays, it was difficult, if not impossible, to identify infected individuals or monitor the spread of ZIKV at a  population level, and likewise to now detect new DENV infections in areas that experienced intense ZIKV  epidemics. Our studies over the past 10 years demonstrate that people exposed to flavivirus infections reliably  develop antibodies to epitopes that are unique to each flavivirus as well as cross-reactive antibodies. Using our  discoveries about the location of immunodominant virus type-specific epitopes, we have produced novel  recombinant antigens and demonstrated their utility for the type-specific diagnosis of arboviruses. Under  Specific Aim 1 of this proposal, we will build on these discoveries to develop a sample-sparing,  microsphere bead-based multiplex assay for the type-specific and sensitive detection of recent or past  arbovirus infections. Our initial studies will focus on 8 arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes  albopictus mosquitos because these viruses share a similar ecology and co-circulate in the same human  populations. At a second stage, we will expand the coverage of the assay to detect infections with other  arboviruses transmitted by other mosquito species and ticks. Several tetravalent DENV and ZIKV vaccines are  currently being evaluated in human clinical trials. While vaccine developers have relied on neutralizing  antibodies as a correlate of protection, recent results from clinical trials demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies  alone are a poor correlate of vaccine safety and efficacy. We have identified flavivirus type- and epitope-specific  antibody responses that are better predictors than neutralizing antibodies of vaccine safety and efficacy. Under  Specific aim 2 of this proposal, we will develop a sample-sparing microsphere-based assay for the  detection of epitope-specific vaccine-induced antibody responses that are correlated with protective  immunity to each of the DENV serotypes and ZIKV. The technological advances and products from this  proposal will enhance our ability to efficiently monitor arbovirus infections at the individual and population levels  and also support the development of arbovirus vaccines.",1,"1a, 1d"

C04304,Improving Outcomes in Individuals with COVID-19 with Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibition: The COVID-RASi Trial,"Cardiovascular disease is not only the #1 killer chronically, but is also the #1 killer in COVID-19. Elderly patients with previous heart attack or stroke, or hypertension or diabetes, have high risk of getting infected. Surprisingly they also suffer 3 to 5 times the chance of dying compared to other infected patients. A clue may lie in a group of commonly used medicines, called renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocks or ARBs, usually extremely protective for our cardiovascular patients. But they have come under attack because they are suspected to increase the levels of ACE2 in the body, also part of RAS, which is the receptor for the virus, or the doorway for virus to enter our body. So are these agents safe or dangerous? This has become a major source of fear for both patients and physicians alike, and a raging controversy.     To answer this question, we analyzed data from Wuhan, and found that these agents actually to be extremely protective. This finding was also replicated in another study examining patients in Europe and America. However, these data looked backwards at events past, which can be fraught with hidden biases. Therefore, the world desperately needs a proper forward-looking trial to evaluate these agents in COVID-19.     Together with our Canadian and international partners experienced in COVID-19 research, we are starting this large trial to evaluate whether adding ACE inhibitors, or ARB's, compared to no added treatment in high risk COVID-19 patients, can decrease the chance of dying, requiring ventilators or ICU. A positive trial showing benefit will potentially save many lives in the world, using a very simple and cheap set of medications. Even if we found the medications to be safe, it will be very reassuring for millions of patients.

In this project we will ask 1,000 people with mild/moderate learning disabilities, and the carers of 500 people with severe/profound learning disabilities, about their wellbeing, health, living circumstances, the support they are getting, and the impact of COVID-19 on their lives. We will go back to people three times over the 12-month project so we can see if anything is changing over time and what is linked to better experiences for people. We will also ask extra questions about urgent issues that come up during the course of the project. These will be decided by working with collaborating organisations of people with learning disabilities and family carers, policy-makers and other organisations across the UK. We will analyse the information each time we run the survey so we, with collaborating organisations, can get information quickly to the wide range of people and organisations who can use it.",10,10a
C13808,Evaluation of the effectiveness of probiotics on post-COVID-19 conditions.,"Google translate: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 138 million people and while vaccination brings great hope, many questions remain (eg impact of variants of the virus). Studies show that patients could present symptoms up to 6 months after the acute phase (fatigue, anxiety ...). Little is known about the causes of long-lasting COVID (LONG-COV) but could be linked to persistence of the virus or inadequate immune response. Our group proposes to study the impact of the intestinal microbiota (intestinal flora) on LONG-VOC. We know that: 1) people who have a severe form of COVID-19 (elderly people, diabetics ...) often have an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, 2) COVID-19 modifies the microbiota (ex: taking of antibiotics) and 3) probiotics can improve the balance of the microbiota. We hypothesize that LONG-COV is associated with the consequences of gut microbiota imbalance and that it is possible to reduce the occurrence of LONG-COV using probiotics. As the gut microbiota is closely related to the lungs and brain, the action of probiotics could also reach other organs affected by LONG-VOC. We propose a study which compares the taking of probiotics to that of a placebo. We will include 618 men and women aged 18 and over, symptomatic of COVID-19 with a COVID + test for 10 days or less. Hospitalized patients (population at risk of LONG-VOC) may be included if they returned home within 10 days of diagnosis. The signs of the LONG-COV will be studied on the 30th and 90th day (internet or telephone). A group of volunteer patients will take samples (saliva and stool) for virus and microbiota analyzes. If successful, probiotics could be used very quickly across Canada (few side effects, affordable costs).]","4, 6","4b, 4d, 6g"
C03949,Experimentally Guided Modeling and Simulation for Cholera Dynamics,"Project Summary/AbstractThe pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently on-going with massive numbersof cases and high morbidity and mortality. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus which is nownamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Effective control strategies forCOVID-19 rely on a deep understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile,policy making in the management of the pandemic is significantly impacted by the interaction betweenthe outbreak development and the economic growth, and there is currently a paucity of researchexamining such interaction. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new mathematical andcomputational modeling framework to investigate the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the USbased on available data, and to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health and theeconomy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue two specific aims: (1) Modeling the spread andhealth impact of COVID-19; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19. The proposed research issignificant because it is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmissiondynamics, to provide realistic prediction on the development and long-term evolution of the diseaseoutbreak, and to quantify the interaction between epidemiological and economic factors under the impactof COVID-19, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic.

Elderly patients with a history of heart attack, stroke, hypertension, or diabetes have a significantly higher chance of dying compared to other infected patients. A clinical trial will be launched amongst COVID-19 patients aged 65 and older with at least one of three pre-existing conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity) to evaluate whether the use of a group of common blood pressure drugs called renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) may protect high-risk COVID-19 patients.     Preliminary evidence indicates that these drugs can be protective in high-risk patients. However, the data looked backwards at past events, which can be fraught with hidden biases. A rigorous, forward-looking trial to evaluate these agents in COVID-19 is thus required. A network of Canadian and international research institutes will evaluate whether adding RASi drugs, compared to no added treatment in high-risk COVID-19 patients, can decrease the chance of dying or requiring ventilators or intensive care units. If results confirm its benefit, using these common and inexpensive medications will potentially save many lives around the world.

C09830,"Fast, effective and low-cost molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 and strategies for large-scale population testing","The greatest success in controlling the pandemic triggered by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), called COVID-19, has been observed among countries with a great capacity to offer tests to the population, such as South Korea (Normile, 2020). However, with the growing need for inputs, often imported, for testing, countries capable of redirecting the domestic industry to produce their own inputs have managed to satisfactorily alleviate the demand for tests, as is the case of Germany, South Korea and Singapore (Editorial in Nature) (2020). However, most countries do not have the technological capacity to be self-sufficient in the production of tests, particularly the RT-qPCR test by TaqMan®, which is mostly used and recommended by the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) (Reusken et al., 2020). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop tests that use alternative inputs and that, ideally, are at the same time fast, efficient and of low cost. In Brazil, dependence on the import of inputs has been one of the main limitations for carrying out the diagnostic tests for COVID-19, as it at the same time delays and makes the process more expensive. In view of these limitations, our proposal is to develop a method based on molecular biology with the RT-LAMP methodology (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification; RT-LAMP), which does not depend on sophisticated equipment and can be performed anywhere in the country, even in those with little infrastructure (Hong et al., 2004; Lamb et al., 2020; Shirato et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, we will produce the enzymes necessary for the test. We will also test the sensitivity of the test with pools of 5 to 20 samples together, which could make it possible to increase the screening of a large number of cases and identify population groups at higher risk.

C15372,Defining the Translocation Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 Helicase to Aid in Antiviral Development,"Project Summary  SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has infected more than 103M people worldwide (February  2021) with more than 2.25M deaths, and represents a dire threat to the health and economic well-being of the  entire world. Although vaccines seem to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, recent information regarding  potential vaccine resistant strains highlights the importance of alternative strategies to combat this virus. The  development of antiviral therapeutics on important mutation resistant viral proteins such as nsp13 is one such  strategy. Improved knowledge of the molecular mechanisms utilized by nsp13 are necessary to rationally  develop inhibitors. This project will address this deficiency utilizing an integrated multiscale modeling, protein  crystallography, and biochemical approach to define how SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase binds RNA and ATP  substrates, transduces energy during ATP binding and hydrolysis, and changes conformation during ligand  binding and catalysis. We propose the following: 1) Identification of molecular-level components of the RNA-  binding and translocation mechanisms of nsp13. Preliminary all-atom molecular dynamics (aaMD) simulations  of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 have identified key protein-RNA interactions that will inform initial mutagenesis studies.  Further simulation and protein crystallography will inform on the ATP-dependent protein-RNA interactions  observed in the RNA cleft. Biochemical experiments will be performed to test the structure-function  hypotheses generated by the structural-based approaches. 2) Identification of molecular-level features of the  binding, hydrolysis and product release of ATP by nsp13. We have performed aaMD simulations of the SARS-  CoV-2 nsp13 in all relevant substrate states. Soaked-in ATP and non-hydrolysable analogue protein  crystallography will be performed to test these initial models. Subsequent quantum mechanical calculations  will identify key components of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis and well-established  enzyme kinetics assays will be used to test effects predicted by these simulations. 3) Identification of allosteric  networks in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 that transduce energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to perform RNA  translocation. Utilizing network analyses of aaMD simulations, Motif V has been identified as a key allosteric  contributor. Biochemical studies will be performed to verify that Motif V is necessary for nsp13 helicase  function. Further work will be done to identify allosteric networks between additional components of the ATP  pocket and RNA cleft identified in Aims 2 and 3. This work will produce unprecedented molecular-level insight  into the translocation mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicases. Key components of this mechanism  represent new targets for antiviral development.",1,"1b, 1c"

In early April, more than 1 million cases were reported. confirmed and there are no signs of slowdown in transmission. Brazil, with more than 10,000 cases as of the beginning of April 2020, is the most affected country in Latin America and its daily growth of confirmed cases is on an equal footing with the rest of the world. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently after infection by intracellular pathogens and has been described as occurring in severe coronavirus infections caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Through a direct effect of viral capsule proteins like viroporin 3a, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated generating damage and rupture of the cell membrane. This process is further intensified with the activation of caspase-1 and production of gasdermine D and interleukin 1B (IL1B). In addition, cell death results in the release of DAMPs in neighboring cells and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus propagating the extent of the damage. In this context, reaching the inflammatory cascade and pyroptosis is potentially a viable way to control host injury in cases of severe COVID-19. Diacerein and its active metabolite, the reign, decreases the production of IL-1B AND cell death from pyroptosis by inhibiting caspase-1 E can also inhibit IL-6 production. The attenuation of the production of these inflammatory cytokines has the potential to decrease the severity of the disease, especially in those who are hospitalized with COVID-19. In cell models, the inflammatory response to IL-1B is completely reversed with diacerein treatment. In a rat model of acute sepsis-induced inflammation, diacerein reduced caspase activity and nuclear factor kappa B. Currently, there are no studies on the effect of diacerein on the acute inflammatory response in humans. However, when extrapolating human model data andin vitroin animals for patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19, it can be postulated that the attenuation of pyroptosis and inflammatory activation may be a clinical benefit for these patients. Diacerein has been on the market for approximately 20 years and has been approved for use in osteoarthritis and other inflammatory conditions such as Epidermolysis Bullosa. It is accessible and well tolerated by patients with rare cases of gastrointestinal disorder. For this, 300 patients will be enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which diacerein treatment will be tested. The primary outcome will be time to clinical worsening, defined as the time from randomization to mortality or worsening of the World Health Organization (WHO) progression scale.",6,"6g, 6h"
P21618,Origin of the innate immunity suppression caused by nairovirus' protease activity,"Summary/Abstract  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever,  prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5-  80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities.  Originally identified in Russia and the Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of  Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, CCHFV has illustrated its continued ability to spread into  previously naive regions. At the same time, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the  regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South-Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk  for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the  only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses  Issyk-kul, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. There  is no vaccine or prophylactic currently available for treatment of CCHF or any other nairovirus related  disease. Reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located  within the nairovirus genome. Recently, vOTUsÃ¢Â€Â™ ability to reverse post-translational modification by  proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15) on a narrow subset of host  pathways has been illustrated to be critical to pathogenesis. Also, vOTUs from CCHFV and other  nairoviruses have been found to be sensitive to species-species variations in ISG15 and their  specificity includes at least the species that disease is most prominently identified. This proposal will  determine the identity of specific host proteins within those pathways targeted by vOTUs. This will  enable therapeutic approaches that protect, or elevate, specific host inhibitory factors for these  viruses. The proposal will also seek to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate  species-specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence and zoonotic range of the  nairoviruses in question. Additionally, the efficacy of using CCHFV vaccine candidates with altered  CCHF vOTU functions will be assessed. Together, the resulting information will provide critical insight  into the role of vOTUs play in pathogenesis and host restriction as well as advance the development  of prophylactics targeting vOTUs.","1, 4, 6, 7","1b, 1c, 4b, 6g, 7i"

C19762,Neutralizing human-derived single-chain antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that has caused an epidemic of human respiratory disease (COVID-19). It first emerged from the city of Wuhan in Hubei in December 2019 and has since spread widely in China and to more than 24 counties globally. The virus has been declared as a deadly global threat, and accelerated international efforts have been engaged to control the virus. A total of 1,524 deaths been confirmed as of 15th February 2020 (WHO). As a result of the rapid transmission internationally, a global call to control the spread of the virus in affected and non-affected areas has been implemented. Currently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine to control the virus. Symptoms of the infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause respiratory failure, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. The objectives of this application are 1) to develop antibodies that will block the entrance of the virus into the cells, and to test the efficacy of these antibodies in mice.",6,6a

P22913,Visualization of Influenza Viral RNA Assembly,"Influenza  A  viruses  (IAV)  pose  a  major  public  health  threat  through  both  seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. The segmented nature of the viral genome promotes reassortment,  a  process  where  the  genetic  material  between  viruses  is  exchanged  in  a co-Ã'Â­infected cell. In nature, reassortment leads to increased viral diversity and emergence of  pandemic  influenza  viruses.  For  example,  the  2009  influenza  H1N1  (Ã¢Â€Â˜swine  fluÃ¢Â€Â™) pandemic virus, emerged from reassortment of two circulating swine viruses. Prediction of future pandemic influenza viruses from circulating zoonotic virus populations is difficult because  very  little  is  known  about  the  mechanism  of  reassortment  within  a  single co-infected cell. To accurately define the process of reassortment, we must first understand the  dynamics  of  intracellular  viral  RNA  (vRNA)  assembly.  Influenza  vRNA  replicates  in the  nucleus  and  is  transported  to  the  plasma  membrane  for  packaging,  which  requires one  copy  of  all  eight  segments  to  assemble  within  a  single  virion  to  produce  a  fully infectious  virus.  In  this  proposal,  we  will  build  upon  our  previous  data  on  influenza assembly  and  define  1)  the  assembly  dynamics  in  physiologically  relevant  human  and swine cell types, 2) the cellular proteins modulating vRNA transport, and 3) the location of reassortment within a co-Ã'Â­infected cell. Our central hypothesis is that vRNA assembly occurs  in  a  cell-Ã'Â­type  specific  manner  that  correlates  with  IAV  reassortment  in  different host  species.  The  Specific  Aims  of  this  application  will  use  a  variety  of  sophisticated microscopy  tools,  including  live  cell  imaging  with  a  custom  light-Ã'Â­sheet  microscope,  to determine  the  assembly  mechanism  in  various  cell  culture  models.  Aim  1  will  utilize multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization and live cell imaging techniques to explore the dynamics of influenza vRNA assembly in human and swine differentiated airway epithelial cells.  Aim  2  will  uncover  the  identity  and  roles  of  cellular  cytoskeletal  proteins  and membranous  organelles  utilized  during  influenza  vRNA  assembly  using  biochemical approaches  like  proximity-Ã'Â­dependent  biotinylation.  Aim  3  will  combine  imaging  and genomic  approaches  to  characterize  the  cellular  location  of  vRNA  intermingling  during co-infection  with  two  heterologous  viruses  in  differentiated  airway  epithelial  cells.  The proposed  work  will  address  many  outstanding  questions  in  influenza  biology  regarding reassortment  that  have  remained  unanswered  due  to  a  lack  of  tools  to  track  vRNA movement in live cells during a productive infection. In addition, these studies will identify novel  host  factors  involved  in  vRNA  packaging  that  can  be  pursued  as  potential therapeutic targets.",1,"1b, 1c, 1e"

Our proposal is built on an existing network of laboratories/epidemiologists in  close contact with national healthcare systems. We will identify factors influencing emergence and  transmission at the virus, vector and reservoir level, leading to epidemics in suspected spillover conditions.  We will focus on high priority RNA viruses with epidemic potential in Africa (Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV),  Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV)) and in Southeast Asia (dengue virus (DENV)) as well  as viruses (Disease X) identified from symptomatic surveillance or insect sampling. We will tackle problems  in emerging infectious diseases by the following specific aims: 1) Enhance surveillance and detect  unknown RNA viruses with potential for spillover to humans. We will implement an autonomous  solar-powered mobile suitcase laboratory for rapid pathogen identification in the field. Connection to a  cloud computing system will facilitate data analysis and sharing among healthcare centers and laboratories.  We will survey pathogens present in insects in different ecological settings. We will develop new diagnostic  tools for these viruses and conduct prevalence and behavioral studies in human populations to determine  risk factors. 2) Understand transmission dynamics of endemic RNA viruses with high risk of  outbreak. We will focus on RVFV and CCHFV in Senegal and Cameroun, and DENV in Cambodia. We will  perform surveys in animals and humans using a more specific multiplex assay. We aim at obtaining better  knowledge on prevalence, transmission dynamics, and identifying major insect vectors and animal  reservoirs. 3) Understand factors influencing adaptation of RNA viruses to new hosts. We will use  state of the art technology to generate and study key candidate viral mutations using cells from relevant  species including humans. We will study efficacy of these viruses in infection of various strains of insects to  estimate transmission risks. This aim will lead to better understanding of the adaptation of these viruses to  new hosts and will help design more detection methods. Lastly, 4) Study of host adaptive immune  responses to emerging infectious diseases in South-East Asia and Africa. We will increase our insight  into the adaptive immune response at a single cell level and the sequence-function relationship of human  antibodies generated during infectious diseases (DENV, RVFV, CCHFV) by combining sequencing at a  single cell level with antibody repertoire analysis. We will study function and characterize structure at a  single antibody level. We will provide novel understanding of the role of cellular immunity in DENV disease.  The proposed activity will allow the implementation of infrastructure and an analysis pipeline for outbreak  preparedness in areas where viruses with potential pandemic threats circulate.","1, 3","1a, 1b, 1d, 3d"
P22828,Sickness and Power: The Great North American Epizootic Flu of 1872,"Project Summary   The recent outbreak of COVID-19 and the upswing in seasonal influenza this winter offer  pressing reminders of the enduring, even intensifying dangers that emergent zoonotic diseasesÃ¢Â€Â""  disorders caused by pathogens that jump across species dividesÃ¢Â€Â""pose to human health. Historians  of medicine and other scholars have long recognized the power of such diseases to shape human  history. Yet few works in epidemiological history have attended to the complicated relationships that  continue to link pathogens, humans, other-than-human animals, and the natural and built ecosystems  that connect the livesÃ¢Â€Â""and, often, the deathsÃ¢Â€Â""of these disparate organisms. This proposal seeks to  remedy this gap by supporting the completion of a Geographic Information System (GIS) and  scholarly book examining the Great Epizootic Influenza of 1872. This little-known disease event  began in TorontoÃ¢Â€Â™s market-farming hinterland, where the continuous exchange of pathogens between  humans, horses, other farm animals, and wild waterfowl set the stage for the evolution of a new and  unprecedentedly virulent form of influenza A virus. Within weeks, swarms of the new virus had  engulfed metropolitan Toronto. It took just another month for the disease to spread throughout  southeastern Canada and the northeastern U.S. By summer 1873, flu had sickened well over 90% of  the horses, mules, and asses in the U.S., Canada, Cuba, Mexico, the Indigenous Nations of the  West, and parts of Central America. As it achieved continental proportions, the Great Epizootic  prompted economic paralysis, debate about the maladyÃ¢Â€Â™s nature and treatment, and more than a little  soul-searching over human use and misuse of Ã¢Â€Âœthe noble horse.Ã¢Â€Â Although the disease seemed to  dissipate in fall 1873, recent scientific studies strongly suggest that the new flu type responsible for  the Great Epizootic lived on and continued to adapt. Descendants of this viral type went on to develop  the ability to infect human populations, too, most notably in the Great Pandemic of 1918-Ã¢Â€Â™20, a  worldwide influenza outbreak that killed at least 50 million people. This proposal supports research in  historical documents, the integration of evidence from these primary sources into a Geographic  Information System (GIS), and the completion of a scholarly book that casts the Great Epizootic Flu  as an unheralded but momentous event in disease history. Employing methodologies and findings  from virology, evolutionary ecology, animal behavior, environmental history, and other fields, and  adopting a transnational perspective that tracks this outbreak across regional, national, and tribal  boundaries, this book offers fresh insights into the past, present, and future of influenza and the many  other infectious diseases that don novel configurationsÃ¢Â€Â""and hence new powers to endanger human  and animal health alikeÃ¢Â€Â""by passing from species to species.","2, 3, 10","2a, 3d, 10b, 10c"
P21564,Role of Host Angiomotin as a Central Regulator of Filovirus Egress and Dissemination,"Filoviruses (Ebola [EBOV] and Marburg [MARV]) and arenaviruses (e.g. Lassa virus; LAFV) are zoonotic, emerging pathogens that cause outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. A fundamental understanding of the virus-host interface is critical for developing future strategies and countermeasures for therapeutic intervention. As the filovirus VP40 and LAFV Z matrix proteins drive virion assembly and egress, in part, by hijacking specific host proteins containing WW-domains that can interact with their highly conserved PPxY L-domain motifs, these interactions represent a novel therapeutic target to inhibit egress and dissemination of these hemorrhagic fever viruses. Our early studies to identify host WW-domain proteins that regulate filovirus and arenavirus budding identified the E3 ubiquitin ligases Nedd4, ITCH, and WWP1 as positive regulators of viral PPxY-mediated budding. However, in more recent studies, we identified WW-domain containing proteins YAP/TAZ, BAG3, and now WWOX (WW Domain Containing Oxidoreductase; a multi-functional tumor suppressor), as negative regulators of PPxY-mediated egress of VP40 and Z VLPs. The identification of YAP/TAZ, BAG3, and WWOX as negative regulators of viral PPxY-mediated budding is particularly intriguing since all three of these proteins interact with Angiomotin (Amot), a multi-PPxY containing protein that functions as a Ã¢Â€Âœmaster regulatorÃ¢Â€Â of Hippo pathway (YAP/TAZ) signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration/proliferation, and tight junction (TJ) integrity. Moreover, expression and stability of Amot itself are regulated by PPxY/WW-domain interactions with the Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Thus, we hypothesize that Amot is a central interactor linking both the positive and negative WW-domain containing regulators of virus egress, and that modular mimicry between viral and host PPxY motifs and the competitive nature of their binding to the same host WW-domain containing proteins will have a major impact on both cellular processes and viral replication and pathogenesis. Indeed, we were first to report that expression of endogenous Amot positively regulates PPxY-mediated egress of EBOV and MARV VP40 VLPs as well as egress and spread of live EBOV and MARV in cell culture. In this proposal, we will build upon our novel finding that PPxY-containing Amot can positively regulate egress and spread of PPxY-containing viruses including EBOV and MARV, and determine whether the competitive PPxY/WW-domain interplay among VP40/Z Ã¢Â€Â"" Amot Ã¢Â€Â"" host WW-domain interactors regulates egress of VLPs and live viruses in vitro and in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will provide novel insights into how this complex network of modular PPxY/WW-domain interactions with Amot impacts late stages of hemorrhagic fever virus egress and dissemination and serve as proof-of principle for therapeutic strategies targeting an essential viral-host interaction that may represent an Achilles heel for numerous RNA viruses.",1,1b

C01106,Rescuing a `Sick' Labour Market: Using Online Vacancy Data to Track COVID-19's Economic Impact.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause the worst recession the world economy has experienced since the Great Depression. Millions of people have already lost their jobs, and the functioning of the labour market has been profoundly disrupted by social distancing measures. In this context, it is fundamental to quantify the impact of the pandemic on job creation. This project will use a unique data set of daily online job postings to provide answers to key questions: which firms and sectors are expanding or contracting during the pandemic? Which jobs are being demanded? What skills and tasks are required in these jobs and how are work activities being delivered? How fast will the dynamics of job creation change as lockdown measures are eased? To answer these questions, our project will carry out an articulated analysis, employing multiple econometric techniques.  Firstly, we will provide a detailed descriptive analysis on the evolution of job creation across occupations, sectors, and regions in order to deliver essential insights on the economic consequences of the pandemic, including the crucial distributive impacts across regions and types of jobs. Second, we will make use of advanced techniques in text analysis to study the wording of job postings in order to shed light on whether and how the structure of jobs changes as a result of the COVID-19 shock. In light of the intensity of the COVID-19 induced economic disruption, we may expect to see persistent structural changes to the design of work activities and the remuneration patterns associated with different jobs. The granular and high frequency data that we will employ will allow us to comprehensively assess the occurrence and importance of such changes. Finally, we plan to identify the firm-level characteristics that play a crucial role in ensuring firms' production continuity, and labour demand resilience. Among other factors, the degree of automated work may be crucial to ensure firms' production continuity under lockdown restrictions. For example, robots assembling product components or production processes that are compatible with remote work may allow firms to remain more active while social distancing measures are in place.  Coupled with a detailed analysis on the skills demanded, the study will be provide essential inputs for the design and roll-out of targeted interventions that support the most severely affected areas, jobs and industries. These inputs will also be useful for the informing longer run investment decisions on skill training programs and government assistance.",10,10c
P25540,The Association of The Built Environment with Metabolomics and Cancer Risk,"Cancers have been the leading cause of death in Canada at least since the early 2000s. The built environment is the infrastructure and its layout made by humans such as urban green spaces, road networks, and residential and commercial establishments, and there is a growing interest in studying its effect on health, including the risk of cancer. Built infrastructure, such as recreational spaces and walking paths, have resulted in increased physical activity promoting a healthier lifestyle. However, improved infrastructure with increased road connectivity, sidewalk completeness, and access to parks could be associated with increased population density and accompanying negative consequences such as increased pollution levels. Environmental exposures such as air pollution, the extent of greenness and ambient light at night, and modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol intake have been shown to influence the risk of cancer. These environmental and lifestyle factors also affect the levels of metabolites, which are small-molecule biochemicals, such as proteins, in the human body. Metabolites are closely related to disease characteristics and are routinely used for diagnosis, studying disease processes, and discovering disease pathways, including those related to cancer. The study aims to combine data from the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (CanPath), the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE), and the Where Matters: Health & Economic Benefits Study to investigate the combined effect of the built environment and lifestyle factors on the risk of breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers in British Columbia and Alberta.

Infusion of convalescent plasmaprophylactically could immunize health care workers against nascent infections and therapeutic infusion coulddecrease the likelihood of severe disease in infected patients. As a result, several academic medical centersacross the nation have begun trials to use convalescentplasma to treat patients, with many hospitals in NewYork starting treatments this week.Given the potential for broad implementation of convalescent plasma therapy in the US in the coming weeksthere is an urgent need to evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic ability of convalescent plasma as a stand-alone treatment against COVID-19 using an animal model where timing and dose of infection can be controlled;immunopathology to organ systems can be rigorously assessed by collection of tissue biopsies, and where re-challenge experiments can critically evaluate long-term impact of convalescent plasma therapy on protectiveimmunity.The goals of this study are to determine if human plasma from convalescent COVID 19 patients preventsprimary infection, decreases viremia in the event of breakthrough infections, and alters susceptibility toa secondary challenge.

Recent surveys have established that vaccine  disinformation is impacting negatively citizen trust in COVID-19 vaccination specifically. As a  response, the UK Government agreed with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube measures to limit the  spread of disinformation. However, simply removing disinformation from platforms is not enough,  as the government also needs to monitor and respond to the concerns of vaccine hesitant citizens.  Moreover, manual detection and tracking of disinformation, as currently practiced by many  journalists, is infeasible, given the scale of social media.    XAIvsDinfo aims to address these gaps through novel research on explainable AI-based models for  large-scale analysis of vaccine disinformation. Specifically, vaccine disinformation will be classified  automatically into the six narrative types defined by First Draft. A second model will categorise  vaccine statements as pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, or other.  We will investigate explainable machine learning approaches that are human interpretable: both  in detecting errors and weaknesses of the models and in providing human-readable explanations  of the models' decisions.    XAIvsDisinfo will also create two new multi-platform datasets and organise a new community  research challenge on cross-platform analysis of vaccine disinformation, as follow-up from our  RumourEval one.

P22407,Elucidating the structural determinants of odor specificity in insect olfactory receptors,"Project Summary  The sense of smell provides animals with vital information about their environment. At the molecular level,  olfactory stimuli consist of thousands of distinct small molecules that share no common chemical feature other  than being volatile. To contend with this diversity, insects and mammals alike have evolved large families of  olfactory receptors (ORs) that operate in a combinatorial way, whereby some receptors are broadly activated by  many different odorants and others are exquisitely tuned to a specific compound. The molecular mechanisms  that endow ORs with such diverse ligand-binding properties remain unknown, largely because the isolation and  structural characterization of ORs has been a decades-long technological challenge. Using cryo-electron  microscopy, I recently determined the first atomic-resolution structure of an insect OR bound to an odor. By  determining the structures of additional insect ORs with broad and specific ligand-binding properties, the  proposed research project will elucidate the molecular mechanism of odor detection and discrimination.  To this end, the K99 mentored phase (Aim 1) will reveal the atomic structures of two primitive insect ORs with  different ligand specificities unbound and in complex with multiple odor ligands, shedding light on the molecular  determinants that underlie broad or specific odor selectivity. Next, the R00 independent phase (Aim 2) will focus  on ORs from disease-carrying mosquitoes that participate in human host-seeking. These ORs exhibit small  polymorphisms that drastically affect their ability to detect human odors. Elucidation of the atomic structure of  these mosquito ORs bound to human volatiles will illuminate the molecular properties that enable mosquitoes to  detect and prey on humans. Together, this research program will lend fundamental insight into the normal  function of sensory processing of olfactory information. Additionally, as insect ORs are critically involved in  human host-seeking that facilitates the spread of insect-borne diseases, this work will provide a foundation for  the development of novel insect repellents that could curb diseases such as malaria, Zika, and dengue fever.  The proposed development plan complements my training in structural biology and biophysics with  computational modeling of receptor-ligand interactions and in vivo assays in Drosophila. At the end of the  mentored phase, I will be equipped with the necessary tools to conduct comprehensive structural and functional  studies of odor detection and discrimination by insect vectors of disease. To achieve these goals, I will take  advantage of the extensive resources of the Rockefeller University, the mentorship of Dr. Vanessa Ruta and the  appointment of an Advisory Committee that will lend expertise in key aspects of the project and career  development.

C17911,Rapid air and surface disinfection using dry hydrogen peroxide,"We have formulated a catalyst capable of generating gas phase H2O2 (or dry hydrogen peroxide (DHP)) in significant concentrations (Akram et al. Chem. Sci., 2016, 7, 5833) using very dilute hydrogen concentrations of H2 in air at ambient temperature. Sub ppm levels of DHP are known to be highly effective in disinfecting airborne pathogens and two companies (Synexis and CASPR; https://synexis.com/; https://casprgroup.com/ ) have commercialised devices for disinfecting air with DHP procured and synthesised non-catalytically. We now propose an innovative catalytic approach.     Our innovations in liquid phase H2O2 synthesis (Europe 17728642.4; 14753141.2; 16704892.5; US 9340423) has proven enhanced disinfection is achieved when H2O2 is synthesised using a catalyst. Simultaneous to H2O2 production, highly reactive short-lived oxygen species are also formed, and results in improved pathogen kill by over a million-fold compared to commercial H2O2 alone. We consider that a similar enhancement will result from a catalytic approach to DHP formation.    We aim to utilise this discovery to design a novel catalysed route to DHP to disinfect air and surfaces in occupied spaces. We will use electricity to electrolyse water to produce low concentrations of hydrogen which is subsequently reacted with air over the gold-palladium catalyst producing gaseous DHP in such a way that all the hydrogen is totally consumed. The aim is to continually generate DHP at sub ppm levels (a maximum of 1ppm (1.4 mg H2O2 / cubic meter) of H2O2 averaged over a 8 hour period is allowed) and introduce this into flowing air that will disinfect both the air and surfaces. While the immediate focus is tackling the current Covid-19 pandemic the project aims to tackle the longer term and ongoing need for continuous air and surface disinfection for a range of pathogens",5,5b

P26465,"A platform for developing mutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies for future viral variants, using SARS-CoV-2 as a model","Globally, as of August 2023, there have been an estimated 769 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and over 6.95 million deaths. COVID-19 provides a sobering case study of the consequences of insufficient pandemic preparedness. Novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus now continue to emerge and escape immunity by either previous infection or vaccination, resulting in repeated infection with potentially serious consequences. All historical precedents indicate that future outbreaks will continue to occur. In this research program, we will pursue a preventative program against future pandemics, by developing rationally designed therapeutics that are robust to viral mutation, and thus effective in preparation for future pandemics. We will develop antibody and vaccine immunogen therapeutics that exploit unconventional strategies to remain effective in spite of the rapid mutation of the virus. We design antibodies that will remain effective in blocking the virus from entering cells so long as the virus uses the same cell receptor on its entry pathway. The vaccine immunogen candidates we design will target a portion of the virus that is conserved and unlikely to mutate because it is functionally necessary. We will test the efficacy of these therapeutics against live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in mice, where these therapeutics are expected to provide sustained protection against all strains of SARS-CoV-2. We have also developed a safe ""pseudovirus"" platform where the spike protein of the virus can mutate. In our proposed experiments, our therapeutics are again expected to remain effective as the pseudovirus mutates, while conventional therapeutics will be expected to gradually lose efficacy. The above powerful development platform provides a strategy for generating pre-emptive therapeutics that can be pivoted to future outbreaks of other novel viruses. Extending our SARS-CoV-2 studies, we will apply it to other related viruses with pandemic potential.",6,6a
C06706,Preventing Opioid Exposure Training (POET) for First Responders,"PROJECT SUMMARY/Abstract: In this competitive revision Phase I SBIR, Gryphon Scientific proposes to expand the scope of theongoing project to support the urgent need to develop and deploy training for first responderpopulations at risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The ongoing Phase I SBIRproject focuses on training first responders (including law enforcement, fire, and EMS personnel) torecognize and manage the risks of occupational opioid exposures. The training video format waschosen following formative research interviews with first responders, which revealed a clearpreference for training that could be administered to groups during short stand-up briefings. Currently,training content specifically includes topics such as routes of opioid exposure, PPE, situationalawareness, and recognizing and responding to exposure events. In this supplemental application,Gryphon proposes to expand the scope of the study by developing similar training videos on topicsrelated to the transmission of respiratory diseases, primarily focused on COVID-19. Specific topicsmay include pathogen fundamentals, transmission routes, and recommended measures to managerisk, including distancing measures when feasible, and the selection of appropriate personalprotective equipment (PPE) for various situations, including those where shortages preclude the useof recommended PPE. Recognizing the urgent need to deploy this training to the first respondercommunity, videos would be published as free and ad-supported on YouTube immediately followingtheir development. These videos could be used as standalone just-in-time training, as refreshersthroughout the pandemic, or as multimedia supplements to longer, more comprehensive e-learningcourses to reinforce key principals using a dynamic and engaging medium.Even before the pandemic, educators and researchers called for enhanced pathogen literacy in thegeneral public as an essential component of pandemic preparedness. This study proposes to collectvaluable data on learners' understanding of pathogen safety fundamentals and the potential efficacyof remote educational approaches to enhance microbiological literacy. Usability testing andknowledge retention (both immediately after training and three months later) research will beintegrated into the base Phase I study by testing these videos at the same time as those on opioidexposures. The initial products developed in this study may directly improve microbiological literacyamong at-risk populations, and these early studies may help to inform future training interventions.","5, 12","5c, 12a"

C00902,Novel long noncoding RNAs in the airway mucous response,"Airway epithelial cells or AECs orchestrate the pulmonary immune responses to airborne viral infections anddrive the successful resolution of infection. Among the immediate early responders that set the tone for innateimmune response, we have identified that as early as half-an-hour of insult, the long noncoding RNA species(lncRNAs) are deployed by the AECs to modulate the epithelial inflammatory response. Specifically, in AECs,we identified a few novel lncRNAs that modulate the expression of inflammatory factors and of ligand/receptorsthat help recruit immune cells. As with the other acute viral infections, a balanced early epithelial responseprovides timely recruitment of appropriate immune cells to thwart the infection and resolve the lung tissueremodeling. However, hosts with hyperreactive or compromised lung mucosal immunity, suffer from higher lungtissue damage, impaired lung functions and overall poor health outcome, as noted in several cases of COVID-19 patients. Overarching goal is to identify and characterize the early host immunomodulatory factors that mightpredispose to severe hyperinflammatory state to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 disease. The studies proposed will provide novel insight into theimmediate early susceptibility factors of upper airway epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 that contribute to adysregulated inflammatory response. Specifically, the archived biological samples from COVID-19 patients willbe analyzed to establish the association of expression levels of the novel lncRNA and SARS-CoV-2 receptors(ACE2 and TMPRSS2) among individuals with various degree of COVID-19 disease severity. The fixed cytospinsand cell pellets will be analyzed for host cellular (lncRNA and receptors) and viral (Spike protein) factors; andwill be validated by qPCR analysis. We will confirm the role of lncRNA by molecular gene editing in AECs culturedin-vitro and treated with a pseudovirions expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein and validated in separate studiesusing SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate for infection. Levels of inflammatory factors will be analyzed by multianalyteassays. This proof of concept study will help establish the association of novel lncRNAs with COVID-19pathophysiology that could serve as early biological indicators (biomarkers) of airway immune dysregulation andother comorbidities. Molecular studies will also help determine whether targeting the novel lncRNA can helpreduce or suppress SARS-CoV-2 mediated airway inflammatory responses.",1,1d
P22841,Kaiser Washington Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit,"Abstract  Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to human health, with many types of infections having  far-reaching, global consequences. The ability to develop vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics to  prevent, treat, and identify infectious diseases is a critical public health need. Clinical trials are an integral  component of these development efforts. Since the 1960s the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units  (VTEUs) have conducted trials that have evaluated promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates for infectious  diseases such as influenza (including pandemic and avian influenza), malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal  infection, in children and adults. In addition, the VTEUs have quickly launched trials in response to newly  emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, and Waves 1 and  5 of the H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks in China. These efforts have provided data that informed public health  policy.  This proposal is in response to a new VTEU structure which will involve greater collaboration between the  VTEUs, NIAID, and the newly formed Leadership Group structure that are all part of the NIAID Infectious  Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). The IDCRC will enhance integration and efficiency of  operations and, importantly, will foster the collaborative team science approaches now recognized as optimal  to address important and complicated public health research priorities.  Under the new cooperative agreement, the Kaiser Washington VTEU will continue to conduct clinical research  and trials, including trials conducted under an IND or IDE, within the Kaiser Washington integrated care system  to contribute to the priority research foci of NIAID. These priority areas include malaria, influenza and other  respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections and include clinical trials, including human challenge models,  and pharmacokinetic studies. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Seattle area infectious  disease research partners who will provide scientific expertise, specialized facilities, and advanced  immunologic laboratory capabilities. The Kaiser Washington VTEU will also develop and maintain surge  capacity for clinical site, pharmacy and laboratory operations to enable the rapid initiation of clinical trials and  other studies in response to emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats of public health importance.","4, 6, 7","4e, 6j, 7j"
C19721,Indigenous Approaches to Wellness & Psychotherapy as a Response to the COVID-19 Mental Health Crisis in Indigenous Communities,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a dramatic increase in rates of mental health issues, overdose, suicide, and violence in Indigenous communities in Canada. Existing mental health services are inadequate in addressing this mental health crisis, particularly given the general ineffectiveness of mainstream approaches to mental health in Indigenous communities. Numerous studies and reports are calling for community-driven approaches to wellness and psychotherapy that support Indigenous communities in culturally relevant ways, yet many communities do not have the resources to support such approaches. In response to this literature and the immediate needs of communities in central Alberta, community stakeholders from the Rocky Mountain House region of Alberta are requesting support bringing in Indigenous psychotherapy alongside traditional wellness practices. The current study will explore community members' experiences of Indigenous Focusing-Oriented Therapy as they complete the program, and will further explore the development, implementation, and impact of community-driven cultural wellness programs in addressing the COVID-19 mental health crisis in the Rocky Mountain House region. Research conversations and focus groups will explore the impact of IFOT and cultural wellness programs on the COVID-19 mental health crisis in these communities. Findings will inform development of community-based wellness responses to the COVID-19 mental health crisis that incorporate both traditional approaches to wellness and Indigenous psychotherapy. Themes will be used to develop a framework that other Indigenous communities may draw on in creating effective community-based health initiatives. This research directly supports community-based capacity to respond to mental health crises, and will provide a foundation for further research to investigate the effectiveness of IFOT and cultural programs in addressing the mental health needs of Indigenous communities.","10, 9","10b, 9b"
P26335,Understanding susceptibility and permissiveness to mpox virus across diverse mammalian species,"Mpox, is a re-emerging disease caused by the mpox virus. Since May 2022, there was a multi-country outbreak of mpox in several regions of the world. Although the disease is transmitted from primarily from animals to humans, regular human-human spread has been recently observed making the transmission more than sporadic. Epidemiologic and molecular evidence indicate that mpox virus is found in animals including squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, and different species of monkeys. Thus, there is an urgent need to characterize the range of non-human mammalian hosts that could potentially be reservoirs for mpox virus. The main aim of our proposal will be to identify and validate the range of these reservoirs for mpox virus, and to characterize the innate antiviral immune responses of these mammalian species. Our research will specifically elucidate the susceptibility (supporting entry of virus into cells) and the permissiveness (ability to support virus replication) of diverse mammalian species to mpox virus. Information from this proposal will define the animal carriers of the virus and will lay a foundation for the molecular surveillance of mpox virus.","1, 2","1b, 2a"

P21175,Investigating the Long-Term Impacts of Pandemic Disease,"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from under-represented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Sharon DeWitte at the University of South Carolina, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the long-term impacts of pandemics on population health and demography by studying how the 1918 â€œSpanishâ€ influenza pandemic influenced the health of influenza survivors and how sex and race mediated these changes. The results of this project will be used to support public health measures that will mitigate the negative impacts of Covid-19. Novel data on gendered and racial health disparities will be generated, increasing knowledge of health inequality in the past, and contributing to current discourse on health disparity and the social determinants of health. Characterizing how pandemic influenza influences mortality among various populations will help inform predictions of how future outbreaks will affect modern society. Results on how demography influenced long-term survival in 1918 will be used to understand how sex and race may affect health and mortality of Covid-19 survivors.<br/><br/>This project has the following research goals: understand how overall population health changed after the pandemic and characterize how sex and social race influenced health and survival. Previous studies on the 1918 flu pandemic have relied primarily on documentary evidence â€"" such as hospital or death records â€"" or on viral RNA extracted from a handful of individuals. Researchers have been unable to explore factors influencing mortality on a population scale from a biological perspective. This project will use an untapped source of data: human skeletal remains of individuals who survived the 1918 pandemic. This proposed project takes a bioarchaeological approach, analyzing the skeletal remains of individuals who died before and after the 1918 pandemic. Skeletal lesions associated with increased morbidity and mortality will be analyzed alongside ages-at-death using hazards analysis to assess if post-pandemic populations lived longer or had less disease compared pre-pandemic populations. Differences in survivorship and lesion prevalence will also be assessed by sex and social race to examine if demographic factors influenced mortality and survival. The findings of this research on how sex and social race influenced long term survival in 1918 can predict how demography will influence health and mortality in Covid-19 survivors in the upcoming years. The information learned from this project will be disseminated through lectures increasing public literacy of the roles sex and social race play in creating health disparity, educating the public about virus transmission, and increasing public awareness of the ongoing danger of epidemics in our highly interconnected society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",3,"3b, 3d"

C21060,"Mathematical modelling to examine disease, control measures, vaccine interactions and resistance to guide public health and disease elimination strategies","Mathematical models are increasingly important to understand new and existing diseases and for planning how we tackle these diseases. Models with enough detail of how a disease interacts with the body, how drugs and other interventions affect the disease, and how health systems respond can help us evaluate the best approaches for addressing diseases.    In this project, we will examine the impact of pathogen resistance to disease interventions. We address two important pathogens: malaria and SARS-Cov-2. As we get closer to eliminating malaria and other diseases, preventing diseases from evolving resistance to response measures becomes ever more critical. Since the characteristics of resistance differ depending on the level of disease, public health strategies are likely to change as we near elimination. In the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we are at a crucial moment to define strategies for deploying vaccines. Since the virus that causes COVID-19 is likely to mutate further, new vaccine-resistant variants may emerge.    We will examine how resistance to vaccines and other treatment measures comes about, and will define intervention roll-out strategies to best avoid resistance for different pathogens. Our work will bring together mathematical models and what we know about how diseases evolve, to come up with the best possible health policies and vaccine roll-out plans over the coming years. We will build and calibrate detailed parasite models, mosquito-to-human transmission models and adapt individual-level models for malaria. We will also adapt models of SARS-CoV-2 to examine the emergence of vaccine-resistant COVID variants.    These new models will help identify key disease characteristics that drive the evolution of resistance and the spread of resistant pathogens. We will examine resistance to vaccines, drugs and immune response therapies; in the case of malaria, we will also examine the spread of mosquitoes resistant to insecticides.    Our work will provide evidence to support the selection of disease control and elimination strategies and inform decision-making, especially surrounding resistance.

The viral subfamily selected to demonstrate the unique benefits of this innovative way to induce highly anti-viral active antibodies is the sarbecovirus subfamily. The equine antibodies will be processed as purified F(ab'Äô)2 fragments, a well-known pharmaceutical product with a strong historical safety record in human patients. The F(ab'Äô)2 antibody fragments generated by e-FabRIC are expected to display a unique and very wide neutralizing activity spectrum. This new property will be the synergistic outcome of the immunization with a nanoparticle co-displaying 8 different sarbecovirus RBD subunits (designated as 'Äúmosaic antigen'Äù) and the natural immunogenetic diversity present in individual horses. In each individual horse, the mosaic antigen immunization will drive the generation and maturation of antibodies highly focused on conserved epitope structures shared by the different sarbecovirus RBD subunits and associated with viral neutralization. As each horse's own immunogenetics will mature the mosaic antigen-specific antibodies in a different way, several equine individual antibody specificities will be pooled in order to expand the overall broad viral neutralizing activity of the final pharmaceutical product. The combined multiplicity of individual antibody response diversities and the highly focused antibody responses induced by the mosaic antigen will be the basis of a broadly potent, immunotherapy pharmaceutical F(ab'Äô)2-based product able to significantly reduce the clinical and societal impact of any emergence of a new human sarbecovirus outbreak. The scientific and technical learnings of this new and powerful immunization strategy will be applicable to other viral families from which human infectious threats may arise.","1, 7","1d, 7a"
P21703,The role of macrophage podosomes in Ebola virus pathogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Ebola virus (EBOV) is an emerging, highly pathogenic virus associated with increasingly more frequent  outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in human populations. Approved countermeasures to prevent or treat EBOV  disease are currently limited. Macrophages are the initial cells targeted by EBOV, and yet, little is known about  the exact nature of EBOV-macrophage surface interactions and subsequent uptake into the cell. Due to their  migratory properties, macrophages are also believed to rapidly disseminate the virus to distant tissues and  organs despite the lack of experimental evidence. We have preliminary data showing that EBOV depends on  podosomes, mechanosensitive adhesive structures used by macrophages to migrate through tissues and  sample antigens, to enter macrophages. The data also shows that EBOV replication increases macrophage  locomotion through a fibrillar 3D matrix and reduces podosome number, suggesting that the virus actively  transforms infiltration of tissues by these cells. This proposal aims to examine the interactions between EBOV  and podosomes. In Aim 1, we will determine whether podosomes serve as ports for EBOV entry into human  macrophages. In Aim 2, we will characterize migratory and invasive properties of macrophages challenged with  EBOV. In Aim 3, we will assess host resistance to systemic infection with EBOV in a mouse model of EBOV  disease devoid of functional macrophages. Our findings will establish a new model of interactions between EBOV  and macrophages, laying the groundwork for further investigations into pathogenesis of filoviruses. Importantly,  these discoveries may lead to new areas of development of novel countermeasures targeting EBOV and related  viruses.",1,1b
P23148,Identification of the pyrethroid resistance mutation on chromosome 1 in Aedes aegypti,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Here we seek to understand the evolution of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Aedes  aegypti, an important vector of human diseases such as dengue and Zika. Pyrethroid insecticides  are widely used for control of adult Aedes, but resistance has evolved in many populations,  representing a global challenge for control of this vector and the diseases it transmits. Finding  strategies for delaying the development of resistance by mosquito vectors to the few available  insecticides is critical. To do so, it is essential to identify the mutations responsible for resistance  in order to design sensitive and precise monitoring programs, to understand the population  genetics and the evolution of resistance, and to design effective countermeasures to slow the  development of resistance.  Our long-term goal is to develop the necessary technologies for monitoring resistance alleles so that  this important evolutionary process can be studied and so that the development of resistance can be  delayed. Our short-term goal is to determine the mutation responsible for the newly identified  pyrethroid resistance locus on chromosome 1 in A. aegypti. To address our short-term goal, we will  pursue two specific aims:  Aim 1. Determining the resistance locus on chromosome 1 with high resolution.  Aim 2. Evaluation of candidate genes at the resistance locus on chromosome 1 and  validation of the mutation causing resistance.  A substantial amount of preliminary data has been obtained in support of this proposal. In addition to  the susceptible ROCK and well characterized SP strains, we have isolated two congenic resistant  strains. The CKR strain contains the resistance factors from the SP strain introgressed into the  background of the ROCK strain, and the KR strain contains only the kdr mutation in the background  of ROCK. We have also conducted a transcriptomic (RNAseq) and proteomic analysis of these  strains which will facilitate our selection of candidate genes at the resistance locus.  These experiments will allow us to identify a new pyrethroid resistance mutation in A. aegypti and  will give us preliminary information about its frequency in other populations of A. aegypti from across  the globe. These data will provide new information about the similarities and differences that  insecticide selection has had on geographically distant populations. Our results will form the basis  for future studies of resistance monitoring and resistance management in this important vector of  human disease.",2,2y

C09561,Rapid olfactory tools for telemedicine-friendly COVID-19 screening and surveillance,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating infectious disease outbreak in a century, particularly inunderserved and minoritized communities. In 2020 alone, it will cost a million lives. It continues to wreakeconomic havoc worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to develop new tools that can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Rapid screening tools can identify potentially infected individuals whocan then be isolated/quarantined from the uninfected and directed towards further testing and treatment.Unfortunately, definitive viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 has proven difficult to implement in many countries,including the US, due to technical, financial and governmental hurdles to universal access and timelyprocessing. Symptom-based screening offers a valuable, albeit imperfect, complement to viral testing that canhelp identify many individuals with the disease for isolation as well as treatment. A major challenge withsymptomatic testing is that COVID-19 is highly protean: the heterogeneity of symptoms means no singlesymptom or constellation of symptoms is definitive diagnostically. Still, there is growing evidence that suddenpartial or complete olfactory loss - even more than other symptoms such as fever or dry cough - is the singlebest predictor of COVID-19. In this proposal, we will develop and implement objective, self-administered smelltests for the purpose of identifying individuals with COVID-19 prior to, or in the absence of, viral testing, as wellas for use in population-level surveillance of COVID-19 spread. Several kinds of objective tests have beenused in clinical or laboratory settings to assess an individual's olfactory ability, including those that test theability to identify or discriminate odors as well as procedures to determine the lowest concentration anindividual can reliably perceive (i.e., odor detection threshold). Each approach has technical and logisticaladvantages and disadvantages, and each captures different aspects of olfactory dysfunction. RegardingCOVID-19, it is unknown what type of measure has the highest specificity or sensitivity. In Aim 1, we will use self-administered objective testing of odor identification and odor detection threshold in SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals to determine which olfactory measure is the best predictor of COVID-19. In Aim 2, we will use objective smell testing to assess whether population monitoring of olfactory loss in university, municipal orother community settings can serve as a sentinel of COVID-19 community spread. Together, our studies willprovide a rapid, remote-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, non-intrusive method to screen for COVID-19 at theindividual level and to assess prevalence in communities, especially those that have been traditionallyunderserved by the health care system and public health infrastructure.","1, 3","1a, 3a"

P21961,"IP21-002, Enhanced Surveillance to Assess Vaccine Preventable Enteric and Respiratory Virus Illnesses","We will conduct active, prospective inpatient, emergency department (ED) and asymptomatic  healthy control (HC) surveillance in children at SCH and affiliated clinics in the Seattle  metropolitan area. We will enroll subjects to describe the population-based burden of AGE and  ARI in King County and Snohomish County, WA and evaluate effectiveness of licensed  vaccines, such as influenza (Flu) and rotavirus (RV) vaccine (vx). We will assess the  epidemiology and natural history of pediatric respiratory and enteric viral diseases and assess  transmission dynamics for vx-preventable (RV, Flu) and potentially vx-preventable pathogens,  such as norovirus (NV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. After obtaining  informed consent and assent, if applicable, in English or Spanish, we will interview families to  collect epidemiological and clinical information, vaccine history, and obtain study specimens  including respiratory and/or stool specimens, depending on clinical symptoms. Vaccination data  are recorded in our state vaccine database, which is very reliable and complete. During times of  COVID-19, novel methods of enrollment and capturing data may be utilized as per IRB-  approved protocols including verbal or online consent, telephone interviews to complete data  capture, and home specimen collection. Respiratory specimens and stool samples will be tested  for multiple respiratory and enteric pathogens using sensitive and specific molecular PCR tests  in laboratories using approved testing strategies that have been validated by proficiency testing.  With this information, in addition to publicly available state-wide data describing inpatient and  acute care visits in WA, we will obtain incidence rates of ED and inpatient visits and  characterization of illness for multiple viral pathogens, including those responsible for vx-  preventable disease and potentially vx-preventable disease, and others related to acute  respiratory and enteric diseases, such as rhinovirus, EVD-68, parainfluenza viruses,  adenoviruses, and human metapneumovirus. Additionally, we will continue ongoing surveillance  for Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) throughout WA state. In collaboration with statewide AFM  expert and SCH neurologist, Dr. Catherine Otten and using WA DOH surveillance data we will  conduct active surveillance, establish incidence rates, and compare rates of AFM to current  circulation of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. We will characterize the clinical  spectrum of AFM by evaluating clinical and laboratory data, MRI findings, therapeutic  interventions, and outcomes to inform early diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment.",3,"3a, 3d"
P21554,"Development of Host- Oriented Therapeutics Targeting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),","The ultimate goal of this Phase I application is to discover and develop host-oriented small molecule compounds  targeting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel  coronavirus driving the current global pandemic of severe respiratory syndrome in humans. Antiviral therapeutics  are urgently needed to combat infection by SARS-CoV-2 and new variants that are continuing to emerge. We  have discovered several chemical series that target modular interactions between specific host proteins  containing WW-domains (e.g. Nedd4) and viral proteins containing PPxY motifs (e.g. Ebola VP40). Notably,  emerging RNA virus pathogens such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and rabies viruses all encode PPxY motifs that  recruit host WW-domain containing proteins to facilitate efficient virus egress, spread, and transmission.  Interestingly, the surface-exposed Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 also has a putative WW-domain  binding motif (25PPAY28), that is not present in the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 or more attenuated coronavirus  strains. The acquisition of this PPAY motif in the major surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 virions raises the  intriguing possibility that it may contribute to the unique pathogenicity and/or transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via  interactions with specific host WW-domain bearing proteins. In our ongoing studies on filoviruses and  arenaviruses, we have used extensive SAR to identify a lead compound series capable of blocking egress and  spread of live EBOV, MARV, and LAFV in cell culture, as well as blocking disease progression in vivo in a live  MARV challenge model. Here, we hypothesize that Ã¢Â€ÂœinformedÃ¢Â€Â SAR analyses of our in-hand PPxY/WW-domain  inhibitors (e.g. lead candidate FC-10696) will lead to the discovery of analogs capable of blocking egress and  disease progression of SARS-CoV-2, as well as related PPxY-containing variants that may emerge in the future.  In support of our hypothesis, we present strong preliminary data showing that the PPxY motif within the S protein  of SARS-CoV-2 virus can interact with host WW-domain containing proteins that are known to promote egress  and spread of EBOV, MARV, and LAFV. Moreover, our current lead candidate PPxY budding inhibitors show  activity in blocking egress of live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in human lung epithelial cells. In this Phase I  proposal, we will identify and evaluate host-oriented inhibitors as potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 and  related coronaviruses by combining the pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry expertise of the scientists at  the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. (FCCDC) with the expertise and experience of the Harty Lab at  the University of Pennsylvania in the experimental aspects of virus-host interactions and antiviral therapy, and  the lab of Olena Shtanko at Texas Biomedical Research Institute for evaluating compounds against live viruses  under BSL-3 conditions. The three aims are (1) lead finding and optimization medicinal chemistry including  ADME profiling, (2) evaluation for the ability to specifically inhibit egress of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs and PPxY-  mediated S-host protein interactions, and (3) in vitro and in vivo analyses against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus.",6,6a
P23383,"Surveillance, control and prevention of neglected zoonotic diseases in Uganda","Despite substantial human, social and economic cost, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and brucellosis have been long neglected and, as a result, we lack good understanding about the natural history of these diseases and the strategies for mitigation and control. Another gap in knowledge is how these infections are understood by the affected communities, which practices and behaviours make them zoonotic (transmissible to humans), and what the best one-health approaches are to limit the risk of spillover events to humans.     The overall objective of this project is to improve understanding and control of these diseases at the human-animal-wildlife interface in the cattle corridor of Uganda. This project will investigate the disease burden in humans, animals and wildlife and will characterize the disease dynamics and drivers across geography, habitat, population density and economic activity. It will also investigate how gender and population-level inequalities shape local transmission dynamics for these diseases. Finally, it will develop a one-health approach (integrating people, animals and ecosystems) to enhance surveillance and reporting systems for these diseases and other zoonoses of global significance.     A series of mixed-methods research studies will be conducted in diverse agricultural systems which interface with conservation areas within the Uganda cattle corridor. The project will specifically target sites with a history of the three targeted zoonotic outbreaks, providing an opportunity to study transmission dynamics and networks of these diseases in the multi-ethnic communities in relation to gender, animal markets and diverse agricultural systems. It will provide an understanding based on farming practices, land use, interface of humans and animals in wildlife and forest environments, gender inequalities and other socio-economic factors. One-health models incorporating well-evidenced interventions to mitigate these diseases and their drivers will be developed to strengthen preparedness and responses.","2, 3","2a, 3a, 3d"
C03163,Alcohol consumption and the COVID-19 pandemic: synthesizing knowledge for policy action,"Health researchers are warning that alcohol use and alcohol dependence in many jurisdictions may be increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, scientific evidence is sparse on the impact of the pandemic on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms (e.g., violence against women and children). Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on short-term and long-term alcohol use and related health harms is urgently needed to inform policy and practice.  The proposed project will result in the rapid (within one month of project commencement) production of evidence-informed guidelines for alcohol control policy recommendations. Guidelines will be updated monthly as more information is synthesized by the research team. The guidelines will be based on the following three unique research projects:  1. A systematic scoping review which will a) assess the current state of knowledge regarding how similar crises (e.g., economic crises and natural disasters) affect alcohol consumption and resulting health harms, and b) assess the applicability and/or transferability of these data to the current pandemic context.  2. An analysis of existing data sources, including general population survey data and alcohol sales data, to examine changes in alcohol consumption in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  3. Individual and group interviews with a diverse set of experts to synthesize knowledge from multiple disciplines and to reach consensus on a) the expected short- and long-term impact of the current pandemic on alcohol consumption and related health harms, and b) policy actions required to minimize the negative health effects from increased alcohol consumption during the current pandemic and future crises.  The results will inform and assist policy makers in determining which alcohol policies should be implemented during the current pandemic and future crises to mitigate alcohol-related harms.","9, 10","9e, 10a"
C15325,Identifying and inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 packaging mechanism,"Project Summary  We aim to determine the molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 viral packaging and to develop a screening strategy  to identify inhibitors of this key step in the coronavirus infection cycle. Selective packaging of the viral genome,  over more abundant transcripts, involves specific interactions between an RNA packaging signal, viral structural  proteins and possibly other factors. Inhibition of this process would block formation of infectious virions and  thereby contribute to a therapeutic regimen that would prevent or treat infection. Building on our laboratory's  extensive expertise in RNA biochemistry and virus-like particle research, we propose to determine the functional  SARS-CoV-2 packaging signal and to develop a robust small molecule-based assay for SARS-CoV-2 packaging  inhibition.  To determine the components of the SARS-CoV-2 packaging mechanism, we will generate virus-like particles  (VLPs) that contain the structural proteins of the virus but not the viral genome. The absence of the genome  renders these VLPs non-infectious and therefore safe to work with. Methods for generating these VLPs derive  from published research with other coronaviruses as well as our own lab's experience working with influenza  and HIV VLPs. SARS-CoV-2 VLPs will be produced by co-expressing the viral spike (S), envelope (E),  membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. RNA molecules containing the packaging signal can be packaged  into these VLPs and delivered into receiver cells, providing an assay for packaging signal detection. In parallel,  this approach will be used to establish a screening assay to identify viral packaging inhibitors. These two aims  are independent, yet the results of each workstream will inform both the fundamental and applied aspects of the  project.  Our long-term objective is to develop a small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 viral packaging. This approach  has the following advantages: 1) we will naturally detect nucleocapsid inhibitors, which can be potent antiviral  drugs as shown for HIV and other viruses due to strict constraints on nucleocapsid function; 2) our approach  targets a step in the viral infection cycle that is not currently the focus of major therapeutic discovery efforts,  enhancing the opportunity to find a new and/or complementary antiviral strategy; and 3) our screening approach  does not require live virus and can be executed safely in most high-throughput screening facilities.  The research proposed here will enable the development of new antiviral strategies for treating coronaviruses.  SARS-CoV-2 is the third betacoronavirus to trigger a zoonotic outbreak in the last 18 years and estimates  suggest that ~5000 related viruses are circulating within bat populations around the world. Our proposal targets  a critical yet relatively understudied step of the coronavirus life cycle that is a promising target of selective small-  molecule inhibition. The results of this work will inform and enable other viral inhibition efforts and provide a basis  for future high-throughput drug discovery initiatives.",6,6a

C20719,Retaining and Attracting Workers in Long-Term Care Homes: How System Dynamics Can Help,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the dire need to address underlying long-term care (LTC) workforce and workplace issues that affect resident quality of care and quality of life. These issues include insufficient funding, under-staffing, poor working conditions, complacency towards overburdened and undervalued staff, and lack of regulatory enforcement. These issues also contribute to poor job satisfaction among workers. In recent years, there have been policy changes to improve workforce and workplace conditions. But, some of these 'fixes' were later shown to be ineffective or even made the problem worse. These 'fixes that fail' are not an uncommon occurrence in complex systems like healthcare. The interconnectedness of factors, the nonlinearity of relationships (can't draw a straight line between two variables), the feedback processes created in response to policy changes, and delayed reactions all make for a complex system that common quantitative tools used in policy design and evaluation, such as spreadsheet models and regression analysis, have difficulty handling. The proposed research uses novel engineering approaches, including group model building, to create a dynamic model of LTC job satisfaction. Our proposed model relies on quantitative and qualitative data available only from LTC homes. We also rely on the expertise of personal support workers to help specify causal relationships between variables. We will test how well the model replicates historical data from a LTC home. We will then use the model to test 'what if' policy scenarios. Policy makers can graphically see how outcomes, like job satisfaction, might respond over time to hypothetical policies. They can also trace the causal pathway between policy and outcome to better understand which variables have most impact. While real world interventions are needed, the proposed research can be a first step to designing and improving the LTC system. ",10,10c

C02357,Communicating through COVID-19 and beyond: a multi-language study of speech perception in adverse listening conditions,"COVID-19 has reshaped speech communication dramatically. Face-to-face communication now often includes one or both parties sporting a (face) mask: the listener's comprehension effort now involves mask-imposed distortions to the acoustic speech signal and a deprivation of visual cues. Online teleconferencing presents unique challenges: people often communicate from non-ideal physical spaces (echoes, background noise) and/or network set-ups (transmission delays). An increase in international collaboration means many people are not communicating in their native language. Using a multi-language study of speech perception in adverse listening conditions, we will investigate language-specific variation in adaptation performance to mask-distorted speech, speech embedded in noise, and comprehension in a second language. By better understanding the way individuals are adapting to the challenging listening experience, we will be able to inform communication guidance for a broad range of stakeholders to ensure information can be passed on efficiently and effectively, especially in remote settings, during COVID-19 and beyond.",10,10d

C03925,A high-throughput nanoparticle assay to characterize cancer neoepitope-specific T cells,"PROJECT SUMMARYAs of early May 2020, there have been approximately 3.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 infectionworldwide, and approximately 260,000 deaths.1 A retrospective cohort study of patients from Wuhan, Chinademonstrated that although both survivors and non-survivors initially follow similar clinical courses, developingsepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at similar time points, non-survivors progress on tomulti-organ failure (MOF), secondary infection, and death.2 Additionally, pediatric cases have been shown tohave a much milder disease course than adults, and the reasons for this are not clear.3These differences inclinical courses could in part be explained by the patients' pre-existing T cell repertoire, phenotype, and HLA-specificity, which may influence downstream T cell phenotype and cytokine responses. Using in silicoapproaches, we identified multiple potential T cell epitopes which can be divided into 3 broad categories: 1)Epitopes with homology to the original SARS virus 2) Epitopes with homology to other viruses/bacteria 3)Epitopes with homology to self-antigens. We have developed aAPC constructs to interrogate both HLA class Iand HLA class II CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, respectively. As such, we will be able to obtain a broadunderstanding of the role these 3 different types of virus-specific epitopes play in the development of COVID-19 specific responses. A better understanding of how T cells contribute to progression of disease severity isespecially pertinent to patients who are on long-term immunosuppressive therapies because of malignancies,bone marrow transplant, or organ transplant. Patients with cancer were found to have higher probabilities ofhaving more severe disease and worse outcomes in China than both patients without cancer and cancersurvivors.4This proposal builds upon previously published work to screen patients for virus-specific T cellsusing only 100 L of whole blood, and with a turn-around time of less than 24 hours.5 In addition, we have alsodeveloped an enrichment and expansion (E+E) technology to rapidly expand virus and tumor-specific T cellswithin a 7 day time frame.6-12Combining these two approaches, we will identify clinically important T cellepitopes and demonstrate that functional T cells can be expanded to large numbers over a brief period-of-timein otherwise healthy donors and patients with cancer.","1, 3","1d, 3b"
C07229,Role of Alcohol Disparities in HIV Risk among Sexual Minority Youth,"PROJECT Summary: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had widespread social, psychological, and economic repercussions in the United States, along with devastating morbidity and mortality. However, these effects have not impacted all populations equally. Surveillance data show that racial/ethnic minorities, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations, have been disproportionately burdened by both the disease and its financial and social consequences. Similarly, sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups, while not captured innational surveillance data, experience high levels of vulnerability, suggesting that they too may be experiencing higher rates of infection and related ramifications of COVID-19. Crucially, as the pandemic has continued todevelop in the US, a greater number of cases have been identified among youth and young adults (YYA) aged 14-24 years, a population previously thought to be at low risk. Given the high mobility and lower perceived riskof this population, this may result in larger outbreaks not only within YYA, but also overall and in additional vulnerable groups.     Therefore, understanding and increasing testing and preventive behaviors among YYA, especially vulnerable SGM YYA (SGMY) and racial/ethnic minority YYA (REMY), is necessary to stop further COVID-19 spread. Unfortunately, COVID-19 impacts, testing, and preventive behaviors in this population have remained markedly understudied. Critically, disparities in testing and preventive behaviors are highly influenced by outside factors. For example, experiences of stigma, at the individual, interpersonal, and structural level, may impact care engagement and prevention among marginalized populations. Furthermore, policy-level factors, including availability of tests, healthcare, governmental messaging, and re-opening patterns, are also likely to influence rates of testing and rates of infection.     As such, given the dearth of information surrounding COVID-19 among SGMY and REMY, and the rising rates of infection in these groups, this project will use a geographically diverse quantitative survey to assess patterns and disparities in COVID-19 testing and preventive behaviors longitudinally across 6 months, as well as the impact of multilevel factors,including stigma and policy. Informed by the results of this survey, and guided by the Information, Motivation,and Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model, we will use a mixed-methods approach to iteratively develop a community engaged, health messaging intervention tailored towards SGMY and REMY to increase testing and preventive behaviors, provisionally titled Prev_Cvd. This text messaging intervention will be pilot testied by 100 REMYand SGMY to refine content and determine feasibility and acceptability. Given the lack of messaging guidelines for this population, this will be the first evidence-based messaging intervention for COVID-19 prevention among YYA. Developing and pilot testing such an intervention with active input from the community will allow for the intervention, if effective, to be rapidly scaled up and widely implemented to address disparities in COVID-19 among YYA and reduce overall transmission.","9, 10","9b, 9c, 10a"
P21544,Dissecting the mechanisms of intestinal epithelial injury by Ebola virus using iPSC-derived intestinal organoids,"Project Summary  Filoviruses, including ebola- and marburgviruses, are prime examples of zoonotic viruses that cause severe  disease in humans. The most pathogenic ebolavirus species is Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus; EBOV) with case  fatality rates ranging from 40 to 90%. Many patients who succumb to the disease are admitted to Ebola treatment  units when they are already severely ill. Importantly, there are no therapeutics available to mitigate late-stage  Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). While many aspects of EBOV pathogenesis have been extensively studied in cell  culture systems and animal models, the involvement of the intestine in EVD is not at all understood, despite  diarrhea being among the most frequent symptoms (78% of patients in some case studies) and being one of the  main causes for demise. Gastrointestinal manifestations, including vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, are  also common symptoms of Marburg virus (MARV) disease. There are currently no infection models available  that allow to study the consequences of filovirus infection of the gut. To fill this gap, we propose to establish  human intestinal infection platforms to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying filovirus-induced damage  of the intestinal organs. We will explore two potential mechanisms that might play a role in the pathophysiological  effects induced by filovirus infection: i) Filovirus infection of the human intestinal epithelium leads to loss of barrier  integrity. ii) Filovirus infection of the human intestinal epithelium modulates the function of ion transporters.  Identifying mechanisms that contribute to the induction of severe diarrhea in filovirus infection has the potential  to inform urgently needed therapeutic approaches to mitigate the severe intestinal symptoms in late-stage  filovirus disease.  Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of indefinite self-renewal and have the potential to  differentiate into any tissue-specific cell lineage, including human intestinal organoids (HIOs). In preparation for  this project, we have successfully achieved robust EBOV and MARV infections of iPSC-derived HIOs. The  infected cells showed signs of cell damage, and transcriptomics analysis indicated the modulation of cell junction  pathways and a set of ion transporters known to play a role in the induction of diarrhea. To begin to explore the  intrinsic host response of intestinal cells to filovirus infection and the impact of infection-induced cellular damage  on barrier integrity, we have designed the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: To study the pathophysiological effects of EBOV and MARV infection on intestinal  epithelial integrity.  Specific Aim 2: To validate the role of individual genes by genetic ablation and test potential drug  candidates as modulators of intestinal epithelial function.",1,"1b, 1c"
P22023,Molecular mechanisms linking viral replication and neuropathogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Viruses that infect the developing brain, including Zika virus (ZIKV), cytomegalovirus, and rubella virus cause  major birth defects. Microcephaly is one such birth defect, in which head and brain size are severely reduced,  and is often accompanied by intellectual disability. This virally-inflicted neurological disease, or viral  neuropathogenesis, can be caused by multiple mechanisms. One recently identified way ZIKV non-structural  protein 4A (NS4A) causes microcephaly is by disrupting the human ANKLE2 protein. Interestingly, individuals  with mutations in the gene encoding ANKLE2 suffer from microcephaly. ANKLE2 is conserved from worms to  humans, and is essential for coordinating cell division during brain development. ANKLE2 derives this function  in cell division and development by mediating protein interactions. NS4A physically interacts with ANKLE2 and  disrupts brain development in an ANKLE2-dependent manner in a fruit fly model of brain development. ANKLE2  also promotes ZIKV replication. Taken together, these studies show that in the process of coopting a host protein  for replication, ZIKV dysregulates an important developmental pathway. Thus, the NS4A-ANKLE2 protein  interaction represents an important model to study viral neuropathogenesis and how it is connected to viral  replication and hereditary disorders at the molecular level.  The long-term goal of this work is to decipher how virus-host protein interactions impact virus replication and  pathogenesis, as these discoveries will fuel therapeutic target identification and drug development. The  objective of this proposal is to dissect the mechanisms by which the protein interaction between ZIKV NS4A  and human ANKLE2 promote ZIKV replication and inhibit brain development. To accomplish this objective, we  will test the central hypothesis that ANKLE2 promotes viral replication through its interaction with NS4A and  by recruiting other host factors involved in ZIKV replication to sites of replication, and this disrupts physiological  ANKLE2 protein interactions required for brain development. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis:  Aim 1: Dissect the impact of the NS4A-ANKLE2 protein interaction in ZIKV replication and pathogenesis.  Aim 2: Unravel the molecular function of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication and pathogenesis.  When completed, this work will delineate how a single virus-host protein interaction rewires a developmental  pathway to facilitate virus replication and inflict neurological disease at the molecular level. This will reveal  detailed biochemical insight into a virus-host protein interaction with amino acid-level resolution, new host factors  that play a role in ZIKV replication, and previously unknown proteins key to brain development and disrupted in  other hereditary developmental disorders. In the long term, the methods established here could be employed to  uncover the molecular mechanisms behind other diseases with viral and hereditary etiologies.","1, 4","1b, 1c, 4b"
C15182,Wirelessly controlled BSL3 vivarium system for automated microdosing in studies of infectious diseases,"Project Summary  Infectious diseases are caused by micro-organisms, such as bacteria, protozoa, viruses or fungi, which can be  transferred through direct or indirect human contact. A viral infection occurs when a host's body is invaded by  pathogenic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that  causes COVID-19 and the current pandemic. This pandemic is the greatest public health challenge since the  1918 influenza pandemic and the biggest threat to destabilizing the global economy since World War II.  As viruses tend to mutate quicker than other pathogenic agents (and thus newer strains emerge time and again),  continuous research is required to combat infectious agents. For preclinical research, the most frequently used  animal models are mice and rats. They offer an optimal combination of genetic proximity to humans, cost for  breeding and colony maintenance possibilities due to their small size. Mice offer the broadest spectrum of  available models. Rats are the second most frequently used mammal animal model. In fact, several SARS-CoV-  2 researchers are turning to rats. They are no more susceptible to COVID-19 than mice, but their larger size is  an advantage, as, for example, researchers often want to do repetitive bleeding in an experiment but cannot do  that with mice. Furthermore, as vaccine studies often assess how different doses affect antibody responses over  several days, most toxicology studies of drugs also start in rat.  To achieve intermittent infusions in most non-infectious disease research, the current prevailing administration  modes for small animal research are manual (oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous) requiring  repeated handling by trained technicians. However, infectious disease researchers desire the least number of  touchpoints possible with their infected animals, especially when sharp needles are involved  The proposed FluidSync BSL3 system may aid the discovery of new treatments for COVID-19 by enabling  candidate drugs to be administered to model animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 while minimizing  investigator contact. It may also be used in the development of vaccines and antibodies. The system builds on  the first and only wireless and tether-free administration system that can be used in animals as small as mice.  The new system will have new capabilities including i) a medical-grade primary battery and ii) a programmable  system-on-chip including Bluetooth telemetry transceiver, processor and memory.  Ultimately, the FluidSync BSL3 microinfusion system would enable an intelligent instrumented vivarium system  that addresses many BSL3 user requirements with benefits including increased productivity, reduced researcher  exposure to potentially toxic drugs and disease vectors, ease of management of large-scale animal studies, and  minimized animal handling to reduce white coat effects.",1,1e
C02989,Canadian Treatments for COVID-19: SOLIDARITY [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"This proposal is for an adaptive, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial for the treatment of COVID19, in collaboration with countries around the world, working in solidarity with the World Health Organization. We are currently active in 22 centres across the country, have randomized 70 patients at time of writing across multiple provinces, and are funded for 440 participants through the first rapid response fund from CIHR for coronavirus. This proposal is to expand to 80 sites across the country and enrol thousands of patients, over the course of this and subsequent waves of the COVID19 pandemic over the next 1-2 years. Eligible and consenting hospitalized patients with COVID19 are being randomized to receive either standard-of-care or the study medication plus standard of care. Current approved study arms include: 1. Lopinavir/ritonavir 400mg/100mg PO BID for 14 day plus optimized supportive care, OR 2. Hydroxychloroquine 800mg BID for 1 day then 400mg BID for 10 days plus optimized supportive care, OR 3.  Remdesivir 200mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV daily infusion for 9 days plus optimized supportive care, OR 4.  Optimized support care. Inclusion criteria will be: Age = 18 years of age, has laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is admitted to hospital at a participating centre. The primary outcome will be mortality at hospital discharge. CATCO is incorporated into the WHO Solidarity Global Trial, with interim results from many countries being reviewed by an independent Global Data Monitoring and Safety Committee. This Committee will decide how often to conduct interim analyses and when to declare effectiveness, futility, or harm. It is anticipated that many thousand patients will be recruited into this trial, with over 2000 globally at time of writing. The larger the numbers entered, the more accurate the results will be, both for all patients and for targeted subgroups; the numbers that can be entered will depend critically on how large the pandemic becomes.

C01101,Facilitating the public response to COVID-19 by harnessing group processes,"There is international recognition that effective response to Covid-19 is dependent upon the public acting collectively and for the common good. This is important in terms of adherence to preventative measures, which, especially for low-risk groups, is as much about protecting others as protecting oneself. It is important in terms of volunteering and mutual aid, which is critical in complementing the official response by supporting and sustaining people through the pandemic. It is also important in terms of maintaining social cohesion and avoiding social disorder.  This multi-method project builds upon understandings of psychological group processes to address how to develop and sustain shared identity and social solidarity during pandemics. It is organised around three interrelated strands that together address the issues of adherence, mutual aid and social order.  The first strand uses experiments to examine the impact of collective identification on adherence, the role of leadership in developing collective identification, and how coverage of others' positive or negative behaviours (e.g., volunteering vs. stockpiling) impacts collective identity and adherence to preventative measures.  The second strand uses interview and survey methods to understand why people join emergent mutual aid groups, the effects of participation upon efficacy and well-being, and how such groups can be sustained over time.  The third strand uses ethnographic interviews to examine the UK's security and civil contingency response to the pandemic and enforcement data to understand how responder actions impact upon community relations, adherence and social tensions.",9,"9a, 9b, 9c"
C09524,Effect of Covid-19 engagement of ACE2 on brain health and pathology,"AbstractThere are mechanisms in the brain that regulate interactions between neurons and microglialcells and promote homeostasis. These are perturbed in several diseases includingneuropsychiatric lupus, NPSLE, studied in this PPG, and following sepsis. Many conditions ofneuroinflammation are characterized by microglial activation, and, as a consequence of thisactivation, by neuronal dendritic pruning and an impaired blood brain barrier. Interestingly, apathway regulating homeostasis in the brain and dysregulated by neuroinflammation is therenin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II is generated by angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE,and binds to a receptor AT-1 to enhance inflammation. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptorblockers, ARBs, can improve neuroinflammation by either decreasing production or neutralizingangiotensin II. In this pathway, ACE2, a membrane-bound protease, also functions to destroyangiotensin and to generate a small angiotensin peptide, ang1-7, that is anti-inflammatory.ACE2 is the cellular receptor for Covid-19, and binds the viral spike protein, S, more specifically,the receptor binding domain, RBD. This study will examine the binding of S and RBD to normalmouse brain and to mouse brain mimicking NPSLE or sepsis survival. We will further studywhether engagement by S or RBD alters the functional state of neurons, microglia and brainendothelial cells. Finally, we ask whether the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs alters S or RBDbinding, and whether S or RBD impair the efficacy of these medications in halting or reversingthe neurodegenerative process in NPSLE and in sepsis survivors. This study cannot beperformed in humans, but it has important translational implications.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

C15187,Immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in HIV infected men and women,"ABSTRACT  The CDC recommends that persons living with HIV (PWH) be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However,  there are minimal scientific data to support this important public health principle in relation to ongoing  immune dysfunction and chronic comorbidities and the persistent HIV reservoir in antiretroviral treated (ART)  PWH. We propose that a formal, comprehensive, longitudinal study in a well-characterized cohort of male  and female PWH compared to HIV uninfected controls (HUC) is essential to assess the immunogenicity  of COVID-19 vaccines in PWH. The MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) is ideal for analyzing  the interactive impact of chronic HIV infection on COVID-19 Pfizer and Moderna RNA-based vaccine  immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the HIV reservoir. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct an in-  depth analysis of antibody neutralizing function and B lymphocyte responses in 100 male PWH and 100  female vaccinated PWH, and 25 male and 25 female vaccinated HUC, from the MWCCS. In Aim 2, we will  extensively characterize immune cell phenotypes, soluble markers, and functional cellular immune  responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the participants from Aim 1 before and after vaccination. In Aim 3,  we will evaluate the effects of COVID-19 vaccine on the persistent HIV reservoir (amount and composition,  immune parameters) before and after immunization. Aim 4 applies machine learning approaches on the  entire set of features quantified in Aims 1-3 to predict COVID-19 vaccine response outcomes and  determine the critical parameters that influence vaccine responses. We believe that this study is unique,  important, and critically timely for assessing the scientifically unprecedented, vaccine prevention  phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of HIV infection.",7,7l

P25526,Assessing functional impacts of disease-associated mutations in G-protein 'Äúother'Äù,"G-proteins are GTPases that hydrolyze GTP, conduct intracellular signals across various cells, and maintain homeostasis upon activation. Regulators of G-proteins are divided into guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which promote G-protein activation by substituting GDP for GTP, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) which accelerate GTP hydrolysis and signal termination. G-protein 'Äúother'Äù (Go), encoded in humans by the GNAO1 gene, is the most abundant membrane protein in mammalian brains, regulating neuronal signalling processes and aiding in membrane protein localization. The the Ras-like domain of the Go alpha subunit (G?o) is involved in signalling inactivation via GTP hydrolysis. Early GNAO1 activation is necessary for early development in mammals. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur through random nucleotide substitutions during DNA replication and are a key genetic differentiator among individuals. Missense mutations within protein-coding regions may alter protein interactions & function. Numerous SNPs in GNAO1 have been linked to cancers, developmental delays, movement disorders, and epileptic episodes mainly in children, with some variance between sexes. Disease-associated mutations often occur in the Ras-like domain of G?o. The functional consequences of disease phenotypes can be directly studied by fluorescent assays of nucleotide exchange & GTP hydrolysis using reconstituted G?o mutants of interest, alone or in complex with associated G-protein beta & gamma subunits or GAPs & GEFs. With select mutants, biophysical experiments such as protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-molecule fluorescence can provide additional structural & conformational details while simultaneously viewing active & inactive G?o conformers.",4,4b

Quebec and Ontario have each developed an adult prioritization protocol for access to intensive care in an extreme pandemic context which aims to allocate resources to reduce mortality in a fair and equitable manner. Fortunately, none of these protocols has ever been applied. Consequently, we do not have data on the impacts that their application would have had. We don't know what the public thinks about it either. These protocols have not been subject to a formal public consultation process. What do the people targeted by the protocol say? This project aims to carry out: 1) a mathematical modelling/simulation of two prioritization strategies (application of the adult protocol and principle of first come, first served) for comparative purposes; 2) democratic deliberations with members of the public based on the results of the modeling of the two prioritization strategies and the values that underpin them. Simulating different prioritization strategies will generate objective data on their health impacts (number of lives saved). Submitting the content of the protocols to deliberation will allow for informed feedback from the public in order to bring out the most optimal model.]","4, 11","4c, 11a"
P22232,Irving Estevez_Diversity Supplement: R01 NS120895,"Abstract   Astrocytes are versatile glial cells that regulate diverse processes in the central nervous system (CNS).  Roles for astrocytes during disease are complex and include both protective and pathologic functions. Recently,  distinct astrocyte activation states have been described, though the molecular mechanisms that govern astrocyte  polarization during neurotropic viral infection are not well understood. Here, we propose that receptor-interacting  protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) is a previously unappreciated driver of inflammatory astrocyte activation during viral  infection of the CNS. While roles for RIPK3 in programmed cell death have been extensively characterized, our  published work has described pleiotropic, cell death-independent functions for this pathway in the coordination  of protective neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis. In preliminary studies, we now show that RIPK3  signaling in astrocytes is required for survival and virologic control following challenge with Zika virus, an  emerging neurotropic pathogen of global concern. Using a combination of novel mouse genetic tools, we will  elucidate roles for RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes by 1) Defining profiles of expression, activation, and antiviral  function for astrocytic RIPK3; 2) Determining roles for astrocytic RIPK3 signaling in coordinating  neuroinflammation; and 3) Defining key substrates and transcriptional outputs of RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes.  Together, our studies promise to identify new molecular mechanisms governing protective neuroimmune function  during viral encephalitis.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

P22090,Understanding the antiviral roles of acellular RNA quality control pathway,"Abstract  Eukaryotic cells use multi-layered strategies to ensure the fidelity of gene expression. One of the best-studied  RNA quality control pathways is Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a ribosome-associated surveillance  machinery that recognizes and degrades cellular transcripts with premature termination codons (PTC). Initially  identified as a mechanism to rid the cell of faulty mRNAs, it is now known that NMD also regulates the expression  of 5-10% of cellular transcripts with important functions in cell differentiation, homeostasis, cellular stress  responses, and more. In addition, recent studies have shown that many proteins of the NMD pathway function  in the cell-autonomous defense against RNA viruses, including human-pathogenic alphaviruses, coronaviruses  and flaviviruses. As obligate intracellular parasites, these viruses interface closely with cellular mRNA processing  pathways, and we can gain new insight to NMD functions by understanding how the machinery is repurposed to  fight viral infection. We currently have a very incomplete picture of NMD functions during viral infection. Many  viruses lack PTCs or other NMD-inducing features, and it is not known whether NMD proteins recognize viral  RNA in manners similar to canonical NMD, or through new and unusual interactions or mechanisms. Moreover,  NMD is often globally downregulated during virus infection, suggesting that viruses have mechanisms to rewire  the antiviral NMD network. Using the flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) as a model RNA virus, we aim to understand  the molecular interactions between the NMD machinery and viral infection. We will dissect the NMD-ZIKV  protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction network with a multi-disciplinary approach that combines virology  with RNA biochemistry and high-throughput assays to link molecular interactions to cellular phenotypes. Specific  questions addressed within this study are: 1) How do NMD proteins interact to fight viral infection? 2) Are there  specific features in the viral RNA that trigger NMD, and if so, how are they recognized by the NMD machinery?  3) How do viral proteins inhibit NMD? And 4) Are antiviral NMD functions conserved in the important mosquito  host of flaviviruses? Collectively, our study will provide new insight into an important cell-autonomous antiviral  defense network. In addition, by studying the unusual ways in which NMD is regulated during virus infection, we  hope to discover new cellular functions of the NMD machinery itself.",1,"1b, 1c"
C09970,Grading Gowns: Redesigning One-size PPE To Fit And Protect Female Health Workers More Effectively,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a shortage of suitable PPE has resulted in healthcare workers(HCWs) wearing one-size, disposable isolation gowns, compromising comfort and safety. Oversized, ill-fitting gowns impede movement and increase body temperature and risk of viral transmission. Clinical procurement and acute care leads have expressed the need for more sustainable, reusable, individually sized PPE gowns fabricated from washable textiles to enhance the HCWs experiences, while mitigating infection risk and reducing clinical waste.  The project will deliver a 'reusable PPE isolation gown system' including a doffing accessory to safely remove contaminated gowns. The healthcare sector ready set of gowns will be designed and produced in EN-certificated textiles and manufacturing conditions in multiple sizes (XS-XXXL) informed by: a systematic    review of current PPE design, provision and use; qualitative data from interviews, questionnaires and wearer trials.

C01171,Carrying the work burden of the Covid-19 pandemic: working class women in the UK,"Working class women are carrying the burden of the extra physical and emotional labour being generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These women care for children, sick and frail elderly, clean buildings, cook and serve food, administer institutions and staff shops, while retaining major responsibility for domestic work and caring at home. The Women's Budget Group (WBG) highlighted that 2.5 million of the 3.2 million workers employed in the highest risk roles during the pandemic are women, many in low-paid roles. There is little detailed attention to their experiences and needs and how to urgently support them in their essential work.  The pandemic has created job loss, work instability, financial hardship and great insecurity. Working class women are heavily impacted (WBG 2020; Fawcett Society 2020). There has been time squeeze and work intensification for some, a desperate search for new jobs for others, alongside more unpaid care with school and nursery closures. What is not yet known is how working class women are responding in real time to the various, and as yet potentially unknown, pressures imposed by the virus. If they are unable to manage the existing and additional pressures placed upon them, workplaces, child and elder care will all be severely affected.     The project is in collaboration with the WBG, the leading independent organisation that deals with the impact of policy on women's lives.  We will analyse data from the ESRC's flagship 'UK Household Longitudinal Study', including vital new information being gathered on the impact of COVID-19.

C07114,GAPcare II: The Geriatric Acute & Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention in the Emergency Department,"PROJECT SUMMARY Before the COVID-19 pandemic, only 4% of older adults used telehealth, but uptake has been rapid since the start of social distancing. However, little is known about physicians' experiences implementing telehealth or the extent of uptake among US physicians. There is a critical need to disseminate useful telehealth strategies that physicians have employed to treat older adults, especially those with disabilities (e.g. visual, hearing,mobility, cognitive), living in facilities, with limited digital know-how or access to technology.     Through in-depth interviews with geriatricians, primary care, and emergency physicians, who are the first point of contact during COVID-19, and a subsequent national survey, we propose revealing these strategies, understanding the scope of telehealth uptake nationally, and disseminating our insights which could inform healthcare delivery transformation for older adults. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that physicians have made important discoveries about telehealth since the start of COVID-19 and disseminating lessons learned will ensure that older adult needs are considered as care is rapidly shifted to the virtual environment. Without attention to equity and leveraging insights of physicians that care for older adults, the ""digital divide"" will cause already existing inequities in medical care to further increase at the expense of older adults. Identifying where telehealth has not yet been implemented can be helpful to focus awareness efforts.     Dr. Goldberg will pursue thefollowing two specific aims:   (1) conduct semi-structured telephone interviews (n=36-54) with geriatricians, primary care and emergency physicians (n=12-18 each), stratified by practice setting (metro/suburban/rural(n=12-18 each)) and type (academic/community (n=18-27 each)) to explore telehealth service sprovided/abandoned, modes of use, facilitators/barriers, practical considerations, and experiences with providing care remotely to older adults. We will solicit physicians on social media platforms (Twitter,Facebook), and via specialty society list serves. Findings will inform item generation, reduction, and question content for the survey;   (2) conduct a web-based national survey of geriatricians, primary care and emergency physicians (n=1,600, 1% of each specialty) using the American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile to estimate the scope of telehealth use, methods of delivery, barriers/challenges to adoption, and lessons learned delivering care to older adults.     This contribution is expected to be significant because the choices physicians make in adapting their clinical practice to the remote environment - what modes to use, how to train and assess patients - are likely to dictate if older adults' needs and challenges are considered as the future of healthcare delivery takes shape. Dr. Goldberg's overarching aims are to ensure older adults receive medical care in the most suitable setting by enhancing the knowledge and training physicians receive in telehealth to meet the unique needs of their patients during and after the pandemic. The completion of these aims will provide Dr.Goldberg with critical pilot data for a telehealth training RCT which will be submitted as a R01 to the NIA.","10, 11","10d, 11a"
C07308,Investigating The Use Of Temporary Accommodation To House Asylum Seekers And Refugees During The COVID-19 Outbreak,"This project will explore the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on asylum seekers and refugees living in the UK. As reported by the Home Affairs Select Committee, asylum seekers are at 'heightened risk' in the context of Covid-19. The project will focus on those individuals placed in temporary accommodations such as hostels and hotels, using Glasgow as a base for the project as the local authority with the most dispersed asylum seekers in the UK (Sturge 2020, 14). Recent moves by private sector firms to relocate asylum seekers into 'safe environments' have been widely criticised, particularly for the difficulties in maintaining physical distancing in new crowded, shared spaces thus increasing the risks of exposure to Covid-19 (BBC News, 2020). Organisations and stakeholders representing asylum seekers have reported the fear and distress that this move has caused for asylum seekers (PAIH 2020a). In addition, this re-housing has also made it difficult for charities to provide support to affected individuals, who are moved often at short notice. The project will examine what the situation is currently on the ground, how the crisis has accentuated the risk for those seeking asylum and develop responses with migrant communities to create a genuinely 'safer environment' for asylum seekers. Adopting digital ethnographic methods (Lupton, 2020) co-designed and co-produced with grassroots migrant organisations, the project will deliver longer term impact through the development of co-produced creative outputs including a documentary and work with outreach groups to influence UK government policies and public debate on asylum.",10,10b
P25318,Shaping care home COVID- testing policy: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of asymptomatic testing compared to standard care in care home staff (VIVALDI-CT),"BACKGROUND: Regular asymptomatic testing of care home staff enables earlier outbreak detection protecting vulnerable residents from COVID-19 infection, but is known to have unintended negative consequences. Currently, there is a lack of evidence concerning: the relative benefits/harms of testing; the best approach to ensure compliance with testing; how to sustain testing over time; the parameters in which ongoing testing is warranted; or the nature of unintended and negative consequences. Interdisciplinary and multi-method research, including a rigorous trial, is urgently required to resolve these questions, inform policy, and direct service delivery.      PROJECT AIM: The project examines the relative benefits and harms of regular COVID testing targeting asymptomatic staff in UK care homes.    METHODS: The project is delivered by an experienced, inter-disciplinary team between November 2022 and April 2024. It capitalises on existing data infrastructure and partnerships with providers.      Work-package 1 'Äì Intervention development: using published literature, stakeholder input, and theory, we will coproduce a sustainable, multi-component testing intervention for staff using Lateral Flow Devices, considering: 1) staff sickness payments; 2) psychological strategies to improve testing compliance; 3) testing frequency.      Work-package 2 - Pragmatic cluster randomised trial: we will evaluate the effectiveness of the testing intervention versus testing policy in place nationally at the time of the trial in 140 control and 140 intervention homes. Primary outcome: number of unplanned hospital admissions in residents.  Key secondary outcomes: mortality, testing uptake, outbreaks, prevalence of COVID-19 among tested staff.    Work-package 3 - Process evaluation of intervention and control: qualitative interviews with staff, families and visitors in 28 homes to establish the acceptability, feasibility and impact of the testing intervention, and refine programme theory detailing how the intervention works, to inform its future roll out if successful. Separately we will assess the impact of testing and COVID-19 outbreaks on social care related quality of life in 3 intervention and 3 control homes using the Adult Social Care Outcomes Tool.     Work-package 4 - Economic analysis: using routine NHS datasets and provider administrative records we will itemise the costs and benefits of the testing intervention versus standard care from a NHS, personal social services and societal perspective.  We will model COVID-19 transmission in residents and staff to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths averted by the testing intervention and estimate its cost effectiveness under different epidemiological scenarios.    Work-package 5 - Stakeholder engagement: We will hold 4 roundtable discussions for key stakeholders to engage them in the study, and co-develop plans for dissemination and implementation.      PUBLIC AND PATIENT ENGAGEMENT: Public advisors will be involved at all stages of the trial.     IMPACT AND DISSEMINATION: Findings will inform testing policy and winter planning and longer-term strategies to prevent respiratory infections in care homes. We will disseminate results using traditional and non-traditional media, an in-person conference, virtual knowledge exchange events and by visiting care homes.",13,
C19774,Predicting the risk of developing mental and substance use disorders due to COVID-19: machine learning applied to health service utilization data to facilitate access to effective treatments.,"COVID-19 has caused unprecedented demand on health care systems worldwide. Early indications suggest that the pandemic will lead to a surge in mental health and substance use disorders. This study aims to examine these mental and substance use implications through comparison of patient cohorts in BC, Canada based on their ""illness dose"" of COVID-19. In partnership with the Health Authorities and the BC Ministry of Health, we will deploy an online survey to assess these patient groups to detect the new onset or worsening of mental and substance use disorders that may be attributed to COVID-19. We will leverage Population Data BC, one of the world's largest collections of health services data containing individual-level, de-identified longitudinal data on BC's 4.7 million residents. We will link our survey results with data available at Population BC data, in order to retrospectively study the sociodemographic, service utilization, prescription drug use, employment, and environmental exposures of patients over the past 10 years. Using machine learning methods (Artificial Intelligence) to compare these different cohorts, each of which represents different ""doses"" of exposure to COVID-19, we will identify patients that are at increased risk of developing COVID-19-related adverse mental health outcomes. We will follow up with COVID-19 positive patients through a virtual clinic and assess existing treatment options for mental and substance use problems. Ultimately, we will have a system to predict increased risk of neuropsychiatric impact of COVID-19 on patients in BC, and to facilitate access of these patients early on to existing mental health services. This important data will allow Health Authorities to prepare for subsequent waves of COVID-19 with the tools required to rapidly mitigate its adverse effects on mental health and substance use.",10,10a
C06727,SBIR Phase II: Protein A Membrane Columns for Rapid Protein Purification,"Project Summary: This SBIR Urgent Competitive Revision will develop the first affinity membrane to purify therapeutic mRNA withhigh selectivity and throughput. mRNA-based pharmaceuticals have potential to address a wide variety ofpathologies. mRNA-based vaccines can increase safety and dramatically shorten development timelines inpandemic scenarios. A number of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are under development, and one suchvaccine has completed its Phase-I clinical trial and showed great promise as a response to the COVID-19pandemic. However, a company pioneering mRNA medicines has revealed that the lack of high throughputdownstream purification processes is a major hurdle that must be addressed in the upscaling of industrialmRNA production to yield the necessary quantity and quality. Considering the profound impact that COVID-19will have on the global population of nearly seven billion people, the time to develop a high productivity mRNApurification technology, like the one proposed, is now. By addressing this challenge, the proposed technologywill have a significant impact on mRNA production and, by association, improve patient accessibility to thevaccine. Therapeutic mRNA usually possesses a polyadenylic acid (poly-A) tail. Oligo-deoxythymidine (oligo-dT) has been recognized as effective affinity ligand to isolate polyadenylated mRNA from feed streams viahybridization between adenine in the poly-A tail and deoxythymidine in oligo-dT. The goal of this CompetitiveRevision project is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing dT-based affinity membrane products with highbinding capacity for the rapid and selective purification of polyadenylated mRNA. Preliminary data are highlyencouraging. The products derived from this innovation will be first-in-market, disposable membranechromatography columns that can improve the mRNA purification productivity up to one hundred times withhigh purity and yield compared to conventional resin columns. The Specific Aims of the study are to (1)synthesize and characterize mRNA affinity membranes and (2) test prototype affinity membrane columns forcapture step purification of polyadenylated mRNA. In Specific Aim 1, Purilogics will evaluate the roles playedby ligand structure and density, synthesis conditions, and bind-and-elute conditions on capacity and recoveryusing a commercially available purified mRNA. In Specific Aim 2, Purilogics will collaborate with a partnercontract manufacturing organization to quantify membrane column performance for capture step purification ofpolyadenylated mRNA prepared with in vitro transcription (IVT) processes. The prototypes also will bebenchmarked against existing products. Multiple iterations of synthesis and performance characterization willimprove membrane performance.

P22338,A Novel Strategy for Generating Safe and Effective Flavivirus Vaccines,"The recent emergence and devastating impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) clearly demonstrates that arboviral  emergence continues to defy accurate prediction and exposes our inability to rapidly respond to and control  outbreaks. The medical and veterinary importance of emerging flaviviruses is significantly exacerbated by the  absence of available vaccines, therapeutics, and reliable control measures. Vaccination remains the most  reliable strategy for outbreak prevention and control, but vaccine development intrinsically involves trade-offs  between safety and immunogenicity. This study will develop a platform to overcome these trade-offs by  combining the safety advantages of non-replicating platforms with the rapid and long-lived immunogenicity of a  live-attenuated vaccine. We have developed a unique chimeric virus platform based on a novel insect-specific  flavivirus (ISFV), Aripo virus (ARPV). Preliminary data shows ARPV's host restriction is noticeably later in the  replication cycle than described for other ISFVs and is capable of entering vertebrate cells and developing a  robust immune response in the absence of genomic replication. An ARPV/ZIKV chimera was developed to test  our hypothesis that ARPV/ZIKV vaccination produces a rapid and robust innate, humoral, and cell-mediated  immune response that elicits sterilizing immunity against subsequent ZIKV challenge. Preliminary studies show  a single dose of ARPV/ZIKV produces a robust adaptive ZIKV-specific immune response that completely  protects mice from viremia, weight loss, and mortality, while demonstrating exceptional safety in vivo. This  platform is superior because of the increased safety of the chimera by virtue of its fundamental replication  defect in vertebrate cells, increased immunogenicity due to a lack of inactivation requirements, and efficient  genome delivery to target cells. This innovative and essential R01 aims to evaluate the safety profile,  protective efficacy and mechanisms underlying the immunogenicity of ARPV/ZIKV vaccination via three aims:   1. Determine the efficacy of ARPV/ZIKV immunization for preventing ZIKV-induced disease in murine and   rhesus macaque models.   2. Elucidate the correlates underlying vaccine-induced protection from ZIKV-induced disease in ARPV/ZIKV   vaccinated murine models.   3. Evaluate the safety profile of this vaccine candidate in vitro and in vivo, and elucidate the mechanism   underlying its immunogenicity.  This study will generate a safe, efficacious, single-dose ZIKV vaccine that will be ideally suited to affordably  control explosive outbreaks, which typically affect resource-limited regions. Our platformÃ¢Â€Â™s antigenic superiority  will result in enhanced efficacy, effectively combining the safety of replication-defective virus-like particles or  nucleic acid vaccines with the antigenic superiority, and rapid, long-lived immunogenicity of live-attenuated  vaccines. This platform can also be readily translated to other flaviviruses of human or veterinary importance.",7,7a
P25406,PrimaryBreathe: programme to develop and test a brief remote primary care intervention for chronic breathlessness,"Breathlessness affects the daily lives of one in ten adults, and a quarter of those aged over 70. The number of people experiencing breathlessness is growing worldwide, with increasing long-term health conditions like heart or lung disease. COVID-19 is adding to the problem, as breathlessness can continue long after initial infection.  Being short of breath is disabling and frightening. Breathless people frequently contact their doctors  surgery or call an ambulance. However, doctors and nurses often feel they cannot help, as breathlessness continues despite treating the underlying health condition.  A small number of specialist teams have developed effective ways to support patients to improve their own breathing, without taking additional drugs. However, these teams are usually part of palliative care services and they tend to help people with severe disease, often cancer, nearing the end of life. This type of care now needs to be adapted so that it can be accessed by many more people, with any disease at any stage, and through their regular healthcare teams.  This five-year research programme aims to achieve this by giving general practice staff the skills to help their breathless patients feel better, in control and out of hospital. Patients and staff are enthusiastic about this work and have been giving us advice. For example, they want treatment to be available by telephone or video, so people do not have to leave their homes. The programme will have three parts.  First, the treatment, PrimaryBreathe, will be created by patients, family carers, staff and researchers working together to create a primary care version of the existing breathlessness treatment. After receiving training, primary care staff will support patients to learn techniques to self-manage their breathlessness. The treatment development process will have several stages, to make sure PrimaryBreathe meets everyone s needs and can be properly tested.  Second, we will involve forty general practices from five UK regions, and over 600 patients, to test the treatment. Half the practices will be randomly chosen to provide PrimaryBreathe over four weeks, and the rest will give standard care. Patients and family carers will complete four online questionnaires over six months, measuring their symptoms and experience of caring.  Third, we will generate information to support successful roll-out across UK general practices of what we found to be helpful. Patients and other experts will advise us, and we will take particular care that people from any background can receive this support.  This will be the first time anyone has tried to make breathlessness support available to every person who needs it. National and international organisations are backing this work, and have agreed to help spread the findings to relieve the suffering of the increasing numbers of people living with this distressing symptom.",4,"4c, 4d"

P22204,Innate Immunity of Zika Virus Infection In Human Neural Progenitors,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The 2016 outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas demonstrated how quickly and dramatically a mosquito-borne viral infection can affect human life. Like related flavivirus family members such as West Nile virus, ZIKV can invade and infect the central nervous system (CNS), but is unique in causing in utero infection which leads to developmental abnormalities including microcephaly. ZIKV seems to have a predilection for infecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and persists for months in the fetal CNS after in utero infection, which suggests an ineffective immune control of the virus. We hypothesize that impaired innate immunity in neural progenitor cells underlies increased susceptibility to infection by ZIKV and contributes to microcephaly.  The innate immune system includes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogens and signal through effector molecules including interferon (IFN), which drives the expression of hundreds of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs) as a model for fetal CNS development, we have identified key innate immune signals that are attenuated in neural progenitors compared to mature neurons and glia: the expression levels of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, a PRR that detects viral RNA); and the IFN-driven upregulation of two ISGs (IFIT1 and IFITM1). We now propose to extend these findings as follows: (1) we will define the developmental changes in expression and function of PRRs during neural differentiation using the iNPC system and an established embryonic stem cell line as a control; (2) we will use CRISPR knockout or overexpression of RIG-I in bulk iNPCs and in a cerebral organoid model to test whether insufficient RIG-I signaling underlies iNPC susceptibility to ZIKV infection and microcephaly; (3) we will perform single cell RNA-seq on ZIKV-infected neural progenitors, neurons and glia to identify differentially expressed genes and gene networks, revealing innate immune components that confer susceptibility or resistance to ZIKV; and (4) using CRISPR knockout or overexpression of IFIT1 and IFITM1 we will test the role of these proteins in limiting ZIKV infection in progenitors and cerebral organoids. These experiments will define key innate immune proteins that influence susceptibility or resistance to ZIKV, identifying therapeutic targets to protect the fetal brain during ZIKV infection.  Dr. StokesÃ¢Â€Â™ development plan builds on a background in neurosciences with coursework and hands-on training in immunology, neural stem cells, and bioinformatics. The proposal establishes a mentoring committee including faculty in immunology, neurosciences, and infectious disease to provide guidance and career development. A K08 award will allow Dr. Stokes to make maximal use of UWÃ¢Â€Â™s extensive scientific resources to achieve scientific independence, advancing his career goal to develop therapeutic interventions that protect neural function from injury during viral encephalitis.","1, 4","1c, 1d, 4b"

C19615,COVIH study: COVID-19 burden in HIV infected individuals.,"SARS CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the planet and new mutants emerge which are more transmissible and potentially more resistant to our vaccines.  Few data exist on COVID-19 disease and vaccine immune responses in immunocompromised individuals, specifically in people living with HIV (PLWH).  So far, studies have yielded contradictory results. Several factors can affect COVID disease and vaccine responses in this population including CD4 cell counts, functional immune deficits, as well as socio-demographic conditions and comorbidities such as premature aging phenotypes.  We propose to study in-depth these determinants:  1. We will characterize the prevalence and the evolution of COVID-19 in PLWH using a Montreal cohort of PLWH, and a cohort of individuals infected by SARS CoV-2 (Citadel). 2.We will characterize COVID vaccine immune response in PLWH longitudinally, and we will compare it to vaccine response in the general population using a group of 120 PLWH who have been vaccinated with mRNA Moderna vaccine, and samples from the general population obtained from Hema-Quebec. 3.We will share our results in real-time with public health authorities as well as with the community of PLWH.  We will develope and information program (webinars, social media content) directed at specific PLWH populations addressing questions about the disease, vaccination and impact on HIV management.

The kits will be based on isothermal amplification and rapid PCR of the regions of interest and their rapid detection (15-30 minutes the presence of the virus, available in 1 - 2 months). In a second kit-module, from these amplified and those of interest in relation to the patient, libraries will be generated to be sequenced using Nanopore systems.

C07215,Evaluation of Smoke-Free Housing Policy Impacts on Tobacco Smoke Exposure and Health Outcomes,"ABSTRACT. By mid-June, 2020, COVID-19 associated hospitalization rates among Hispanic/Latino and African-American/Black persons in the United States were 4 and 5 times greater than that of non-HispanicWhite persons. New York City (NYC) became the epicenter of COVID-19 early in the epidemic and disturbing patterns of COVID-related disparities rapidly emerged. The Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) initiative supports supplements to individual NIH awards to increase COVID-19 testing among underserved populations. For this proposal, we leverage the infrastructure of a current project in NYC(NCI R01CA220591 ""Evaluation of Smoke-Free Housing Policy Impacts on Tobacco Smoke Exposure"") and longstanding partnerships between the NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA), the NYC Health Department. The NYC public hospital system responsible for contact tracing (NYC Health + Hospitals) and a robust set of community partners to execute a data-informed, community-engaged research to develop and test strategiesto increase adoption of COVID-19 testing among NYC public housing residents. NYCHA is the largest public housing authority in North America, with more than 400,000 official residents living in 15% of the nation's public housing units. Median family income is $20,000, and approximately 90% of NYCHA residents are either black or Hispanic.     Our aims are to:   1) Develop a sustainable community engagement infrastructure to guide current and future deployment of evidence-based COVID-19 testing and vaccination options for NYC Public Housingresidents;   2) Quantify inequities in COVID testing and SARS CoV-2 infection among Public Housing residents;  3) Engage NYCHA residents and community based organization partners in primary data collection and analysis to understand barriers to testing, isolation and follow-up care; and   4) Test community-informed strategies to increase testing uptake.     Specifically, we aim to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial totest the added value of adding navigation services to teams of community health worker (CHWs) and residentnavigators offering a menu of COVID-19 testing referral options. We will compare impacts on reach,acceptability and adoption of COVID-19 diagnostic testing. By capitalizing on strong partnerships, robustmunicipal data sources that support real-time prospective surveillance, and a rapidly expanding array of testing initiatives, this implementation study offers an unparalleled opportunity to identify effective strategies to reduce disparities in COVID risk and health outcomes in a large, high-need population. Findings will be used to develop guidance for implementing testing strategies in multi-unit and public housing settings nationally.","3, 4, 5, 9","3c, 3d, 4c, 5a, 9a, 9b"

P21674,Dissecting catalytic and regulatory functions of nonsegmented negative strandRNA viral polymerases,"Non-segmented negative strand (NNS) RNA viruses, such as rabies virus (RABV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), and Ebola virus (EBOV), pose continuing threats to human health, but there are currently no established prophylactic and/or therapeutic countermeasures against most NNS RNA viral diseases. NNS RNA viruses possess a multifunctional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) large (L) protein, which catalyzes all enzymatic reactions required for viral RNA biogenesis (e.g., RNA synthesis, 5Ã¢Â€Â²-capping, cap methylation at the guanine-N7- and ribose-2Ã¢Â€Â²-O-positions, 3Ã¢Â€Â²-polyadenylation). All these enzymatic activities of the L proteins are unique and potentially druggable. Our goals are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of RNA synthesis and processing with the L proteins and to develop anti-viral agents against them. To dissect the roles of the L proteins in RNA biosynthesis, we have developed a number of in vitro rhabdoviral RNA synthesis and processing systems for prototypic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV. Using these systems, we discovered that rhabdoviral L proteins catalyze unconventional mRNA capping with a novel GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase, EC 2.7.7.88) domain. However, the mechanisms of pre- mRNA capping and methylation coupled to mRNA chain elongation remain largely unknown. Furthermore, virus- specific functions of L proteins have not been studied. We hypothesize that L proteins catalyze common enzymatic reactions via evolutionary conserved elements, but manifest virus-specific functions via diversified elements. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested by the following specific aims: to elucidate the mechanisms of (1) co-transcriptional mRNA maturation by rhabdoviral L proteins, (2) cap formation by pneumoviral and paramyxoviral L proteins, and (3) transcription and replication by filoviral L proteins. In Aim 1, we will determine the timing and order of pre-mRNA processing by the VSV L protein during mRNA chain elongation, leading to a new model of co-transcriptional mRNA maturation by L proteins of rhabdoviruses and, by extension, other NNS RNA viruses. In Aim 2, we will reveal common and diversified functions of putative PRNTase and methyltransferase domains of the HRSV and HPIV3 L proteins in mRNA cap formation. In Aim 3, we will provide a novel model for genome replication by the EBOV L protein that is significantly different from that by other NNS RNA viral L proteins. Collectively, the proposed studies will open up a new frontier in understanding how diversified NNS L proteins carry out each step of RNA synthesis and processing together with their cognate co- factor proteins. Our studies will provide foundations for the future development of antiviral agents targeting unique L domains of these significant NNS RNA viruses.",1,"1b, 1c"

The impacts of the pandemic and the changes to regular life all affect mental health. These affects might be more severe for people who experience other challenges or are in particularly stressful circumstances, including healthcare workers, people experiencing homelessness, women, the elderly, children, people living with existing mental health and substance use conditions, and victims of domestic violence. People who are at-risk might also have a more challenging time accessing mental health care. Because the pandemic is global, its affects are felt worldwide. The way that countries respond can provide important lessons for Canada and other parts of the world. The Asia Pacific region includes Canada and is home to 40% of the world's population. Countries in the region have grappled with COVID-19 at different stages and have taken different approaches to addressing mental health. All countries have challenges with making sure that mental health services reach those most at-risk and there is an opportunity to learn from each other. The use of digital mental health care has increased during the pandemic. While digital mental health has potential to improve access to care, there are also challenges with making sure it reaches at-risk groups. This study, led by the APEC Digital Hub for Mental Health, brings together a network of researchers, healthcare providers and policy makers to rapidly synthesize information about the needs of at-risk groups in the Asia Pacific, challenges they face to accessing mental health care, and the possibilities of using digital health to improve their care.

The animal models that best predict what therapies will perform similarly in humans are those that closely replicate the human condition. Primates closely resemble humans but rapid high-throughput evaluation of drugs in this animal model is not feasible for economic and ethical reasons. We are producing a unique mouse model that contains human lung implants that support SARS-CoV-2 infection and a human immune system capable of responding to the infection.  This animal model thus closely replicates COVID-19 disease seen in humans. These mice are in high demand to evaluate drugs that have already proven safe for the treatment of other diseases and drugs showing strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in the laboratory. We will produce these mice and rapidly assess some of the most promising therapeutic candidates that have been identified as potential treatments of COVID-19.

The overall goal of the proposed testing research project is to decrease disparities in the morbidity and mortality patterns for COVID-19 through engaged partnerships with several communities in central California that are both historically underserved and vulnerable to COVID-19, namely the Latinx. These communities currently are experiencing infection rates that are three times higher than whites, and are among the highest in the U.S.They also are among the most socially and economically disadvantaged, have high rates of co-morbidities such as diabetes and asthma, live in overcrowded housing, and reside in some of the most polluted areas of the country. A high proportion are undocumented and employed in food production, especially farm labor,performing essential work that has been a backbone of the California economy, while simultaneously being marginalized.     The proposed research will build upon long-term existing partnerships with an array of community-based organizations and trusted leaders in Latinx communities to develop interventions that address the barriers to SARS-CoV2 diagnostics, as part of a larger strategy to reduce transmission and control the pandemic in the Latinx population of central California. Because of the dynamic changes in incidence,shifting hubs of transmission, and policy changes from authorities, a comparator trial of different community-developed interventions is needed to provide information on which actions are feasible, acceptable, and effective. Hence, comparisons will be made between the Latinx population and whites in the same counties,and among Latinx persons from counties having different interventions, with adjustment for infection incidence rates and trajectories, as well as local policy changes and government interventions.     We will pursue the overall goal with the following specific aims:   1) Determine the epidemiology of COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 related mortality, and SARS-CoV-2 testing rates in selected Latinx and white non-Latinx communities of targeted California counties,   2) Develop strategies to increase testing and reduce rates of infection in the targeted areas in collaboration with community partners and,   3) Disseminate information and knowledge gained from this project back to partnering communities, other grantees from this and other COVID-19 initiatives by full participation in RADx-UP Coordinating Data and Collection Center (CDCC), to the broad public, and to policy-makers.

Hesitant people may refuse certain vaccines or delay vaccination, and these behaviors have been linked to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles. This is of particular concern in the context of vaccination against COVID-19, as vaccine hesitancy could negatively affect the success of the vaccination campaign. This program therefore aims to better understand why people are reluctant to get vaccinated or to have their child(ren) vaccinated, as well as to examine why some health professionals are reluctant to vaccinate.

P22732,Biophysical studies of viral membrane fusion proteins,"SUMMARY  Influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) is the canonical example of a class-I viral fusion protein, and thus  provides an ideal model system for understanding the fusion mechanisms of many different viruses. Numerous  other viral envelope glycoproteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike, are believed to mediate fusion by a  comparable mechanism. Our long-term goal is to establish a complete mechanistic framework of class-I viral  fusion. We further aim to identify conserved and divergent features of the fusion mechanisms of distinct viruses,  generating specific models that fit within the general framework. HA resides on the surface of the IAV virion and  facilitates attachment to the target cell surface through the receptor-binding domain (HA1) engaging SA moieties.  Following endocytosis and trafficking to the late endosome, HA promotes fusion of the viral and endosomal  membranes. The model of HA-mediated membrane fusion describes a Ã¢Â€Âœspring-loadedÃ¢Â€Â metastable prefusion  conformation at neutral pH. Dissociation of HA1 from the fusion domain (HA2) allows HA2 to undergo a cascade  of conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. While extensive structural data exist for HA pre- and  postfusion, and alternative conformations have been visualized and inferred, the conformational trajectory that  leads to membrane fusion, including the adoption of anticipated intermediates, has never been explicitly  validated. Nor has the order and timing of conformational changes and membrane fusion been determined. Here,  we will utilize a multifaceted approach involving single-molecule FÃƒÂ¶rster resonance energy transfer imaging,  single-virion fusion, cryoelectron tomography, and molecular dynamic simulation to directly visualize the  conformational trajectory undergone by HA during membrane fusion. We will explore the roles of virion  morphology, HA density and cooperativity, and target membrane lipid content in mediating HA conformational  changes and the mechanism of fusion. We will describe the allosteric connection between distal regions of HA  that regulate the timing of fusion, drawing comparison to SARS-CoV-2 S.

This is particularly true for LGBT+ groups who already face elevated rates of physical and mental health challenges, as well as socio-structural barriers that limit the effectiveness and feasibility of recommended preventive measures such as physical distancing and handwashing. These health and social disparities greatly increase the vulnerability of LGBT+ people to COVID-19, and compound with other forms of marginalization such as race/ethnicity, gender, age, and HIV status, as well as unstable housing and employment, healthcare discrimination, and violence. There is an absence of coordinated and community-engaged responses to reduce the risk of COVID-19 for these groups.     To address these challenges, this project will adapt, test, and disseminate a community-engaged eHealth intervention with diverse LGBT+ populations to reduce their risk of COVID-19 infection. The research team will test the intervention'Äôs effectiveness in increasing COVID-19 knowledge and protective behaviours, and in reducing psychological distress among LGBT+ people in Canada, India, and Thailand. The results of this project will reduce the risk of COVID-19 for LGBT+ people and will also better inform health system and public health responses to support engagement of LGBT+ and other marginalized populations in the pandemic response.    The project was selected for funding through the COVID-19 May 2020 Rapid Research Funding Opportunity, coordinated by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in partnership with IDRC and several other health research funding agencies across Canada.",9,"9a, 9b, 9c"
C15216,The Development of Reversible Covalent PROTAC Technology as a New Anti-COVID-19 Strategy,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global health emergency. However, to date,  no effective targeted drug or vaccine has been identified yet. Finding effective targeted treatment options is of  paramount importance. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sensed RNA virus. Main protease (Mpro), a  cysteine protease, is essential for viral replication and pathogenesis which represents an attractive target for the  development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. One of the traditional antiviral strategies is to develop high-  affinity ligands that bind directly to viral proteins and inhibit their functions like SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (SC2Mpro).  However, these occupancy-driven inhibitors may lead to several potential problems such as off-target toxicity,  dose-limiting toxicity, and drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need for new antiviral strategies that can  address these challenges by exploiting alternative mechanisms to combat existing CoV pathogens like SARS-  CoV-2. Proteolytic targeting chimaera (PROTAC) is an emerging technology for targeted protein degradation in  drug discovery. PROTACs are event-driven bifunctional small molecules that simultaneously engage an E3  ubiquitin ligase and a target protein to facilitate the formation of a ternary complex, leading to the ubiquitination  and ultimate degradation of the target protein. PROTACs have many potential advantages compared to  traditional occupancy-based inhibitors, including (i) catalytic nature to allow for sub-stoichiometric activity, (ii)  enhanced target selectivity, (iii) high barrier to resistance; and (iv) abrogating all functions of the target protein  and its downstream proteins. On this basis, this proposal provides an innovative anti-CoV strategy: reversible  covalent PROTACs by combination of the advantages of ultra-potent reversible covalent SC2Mpro inhibitors and  event-driven PROTAC technology. The overall goal is to validate degradation of SC2Mpro as a new strategy for  developing COVID-19 drugs with improved selectivity and efficacy. The current proposal is built upon the  preliminary work on the discovery of several potent reversible covalent SC2Mpro inhibitors (lowest IC50 < 10 nM)  and one small-molecule SC2Mpro PROTAC degrader. Encouraged by these exciting preliminary studies, the goal  will be achieved by pursuing the following aims: (1) the development of cellular systems to evaluate degradation  of SC2Mpro; (2) the development of various potent reversible covalent anti-CoV PROTACs targeting SC2Mpro; (3)  the exploration of the relationship between SC2Mpro degradation potencies and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of  reversible covalent anti-CoV PROTACs. The successful completion of the proposed study will not only lead to  potent anti-CoV PROTACs with good drug-like properties that can be potentially advanced to pre-clinical  evaluation for treating COVID-19, but also will provide a proof-of-concept study for more broadly developing anti-  CoV PROTACs against various coronaviruses.",6,6a
P23424,The evolution of host-flavivirus interactions and their impact on viral pathogenesis and host response,"The ability of viruses to rapidly change is key to their success, allowing them to quickly adapt to new hosts as well as to replicate in extremely different environments. Understanding how viruses evolve to efficiently infect in new environments as well as revealing the barriers and limitations to this capacity are important to predicting emerging threats and to designing novel therapeutic interventions.     This project focuses on the flaviviruses, a group that includes many human pathogens such as the dengue virus and the zika virus. These viruses infect millions of humans across the world every year, causing widespread mortality and morbidity, especially in developing countries. These pathogens are transmitted to humans from ticks and insects, and they are thus able to replicate in two extremely different host environments. The molecular mechanisms that affect the potential of flaviviruses to shift hosts and become a new human pathogen remain poorly understood. An important factor contributing to virus replication within a given host is the virus'Äô capacity to inhibit intracellular host defences by direct interactions with the host proteins involved in innate immune responses. A non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is common to all flaviviruses and is believed to be important for modulating host innate immune response.     This project aims to investigate the hypothesis that NS5 diversity among flaviviruses is central to host modulation and virus spread. The project will create a comprehensive map of its interactions with human and mosquito proteins and study how host-flavivirus interactions impact on host immune processes.     This project was selected for funding during the second research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program 'Äì Phase II (Communicable Diseases). The program is a partnership between IDRC, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Israel Science Foundation and the Azrieli Foundation.",1,"1b, 1c"
C19779,Production of a recombinant S ( spike ) protein vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging coronaviruses,"In December 2019 a human coronavirus (CoV) outbreak causing pneumonia-like symptoms began, centered around a fish market in the Wuhan district of China. After the genomic sequence was determined the causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, showed 99.98% identity among 9 patients, was 88% identical to two bat SARS-like CoV, ~79% identical to SARS-CoV, and ~50% identical to MERS-CoV (Tan 2020 Lancet). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were responsible for severe human illness and mortality (~10% in 2002 and ~35% in 2013, respectively). Although understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease is ongoing, it is believed human-to-human transmission is possible and the disease fatality rate is ~2-3%. In early February 2020, WHO reported >31,000 confirmed human infections, >640 deaths, and declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, presumably due to the possibility of a pandemic. The coronavirus 2019 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak causing a severe human disease in the past ~20 years. Currently a coronavirus prophylaxis vaccine and therapeutic drugs are not available.  In this application we describe the investigation of vaccine candidates. Our team has manufacturing experience expressing a subunit Hepatitis-C virus vaccine candidate and has developed methods for industry-scale vaccine purification using removable purification tags (Logan 2017 Journal of Virology).

C00374,SARS-CoV-2 -KIDS Study: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) among children (<18y) in Germany: time series in sentinel children's hospitals,"SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly and globally, but little is known about the distribution and mode of spreading in Germany. Since it is expected that COVID-19 will be comparatively harmless or even asymptomatic in children, it can be assumed that a high number of infections in this group will be not detected, causing children to act as spreaders of the infection.  The aim of this study is to obtain a prospective monthly estimate of the seroprevalence of an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents in Germany in the period from 01.05.2020 to 30.04.2021 in 12 sentinel children's hospitals and thereby describe the yearly course of the epidemic in children and adolescents:   • What is the maximum prevalence reached at the peak of the epidemic?  • When does the monthly increment flatten?  • Are there differences with the temporal course by age, sex, and region?   • What is the estimated burden of suffering related to the SARS-Cov-2 in children?  • Does the burden of suffering vary by age, sex, ethnicity or underlying disease?  • Which proportion of confirmed positive cases has been previously diagnosed by a physician or other medical experts?  Data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children are mandatory for understanding the previous epidemiology and for guidance of the management of the epidemic in the future.",3,3d
C15099,Community-Academic Partnerships to Address COVID-19 Inequities within African American Communities,"Abstract  In a few months' time, the emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a highly contagious disease  resulting from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), sickened millions and  killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. As with many other communicable and non-  communicable diseases, African Americans disproportionately bear the burden of elevated rates of COVID-19-  related morbidity and mortality. The rise in negative sentiments towards wearing masks in public, interpersonal  and structural racism, and inability to shelter-in-place further exacerbate risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for  members of vulnerable populations, including African Americans. With recent projections estimating that nearly  50,000 more Americans will die of COVID-19-related complications by December 2020, with at least 30% likely  to be African American, it is clear that current public health efforts, which are overwhelmingly expert-driven and  top-down, are failing. As such, innovative solutions that: 1) empower and equip communities to play an active  role in promoting public health and responsiveness, 2) leverage community assets and multisectoral  partnerships, and 3) facilitate a sense of unity and collective responsibility are sorely needed if we are to  contain SARS-CoV-2 and eliminate COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst those  suffering disproportionately worse outcomes. Public health campaigns and non-pharmaceutical interventions  (NPIs) that are community-driven and developed in collaboration with community members, public health  agencies, and researchers may offer a more acceptable and effective approach that could enable the US to  drastically reduce COVID-19 transmission and address individual and socio-structural barriers that lead to  worse COVID-19-related outcomes among African Americans. Our study goals are to use a crowdsourcing  contest to identify exceptional ideas that promote COVID-19 testing and encourage the public to adopt health-  promotive behaviors. We will then conduct a randomized experiment to examine the impact of the contest on  the targeted health-promotive behaviors. Next, in partnership with Project Grace, an academic-community  partnership in rural NC, we will initiate an NPI called the Rapid Response Team, which will be a community-  based contact tracing and case investigation program that will focus on identifying local COVID-19 infections in  their communities, providing assistance and information regarding implementing safety protocols, and meeting  existing needs of community members within a rural community in North Carolina by leveraging NCCARE360,  a new digital, statewide coordinated care network intended to better connect individuals to local services and  resources. Then, we will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and reach of the Rapid Response Team  regarding contacting community members and linking them to local resources as needed, increasing COVID-  19 testing, and increasing the practice of the 3Ws among adults in rural, Eastern North Carolina.",9,"9a, 9b"
C10091,The other keyworkers in care homes: implications of including domestic staff in social care workforce strategies and practices relating to Covid-19 recovery,"Ancillary or domestic workers in care homes are key to infection control, routine cleaning and housekeeping tasks; they engage with residents; and assist care workers providing personal care. In general, information available depicts the ancillary workforce as: low paid, but facing high risks; comprising many shielded workers, unsure about coming to work; once at work, uncertain about their safety; and worried about residents and their own families contracting Covid-19. The picture, however, lacks clarity, with ancillary workers presented as both much loved by residents, but also possible sources of contagion. These competing views encourage the development of evidence-based policy-making and workforce strategies. This 10-month study addresses the following research questions over 2 phases: How have ancillary workers experienced the pandemic, in particular its impact on their work role, personal safety and mental health, organisational commitment, and workplace support? How have work practices been changing during the pandemic from the perspective of ancillary workers, their managers, HR managers, residents and staff? Has the treatment of ancillary workers been perceived to impact care quality in homes according to multiple perspectives? How can policy and practice be developed to ensure ancillary workers are better prepared, supported and equipped to deal with future waves of Covid-19 and beyond as services are reopened and reset? How did demographic features of the ancillary workforce - BAME background, migrant, socio-economic status - impact on work-related experiences of the pandemic, with implications for staff safety and wellbeing? What does documentary analysis of care homes policies and other sources, for example Care Quality Commission (CQC) reports, tell us about support of ancillary staff? What international evidence is available about practices of supporting ancillary staff in care homes? What would be are the elements of a co-produced good practice model for managing and supporting ancillary staff in care homes in the Covid-19 context? Phase 1 will include interviews with: 50 ancillary staff; 15-20 care home and Human Resource managers; 8-10 residents and relatives. We will examine care home documents: inspectors reports, staff handbooks, job descriptions, to develop a comprehensive picture of the work context. Drawing upon our networks, we will interview people in different types of care homes, and with different personal/employment characteristics, to examine how management practice reflects variety of ancillary staff and activity in the Covid-19 context. In Phase 2, we will use findings from Phase 1 to co-produce a good practice model for employing and supporting ancillary or housekeeping staff in care homes relevant to policy making in Covid-19 and social care. We will get feedback from stakeholders and finalise a consensus model that increases support for these staff in recovery or reorientation of care home services. Study outputs will include: a detailed report on experiences and treatment of ancillary staff during the pandemic from different stakeholder perspectives; and a coproduced good practice model for policymakers and for care home providers. We will publicise our resources to managers responsible for HR, care home managers, wider care home sector; and produce policy options for national social care policymakers.",10,"10b, 10d"
P26244,A mixed methods study to understand and promote COVID-19 vaccination among children and youth: the TARGetKids! Study of Children and Families,"Vaccinating children and youth against COVID-19 is essential to resuming essential social and economic activities. Currently, the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are approved for individuals 12 years of age and older in Canada. Clinical trials for children younger than 12 years of age are underway, and COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be available for children of all ages soon. To date, little is known about vaccine hesitancy for pediatric COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination decision-making is a complex process influenced by multiple factors. In order to guide the development of strategies to promote equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution for children, high-quality evidence from a diverse population of children and parents is needed to understand COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy as well as the factors which influence vaccine decision-making among children, their parents, and primary healthcare providers. In April 2020, we utilized Canada's largest children's primary care research network, The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGetKids!), to collect COVID-19 related data on children and their parents, including emerging data on COVID-19 vaccination. We now have extensive data on multiple health and well-being measures from children and their parents pre and during the pandemic. We propose to extend this work to understand COVID-19 vaccination among children, youth, their parents, and primary healthcare providers over the next year. With detailed socio-demographic data collected from a diverse population (one in three children participating in the TARGetKids!

P23841,"Boosting Societal Adaptation and Mental Health in a Rapidly Digitalizing, Post-Pandemic Europe","BACKGROUND:  Adolescents are at particularly high risk for digital technology overuse, including in response to the COVID pandemic, and are therefore vulnerable for its potential harmful effects on mental health. Problematic usage of the internet (PUI) is thought to represent a marker of disrupted self-management, with major consequences for individual and societal health and wellbeing.    AIM:   Bootstrap brings together a multidisciplinary consortium aiming to initiate health and social policy and practice change designed to reduce the harmful effects of digitalization on mental health, particularly for young people.     APPROACH:   We will co-create a digital screening and assessment platform to understand which individuals are at-risk for developing PUI. Algorithm-based models will be used to predict which individual will benefit from which type of self-management intervention, and these preventative behavioral interventions will be tested for their (cost)effectiveness. Finally, we will develop a policy toolkit in co-design with stakeholders, to promote human digital rights accountability at the local, national, and European level.    IMPACT:  Bootstrap will provide unprecedented scientific knowledge on the psychological mechanisms underlying (risk for) PUI and potential interventions. Improved self-management and tools to optimize healthy internet usage will promote mental health and prevent mental ill health in adolescents, and contribute to reducing stigma. In addition, our policy toolkit will empower policy makers and private companies to (self)regulate with the intent to protect vulnerable groups. In the long run, Bootstrap will thus contribute to improving mental wellbeing across Europe and beyond.",10,10d

C14377,SARS COV2 vaccine ResPonse In Obesity - SCORPIO study,"Over 20% of the UK population are obese; people with obesity have substantially higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. As obese people have reduced immune responses to other vaccines (influenza, hepatitis), we hypothesise that obesity may similarly reduce the protection offered by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by impairing cellular immunity, reducing initial antibody titres and/or by causing an acceleration of the natural decline in antibody titres. We will address this question by recruiting a cohort of 200  patients with severe obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI)>40 kg/m2) - the population we suspect is at highest risk - from clinics in Cambridge University Hospital and Kings College Hospital, London (SCORPIO study). We will compare their vaccine responses (T and B cell-mediated immunity, neutralisation assay, anti-Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies, inflammatory cytokines) to 1500 normal weight people studied using the same assays. To comprehensively investigate the impact on vaccine responses of BMI across the full range from overweight, to obese and severely obese, we will collaborate with a network of investigators leading existing UK studies to perform a meta-analysis of 50,000 people. We will seek to identify predictive nutritional and metabolomic biomarkers (obese responders vs non-responders) and test whether weight loss (shown to improve response to the influenza vaccine in mice) can improve vaccine responses in obese people. This ambitious programme of research will deliver new insights into the relationship between BMI, metabolic health and the response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and inform public health policy in this area, within 12 months.","1, 7","1d, 7l, 7y"

The outbreak of COVID-19 and the life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome caused by the virus(SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) have led to a severe, global public health crisis, and economic disruption. Sadly, inthis epidemic, NYC is the epicenter of epicenters. Some neighborhoods in NYC have been more exposed thanothers to COVID, and there seems to be clear correlation with the prevalence of COVID and its severity betweencertain ethnic and racial populations. Importantly, it is recognized that biology factors alone do not exclusivelyaccount for disease outcomes in those stricken with Covid-19. Social determinants have a significant impact onvarious health-related outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, kidney and lung disease (1,2).Evidence also indicates that a myriad of social risk factors- such as low income, poor education, minority raceor ethnic background- coupled with inadequate community housing and resources, together with limited healthcare access and decreased health utilization, results in poor health outcomes and increased susceptibility andseverity to Covid-19 (3-14). For this study, we assembled a multidisciplinary team from Weill Cornell Medicine'sClinical Translational Science Center (CTSC); Englander Institute for Precision Medicine (EIPM), the WeillCornell's Center for Health Equity. The initial study will be conducted with the New York Presbyterian (NYP)Hospital health care system database involving ""hotspot"" areas in NYC with COVID. The NYP network is thelargest healthcare system by bed counts in New York City and is on the frontlines of the struggle against theCOVID pandemic. By discerning the interaction/relationship of the biology with the Social Determinants of Health(SDoH), we will gain further insight into why certain racial and ethnic groups are more susceptible to Covid -19,and why they develop the more severe forms of the virus. Furthermore, if we are able to identify the especiallyvulnerable, and provide adequate isolation and early medical intervention in the disease process- then we cansave lives. Protecting and providing preventive and early care for the vulnerable would also allow the remainderof society to interact in daily activities and prevent the economy from a major collapse. The less vulnerable whoare out in society would on average develop mild coronavirus infections. Consequently, once the larger andmildly affected less vulnerable population recover and gain natural immunity, the risk to the most vulnerablewould fall dramatically and the country would stabilize.","3, 4","3b, 4b"
C04606,Supporting the Business Response to COVID-19: Survey on Technology Adoption,"This research project builds the evidence base on technology adoption, and examines how government can best support businesses, in particular small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), in the UK at a time of crisis. Working in collaboration with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), this project will design and undertake a new survey of businesses across the UK to shed light on the extent to which, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, businesses have introduced new technologies or organisational practices that are considered ""productivity enhancing"" in normal times. It will seek to understand the drivers and impacts of such innovation, business perceptions on these, and the relative effectiveness of different business support policies from the perspectives of businesses themselves.  Via a follow-up survey one year on (and linking to secondary data sources), we will examine whether such innovation persists into the longer run, its impact on firm survival, performance, employment and worker productivity; and how government policy might promote the persistence of productivity enhancing changes into the recovery phase.  The first deliverable will be a report summarising the data, including analysis of heterogeneity by sector, region and firm type. The second deliverable will be a report summarising the findings of the combined initial and follow on surveys. Collaborating with the CBI in these bespoke business surveys will help to create relevant and informative questions on product and process innovation, enablers and barriers to innovation, and business views on potential policy levers for the recovery. The project will seek to inform business support policies to enable firms to survive, adapt and grow out of the current crisis.",10,"10c, 10d"
P26552,How do flaviviruses orchestrate viral RNA replication and virion assembly?,"Flaviviruses, including Zika virus and Dengue virus, are mosquito-borne pathogens of public health concern, with more than 2.2 billion people at risk of infection. While many cases remain asymptomatic, symptomatic infections lead to rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, and conjunctivitis. More serious complications include hepatitis, vascular shock syndrome, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, congenital abnormalities, and fetal death. Despite decades of research, our understanding of the fundamental biology of flaviviruses, including how they replicate their genomes and build viral particles, remains rudimentary. Today, the technologies exist to allow us to tease apart the roles of the main viral proteins in mediating these processes. Herein, we are studying two viral proteins known to participate in both the process of viral genome replication and viral particle assembly, and are therefore highly lucrative targets for antiviral intervention. Insight into these processes, and how the viral proteins interact with one another and with the viral genome, will allow us to develop novel antiviral strategies and design new vaccination approaches for these important human pathogens. Moreover, given the conservation of these viral proteins across the flavivirus genus, our results are likely to be applicable to several other important human pathogens.",1,"1b, 1c"

C13803,In people with Long Covid does adding a digital health platform to usual care improve outcomes at three months compared to usual care alone? The Enhancing Covid Rehabilitation with Technology (ECORT) randomised controlled trial,"About one in five people who test positive for covid-19 continue to have symptoms for longer than five weeks. Similar long-term consequences of infection were described by physicians following the Russian Flu in the 1890's, the Spanish Flu in 1919 and more recently after SARS and MERS. The commonest symptoms are fatigue and breathlessness, but symptoms are highly variable and have been described involving most body systems. The variety of different presentations makes describing a clear treatment pathway difficult. Currently, rehabilitation for Long Covid involves education, symptom management, managed goal setting and support in navigating the health system. In other chronic disorders, symptom tracking, changing treatment in response to alterations in symptoms (measurement-based care) and case management are more effective than usual care in improving outcomes. There is some evidence that these activities can be delivered more effectively using digital platforms, usually with a patient-facing app and a clinician-facing dashboard. There have been no trials of such platforms in Long Covid rehabilitation programs.  This study aims to complete a randomized controlled trial in people with Long Covid to test the effectiveness of a digital health platform, NexJ (https://www.nexjhealth.com/). Participants will be recruited from two specialist Long Covid rehabilitation clinics. The main aim of the study is to see whether, in people with Long Covid, adding NexJ to usual care improves quality of life after 12 weeks compared to usual care alone. We will also ask participants about their experience of using NexJ. As part of the trial, we will examine the cost-effectiveness of NexJ and the best way to implement it.   If we show NexJ improves outcomes it has the potential to be rapidly rolled out in Canada to provide personalized rehabilitation for people with Long Covid.",4,"4c, 4d, 4e"
P21171,Wirelessly controlled BSL3 vivarium system for automated microdosing in studies of infectious diseases,"Project Summary Infectious diseases are caused by micro-organisms, such as bacteria, protozoa, viruses or fungi, which can be transferred through direct or indirect human contact. A viral infection occurs when a host's body is invaded by pathogenic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 and the current pandemic. This pandemic is the greatest public health challenge since the 1918 influenza pandemic and the biggest threat to destabilizing the global economy since World War II. As viruses tend to mutate quicker than other pathogenic agents (and thus newer strains emerge time and again), continuous research is required to combat infectious agents. For preclinical research, the most frequently used animal models are mice and rats. They offer an optimal combination of genetic proximity to humans, cost for breeding and colony maintenance possibilities due to their small size. Mice offer the broadest spectrum of available models. Rats are the second most frequently used mammal animal model. In fact, several SARS-CoV- 2 researchers are turning to rats. They are no more susceptible to COVID-19 than mice, but their larger size is an advantage, as, for example, researchers often want to do repetitive bleeding in an experiment but cannot do that with mice. Furthermore, as vaccine studies often assess how different doses affect antibody responses over several days, most toxicology studies of drugs also start in rat. To achieve intermittent infusions in most non-infectious disease research, the current prevailing administration modes for small animal research are manual (oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous) requiring repeated handling by trained technicians. However, infectious disease researchers desire the least number of touchpoints possible with their infected animals, especially when sharp needles are involved The proposed FluidSync BSL3 system may aid the discovery of new treatments for COVID-19 by enabling candidate drugs to be administered to model animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 while minimizing investigator contact. It may also be used in the development of vaccines and antibodies. The system builds on the first and only wireless and tether-free administration system that can be used in animals as small as mice. The new system will have new capabilities including i) a medical-grade primary battery and ii) a programmable system-on-chip including Bluetooth telemetry transceiver, processor and memory. Ultimately, the FluidSync BSL3 microinfusion system would enable an intelligent instrumented vivarium system that addresses many BSL3 user requirements with benefits including increased productivity, reduced researcher exposure to potentially toxic drugs and disease vectors, ease of management of large-scale animal studies, and minimized animal handling to reduce white coat effects.",6,"6a, 6i"
P23498,Consolidation of national eHealth infrastructure for combined genomic-epidemiologic surveillance of infectious diseases,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission established the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA). It strengthens the European Health Union with better preparedness and response to future national, cross-border or pandemic outbreaks of infectious disease. The HERA-Incubator-2021 project was launched by HERA, and its implementation in Belgium makes it possible to develop a national infrastructure for the collection of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data and to build a sustainable infrastructure in which genomic data can be linked to clinical and epidemiological data. This can be used more broadly to anticipate outbreaks and manage risks. The project aims to process larger data volumes in case of major outbreaks or a pandemic. The HERA-Incubator-2021 action was set up as a proof-of-principle. A design of the structure and processes for the clinical, microbiological and genomic data transition was obtained through facilitation of healthdata.be. A central BioIT platform, connected to the data collection, will provide automated pipelines for autonomic processing of genomic data, which will allow harmonised pathogen analyses. Five pilot national reference centers (NRCs) for human microbiology will demonstrate the transition towards the national eHealth infrastructure. With this project proposal developments of the previous action will be consolidated and further expanded. The focus will lie on enhancing base functionalities, i.e. data input/output platform, central BioIT platform, central NRC platform, and roll-out to other participants, i.e. more laboratories and pathogens. Additionally, a strong investment will be made on the communication and dissemination of the project and its objectives. We aim to highlight the future possibilities of the national eHealth infrastructure for public health response in relation to genomics-based infectious disease outbreak investigations, surveillance and overall pandemic preparedness.","11, 12","11d, 12d"

By beginning of February, the number of infected people surpasses 42,000 infections, and the death toll continues to rise. As authorities and responders are struggling to contain the spread, news about mass quarantine camps or shortages of personal protective equipment threaten the health systems globally, fueled by rumors and mis-information. The disruptions of (medical) supply chains, the lack of capacity to treat patients and the spread of rumours fuel an atmosphere of uncertainty and mistrust, hampering an effective response. While traditional models of disease outbreaks largely focus on infection rates, new methods are needed to integrate behaviour from the bottom up, and integrated in macro-level models to coordinate the response world-wide.",14,
P21586,Study of Tecovirimat for Human Monkeypox Virus (STOMP),"PROJECT SUMMARY  The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) has been at the forefront of clinical research to advance HIV  therapeutics and improve the health of patients living with HIV/AIDS for 25 years. Rigorous scientific research  conducted by the ACTG has laid the cornerstones for current HIV treatment guidelines. In this application for  the competitive renewal of the ACTG Network Laboratory Center, we propose a transformative laboratory  research agenda that draws on an international consortium of prominent clinical and laboratory investigators in  collaboration with a world-class Statistical and Data Management Center to conduct leading edge laboratory  research, testing, assay development and laboratory training for the support of innovative interventional clinical  trials. The component ACTG Network Laboratory Center will improve scientific knowledge and technical  capability by providing state-of-the-art laboratory support in the four NIH/DAIDS priority areas of strategies to  cure HIV; improve the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis; identify strategies to cure infectious viral  hepatitis; improve the treatment and prevention of non-infectious co-morbidities associated with HIV infection  and evaluate novel interventions targeting HIV infection. In addition, the Laboratory Center will provide  laboratory support for therapeutic studies of oral manifestations of HIV/AIDS and virally mediated cancers. The  continued expansion of an effective, quality-assured laboratory program at domestic and international sites for  protocol safety measures, state-of-the-art molecular assays for virology and mycobacteriology; immunology  and biomarkers; pharmacology; genomics; and oral pathogens associated with HIV-1 infection, will provide the  essential framework for advancing the scientific agenda of the ACTG Network. The Laboratory Center will  continue to provide oversight of established specimen and human DNA repositories for the ACTG Network,  harmonize specific laboratory testing and standardized operating procedures with other Networks where  feasible and continue to support the laboratory training of technologists and investigators domestically and  internationally.",6,6h
C00863,Rapid Generation of Vaccine Candidates Against Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Using the Bacteriophage T4 Nanoparticle Platform,"This proposal aims to rapidly generate vaccine candidates against the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Since its emergence about three months ago, this virus has caused more than 120,000 infections and 4,300deaths worldwide and is rapidly spreading to virtually every country including the United States. This globalhealth emergency must be immediately addressed by rapidly developing medial countermeasures. Our bacteriophage (phage) T4 vaccine platform is uniquely suited to address this threat. Developed in PI'slaboratory, the T4 vaccines have been proven to generate robust humoral as well as cellular immune responsesand confer complete protection against anthrax and plague in multiple animal models including mice, rats,rabbits, and macaques. The T4 vaccines do not need an adjuvant as its surface structure mimics the Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) of viral pathogens and stimulate strong innate and adaptive immunity. The 120 x 86 nm phage T4 capsid is packaged with 171 kb genome and decorated with two non-essentialouter capsid proteins; 870 molecules of Soc (small outer capsid protein) and 155 copies of Hoc (highly antigenicouter capsid protein). In specific aim 1, a series of T4-corona phages will be constructed by incorporating SARS-CoV-2 virion components individually and in combinations, by CRISPR engineering. The gene encoding theentire spike ectodomain will be inserted into phage genome under the control of the strong CAG promoter. Uponimmunization, host cells (myocytes and antigen presenting cells at the site of immunization) take up phageparticles and secrete the ectodomain trimers continuously, stimulating the immune system for weeks to months.The gene for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein will be inserted such that the RBD will be expressedin host cells, as well as in E. coli as a Soc fusion protein which will then be displayed on phage capsid up to 870copies per capsid. The ectodomain of E protein will be fused to Hoc and displayed up to 155 copies per capsid.Finally, ~400 copies of N protein will be packaged inside the capsid as part of the scaffolding core. In specific aim 2, the above T4-corona recombinant phages will be evaluated for elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 virion-specific immune responses in a mouse model. Mice will be immunized with purified phage particlesintramuscularly and the immune responses will be quantified by ELISA, competitive receptor binding, ELISpot,and virus neutralization assays. We expect that the T4-corona vaccines will elicit robust antibody and cellularresponses and also inform which candidate(s) will be most effective in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have streamlined the CRISPR engineering such that the proposed T4 vaccines can be constructed inabout 4 weeks and the animal testing can be completed in about 12 weeks. The candidate vaccines will then beavailable for clinical trials and vaccine manufacture. The T4 vaccine will be exceedingly easy to manufacture,scale, and distribute globally, and could potentially lead to a breakthrough to avert the coronavirus crisis.","1, 7","1e, 7a, 7i"
C01173,Risk Sharing Mechanisms To Mitigate The Financial Consequences Of Pandemic Risk: Economic And Social Insurance Solutions For The UK,"The pandemic is causing business interruption (BI) across UK businesses, resulting in unprecedently widespread and global economic losses that are too large to be absorbed in full by the insurance industry. Yet, businesses are unlikely to obtain credit for trading without access to adequate BI insurance. As the government steps in to protect businesses, the burden for taxpayers is rising exponentially. This study will develop a novel risk-sharing mechanism to effectively share pandemic BI risk between UK businesses, insurers and government.  We will conduct action research; a method where we work with partners to define the problem, act upon it, and embed actions in future learning. We have partnerships agreed with UK business, insurance industry and government stakeholders to develop a BI risk-sharing mechanism. We will evaluate and build upon short-term post-lockdown products being generated by insurers and develop new solutions with this full range of stakeholders. This will enable delivery of a sustainable longer-term governance and funding solution for supporting UK business against interruption from current and future pandemic. Our research team is perfectly equipped as we have studied risk-sharing mechanisms globally for catastrophic disasters, with our results influencing policy and practice. Our research process and policy recommendations will (i) segment pandemic BI risk into core (must-have) and additional (good-to-have) cover elements; (ii)  identify who (business, insurance, or Government) should take which elements; (iii) propose a public-private governance and funding solution that combines different strategic responses to sharing BI risk elements across UK businesses, insurance industry and government stakeholders.",10,10c
P23500,INNOVATIVE NASAL VACCINES TO PREVENT PATHOGEN COLONIZATION AND INFECTION IN THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT,"Bacterial and viral respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for diseases with major public health impact: community-acquired pneumonia, whooping cough, influenza and COVID-19, respectively. Vaccines against some of these diseases, administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, do not prevent colonization or infection of the upper respiratory tract (URT), and therefore have limited impact on pathogen transmission.  The NOSEVAC consortium aims to develop and assess innovative nasal vaccine platforms as a novel concept to block the earliest stage of infection, thereby inhibiting URT colonisation, transmission and disease. The project builds on a unique consortium of 12 renowned and complementary teams from the EU, UK and Switzerland.  NOSEVAC'Äôs objectives are to:  'Ä¢ Develop vaccine formulations for nasal delivery of RNA- and protein-based antigens  'Ä¢ Discover bacterial antigens that promote colonization of the URT  'Ä¢ Use a combination of in vitro and in vivo models for optimal evaluation of vaccines efficacy  'Ä¢ Identify key host immune factors required for long-term protection of the URT in human   'Ä¢ Deliver two nasal vaccine candidates to fight S. pneumoniae and B. pertussis infection, and a single bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza and COVID-19  'Ä¢ Address acceptability of nasal vaccination  Expected outcomes include (1) strengthening innovation in Europe by enriching the pipeline for novel vaccines against (new) respiratory infections, (2) increasing knowledge on the mechanisms underlying URT colonization, infection and immunity, and (3) evaluating nasal vaccine acceptability by stakeholders. NOSEVAC will develop strategic research avenues to fight respiratory pathogens including those with epidemic potential and will facilitate evidence-based decision making to policy makers and investors.",7,7a
P22599,Adjuvant strategies for universal and multiseasonal influenza vaccine candidates in the context of pre-existing immunity,"Project Summary/Abstract  The burden of influenza remains high, with seasonal epidemics resulting in 3-5 million cases of severe illness  globally and ~650,000 fatalities/year. While immunity to influenza virus acquired through natural infection is  relatively broad and long-lived, immune responses induced through vaccination with current vaccines are short-  lived and narrow, requiring annual reformulation and revaccination. It is unclear what causes such dissimilarities  between infection- and vaccine-induced immunity, however major differences include route of exposure  (respiratory vs. parenteral), antigen type (live vs. inactivated virus/protein), and the robust activation of viral-  specific innate immune responses during infection. Current influenza vaccines elicit immune responses primarily  directed towards epitopes in the highly variable immunodominant head domain of the viral hemagglutinin (HA).  While antibodies directed towards the more conserved HA stalk domain provide cross-strain protection, this  domain is poorly immunogenic. HA head dominance compounded with the rapid pace of antigenic drift severely  limits cross-protection. Broad-based cellular immunity and mucosal immunity are also key to heterosubtypic  protection, however current parenteral vaccines do not induce these sufficiently. Thus, development of more  effective adjuvants and vaccination strategies targeting the mucosal route are clearly needed. Natural infection  with influenza virus stimulates strong adaptive immune responses through activation of Toll-, RIG-I-, and NOD-  like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting  adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we will employ a rationally designed  intranasal combination adjuvant to activate all three pathways through the mucosal route to more closely mimic  natural infection, which we hypothesize will lead to more robust and durable vaccine responses. This adjuvant  consists of a nanoemulsion adjuvant (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 and an RNA agonist of RIG-I derived  from the defective interfering RNA of Sendai virus (IVT). NE/IVT induces synergistic immune responses against  a variety of viral antigens, with magnified TH1-biased cellular immunity and mucosal immune responses. Here,  we will compare this adjuvant to two adjuvants licensed for parenteral vaccination with influenza vaccines (AS03  and MF59) to improve immune responses to two different antigen systems that have broadened heterosubtypic  protection in preclinical and clinical settings: (1) a sequential regimen utilizing split viruses containing chimeric  HAs with different Ã¢Â€ÂœexoticÃ¢Â€Â avian HA head domains all with the same stalk domain to guide immune responses  to epitopes in the stalk, and (2) a recombinant tetrameric neuraminidase. Human immune responses to influenza  vaccines are heavily influenced by pre-existing immunity acquired through past infections and/or immunizations.  We will further determine whether the immune responses driven by mucosal administration of NE/IVT with these  antigen systems can better take advantage of such pre-existing immune responses compared to parenteral  vaccination with AS03 by redirecting memory responses to more conserved epitopes.","1, 7","1d, 7a, 7i, 7l"

P25333,Evaluating a brief novel treatment for COVID-related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the Health and Social Care workforce: a pre-RCT preparatory study,"Background High levels of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are reported in frontline health and social care workers (HSCW) who have worked through the pandemic. These levels of PTSD are comparable to those in military veterans who have been involved in warfare. Staff with PTSD present a patient safety risk due to high staff absences and mistakes. Currently the best treatment available for PTSD is lengthy, costly and 30% of people undertaking this treatment drop out before the end.  New PTSD treatments are therefore needed. In an ongoing study we are looking at one new treatment called Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) in 60 military veterans with PTSD. RTM treatment is much shorter, and therapists can be quickly trained. In our review of research that has taken place, six small studies show that it looks promising in removing symptoms of PTSD 12 months later.  Aims Our study aims to develop an RTM treatment route for health and social care workers with PTSD and to develop an understanding of what their employers consider to be important health benefits for their staff. Before we can proceed with the study in the NHS we need to understand three things better: 1) Do staff want to receive treatment and participate in research and how? 2) Can RTM training undertaken by veteran-charity therapists also be successfully taught to psychological therapists employed by the NHS? 3) What employer benefits are important to measure e.g. sickness-absence rates and/or mistakes made by staff while working.  Design & Methods The main purpose of the study will be to develop a funding application to undertake further research of RTM to determine whether it works, how it works and is it safe compared to similar treatment. We propose a 3-phase study. Phase 1 will recruit 24 individuals made up of NHS and social care workers and families, NHS occupational health/staff health support managers, senior managers and members of the public to meet in groups to discuss and answer the research questions. Staff PTSD treatment routes within the NHS will be developed. Phase 2 will train and assess four psychological therapists in delivering RTM. Phase 3 will deliver RTM to twelve health and social care workers with PTSD to see if they will start therapy and take part as research participants.    Patient and Public Involvement  Three frontline staff, two public contributors and seven other stakeholders informed the research design, the lay summary and will support the funded study.    Research outputs The results, together with those of the veteran trial and our review of previous research, will support a funding application in late 2022 to test whether RTM can be proven to be a successful treatment within the NHS.","4, 11","4c, 11f"

C03863,Preventing Opioid Overdose Mortality in the United States,"We are proposing an urgent competitive revision for our current grant (R01DA04686702) to study the impactof the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on syringe service programs (SSPs) throughout the UnitedStates (US). The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly proliferated and caused unprecedented disruption to health and health services in the US and has the potential to reverse recent reductions in the nation's opioidoverdose mortality rate. As cities, counties, and states tried to stunt the transmission and impact of COVID-19, they began rolling out various social distancing orders (e.g., Shelter-in-Place). A consequence of these public health mandates and the need to protect people from COVID-19 has been disruptions in services forpeople who inject drugs (PWID). Particularly in the context of the opioid epidemic, understanding how theCOVID-19 pandemic has affected services for people who use drugs is critical to know how to respondwithin the current pandemic and to be better prepared for future public health crises. SSPs have been themainstay for community-based prevention efforts for PWID and have pioneered efforts for implementingoverdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) and improving enrollment into medications for opioiduse disorder (MOUD) programs. SSPs are considered an ""essential service"" and have not been mandated tosuspend services during Shelter-in-Place orders. As part of our nationwide study of SSPs, our study teamhas documented that SSPs are facing unprecedented challenges and adapting implementations, asnecessary. Leveraging our ongoing study, we propose to build a comprehensive understanding ofadaptations made in response to COVID-19. Using the exploration, preparation, implementation, andsustainment (EPIS) framework, we propose to systematically assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemicon SSP services in the US. Our proposed aims are as follows: Aim 1: To characterize the response toCOVID-19 regarding the delivery of syringe services, overdose education and naloxone distribution, andmedications for opioid use disorder among SSPs; Aim 2: To describe barriers and facilitators among SSPsregarding implementation of syringe services, overdose education and naloxone distribution, andmedications for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve these aims, we will conducta cross-sectional study with all SSPs (N = 407) in the US in late summer/fall 2020. In addition, we willconduct in-depth interviews with 36 SSPs from geographically diverse urban, suburban, and rural locationswhere we observe varying levels of implementation experiences-de-implementation of services, adaptedimplementations, and implementation as usual-during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how theCOVID-19 pandemic has impacted services for PWID is critical for improving our response within the currentpandemic and being better prepared for future pandemics.","9, 10","9a, 10a"
P22000,The biochemical mechanism and pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases,"Project Summary / Abstract  The objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying the exquisite  substrate binding and catalytic specificity of two phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K, PIKfyve).  The PIPK family of lipid kinases include PIP5K (type 1), PIP4K (type 2) and PIKfyve (type 3), and is primarily  responsible for converting phosphatidylinositol monophosphate lipids into PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,5)P2. Despite  sequence homology, these kinases are highly selective in substrate binding [PIP5K binds PI(4)P, PIP4K binds  PI(5)P, and PIKfyve binds PI(3)P] and in catalytic activity [PIP5K and PIKfyve phosphorylate the C5 hydroxyl of  the lipid's inositol head group, whereas PIP4K phosphorylates the C4 hydroxyl]. We and others have  previously identified two structural elements within the kinase domain, the specificity loop and a conserved  PIP-binding motif, that contribute to substrate selectivity, but how these two elements cooperate to confer  kinase specificity remains undefined at the structural level. In aim 1, we plan crosslinking strategies to stabilize  the specificity loop to facilitate co-crystallization with lipid substrates. We also plan to generate and crystallize a  minimalistic catalytic core domain of PIKfyve. In aim 2, we propose genetic and chemical biological  experiments to examine the role of PIKfyve in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Several large-scale drug  repurposing programs have identified apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor, as a top lead in suppressing SARS-CoV-2  replication in cell culture (a phase II clinical trial of apilimod in treating COVID-19 is ongoing at the Yale Center  for Clinical Investigation). This discovery, together with earlier observations that apilimod also reduces infection  by Ebola and Marburg viruses, has generated great interest in pharmacologically targeting PIKfyve. Drawing  on structural and biochemical knowledge about the lipid kinase family, as well as chemical tools previously  developed to target PIP4K, we have discovered a new class of potent PIKfyve inhibitors and plan to use them  together with apilimod to interrogate how PIKfyve inhibition disrupts SARS-CoV-2 infection. All previously  known PIKfyve inhibitors are structurally related to apilimod, and their binding mode to the lipid kinase is  unknown. The new inhibitor class is significant because it not only adds confidence to the proposed  involvement of PIKfyve in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also has a known binding mode to PIPK, which should  facilitate future optimization by medicinal chemistry.",6,"6a, 6g"

C14324,GCRF_NF178 Mobile Arts for Peace (MAP) at home: online psychosocial support through the arts in Rwanda,"During COVID-19 lockdown the Rwandan government initiated strict measures to prevent movement outside the home. Restrictions due to the pandemic increased risks of gender-based violence, teenage pregnancy and school drop-out. Previous studies reported that 26.1% of the population were estimated to have symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (Munyandamutsa et al. 2009); whereas recent studies have reported similar prevalence (RMHS, 2018) and genocide survivor organizations have reported an increase in mental distress during the lockdown. Deteriorating economic conditions pose a significant risk to young people's mental health, which could be further entrenched should further waves of the pandemic occur. Specifically, within Rwanda, there are no current initiatives to provide psychosocial support at home (including referral systems for those in need of more specialist intervention) or building two-way communication and synergies between formal and informal education structures (i.e. schools and community-based groups) to enable learning and social networking during social distancing.  MAP at home examines the potential for providing mental health support and community engagement in Rwanda through interactive online platforms, participatory arts workshops, and communications between young people, educators, cultural artists and psychosocial workers across the five provinces of Rwanda: Rwamagana District (Eastern Province); Rubavu District (Western Province); Gicumbi District (Northern Province); Huye District (Southern Province); and Kicukiru District (Kigali Province). MAP at home will research the prevention of, response to and awareness of mental health and promotion of psychosocial well-being among youth, families, and community members through an innovative arts-based, culturally-informed approach, responsive to the needs of participants.  MAP at home will generate knowledge on how to reach, engage and equip young people and caregivers with tools for psychosocial wellbeing through the development of a psychosocial module, online and participatory workshops (subject to COVID-19 guidance and social distancing measures), and integration of psychosocial workers. MAP will partner with community-based mental health provider Uyisenga Ni Imanzi, research organisation Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace (IRDP), national cultural organisation Rwanda Arts Council, and government mental health providers Rwanda Biomedical Centre/Mental Health Division and National Rehabilitation Services to coproduce the design, implementation and dissemination of research from a local to national level.

The project will respond to the following research questions in relation to COVID-19: *How can arts-based approaches be translated to online platforms to enhance psychosocial well-being? *What lessons can be learnt from the provision of online arts programmes for psychosocial well-being, especially regarding building resilience (individual and systemic) against future outbreaks or crises? *How might MAP at home advance digital innovation in the design and delivery of mental health provision and response services in Rwanda?",10,"10a, 10b"
C03795,"Epidemiology, transmission and immunology of COVID-19 in nursing home residents","During late 2019 and the first weeks of 2020 the suspected etiological agent of a large cluster o fpneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan was identified as a novel coronavirua. SARS-CoV-2 causesCOVID-19, and has erupted as a pandemic in a matter of months. As of 3/30/20 WHO states that there are729,100 confirmed cases globally and 34,689 deaths with the US now having the most cases. Currently novaccines or proven effective therapies exist, leaving transmission control measures to rely on draconianinfection control procedures. Exceptionally high rates of severe infection requiring hospitalization, intensivecare and respiratory support paired with unprecedented restriction of person-to-person contact has resulted inpreviously unseen global consequences on individuals' health, mortality, travel, quality of life and theeconomy. A report of, 72,314 cases in Wuhan resulted in an enormous case-fatality rate of 14.8% in thoseaged ≥80 years, 8.0% age 70-79 years, and 2.3% overall. COVID-19 has spread to 30 nursing homes (NH) in the Seattle area as of March 30th and over 150 NH nationally by March 23rd. The first 120-bed NH in Seattle had 81 COVID+ residents, resulting in 35 deaths atmortality rate of 29%. Importantly, at least 47 staff also developed symptoms or were COVID+. Thesemortality rates highlight the consequence of our current inability to detect infection and monitor transmissionin care facilities with a large number of staff that care for a high-density resident population that is the mostvulnerable to infection. There are over 15,000 NH in the US providing housing to over 1.4 million individuals.These NH residents are typically very elderly, frail, and have multimorbidities. Many millions more within the US share a similar clinical status but live in assisted living or at home where family care for them. The need to understand vulnerability, transmission and develop efficacious therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 in the NH resident is absolutely critical. One of the greatest challenges in an infectious disease outbreak is in determining which patients have mild forms of illness and may be quarantined in place and which patients have or may progress to severeforms of illness and require additional care or hospitalization in another facility. Furthermore, the early identification of those patients that will progress to severe forms of the disease needing further admission tothe ICU is crucial to increase their chances of survival.     Here we propose to conduct a surveillance and transmission study through which we will obtain samples that allow us to identify early biomarkers of COVID-19 disease severity or potential for disease severity, that could be used with clinical information to assistclinical decisions in a predictive fashion to stratify patients to the appropriate level of care.    Aim 1. Epidemiology: Determine the incidence and prevalence of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic COVID-19 in long-term care residents and the clinical course of their infection longitudinally.    Aim 2. Transmission: Assess frequency and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after an incident COVID+ resident is identified in the long-term care setting.    Aim 3. Immunobiology and Biomarkers: Use systems biology approaches to characterize and follow the virus:host interface and longitudinal host immune responses in COVID+ long-term care residents.     Our group has performed multiple NH-based studies in the last 5 years including a series of largecluster randomized studies, each over 800 NH nationally to a multisite vaccine RCT to epidemiologicscreening studies. We are perfectly positioned to obtain the samples and data we propose. In addition,specific to coronavirus we have added Dr. Mark Cameron (Co-PI at CWRU) who has substantial priorexperience with the SARS-CoV outbreak as a lead investigator during that outbreak in 2003 in Toronto.","1, 3, 4","1d, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b"
C06938,ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NETWORK: LATE PHASE CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES 6/9,"ABSTRACTDespite the high clinical significance, there is limited knowledge of the management and treatment of COVID-19. Patients with alcohol associated liver disease (ALD) and COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe disease,morbidity and mortality. There are also data that alcohol consumption increases during isolation, like that causedby social distancing measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore the incidence and severity ofALD is likely to increase. Current treatment approaches for patients with severe COVID-19 include antiviralagents and supportive care. In our preliminary and pilot studies we have observed sarcopenia or loss of skeletalmuscle mass and impaired muscle strength in patients with ALD. Sarcopenia and accompanying contractiledysfunction contribute to longer hospital and intensive care stay, greater need for ventilatory support and pooroutcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a hallmark of severe COVID-19. The ""cytokine storm""that occurs in patients with COVID-19 is accompanied by elevated circulating IL-6, and emerging data suggeststhat IL-6 inhibitors improve survival in patients with severe COVID-19. Despite the significant interest in IL-6inhibitors with multiple ongoing clinical trials underway, these agents increase the risk for secondary infections(a common occurrence in COVID-19) and are contraindicated in those with significant elevated plasmatransaminases. β-hydroxy β-methyl butyrate (HMB), a non-nitrogenous leucine metabolite with anabolicproperties, also inhibits plasma IL-6 while improving muscle mass and contractile function. We thereforehypothesize that COVID-19 worsens clinical outcomes and muscle loss in ALD patients, and that reversal ofmuscle loss by HMB through an IL-6 dependent manner will improve clinical outcomes in ALD patients. Thishypothesis will be tested through two interrelated, but independent specific aims: (1) establish the naturalcourse of COVID-19 infection in patients with ALD by determining whether COVID-19 is more severe inALD and whether COVID-19 worsens liver injury in ALD; (2) determine whether treatment with HMBimproves the acute and long-term consequences of COVID-19 in terms of skeletal muscle mass, skeletalmuscle function, and clinical outcomes in ALD patients. We will use clinical and biosamples to determineoutcomes and responses to intervention targeting the skeletal muscle in these patients. We anticipate HMB willreduce inflammatory markers including circulating IL-6, improve clinical outcomes in-hospital, reversesarcopenia, and improve long-term clinical outcomes. These human studies have the potential for immediatetranslation into clinical practice to rapidly improve immediate and long-term outcomes in ALD patients withCOVID-19. These studies will supplement the applicant's ongoing alcoholic hepatitis network grant supportedby the NIAAA.",4,"4a, 4b, 4c"

P21252,"US-UK Collab: Heterogeneities, Diversity and the Evolution of Infectious Disease","The aim of this project is to understand the effect of disease severity on the spread and evolution of infectious diseases, and its significance for infectious disease management and control. Recent and current epidemics emphasize that there is a pressing need to understand what makes some infectious diseases so devastating. Pathogens from the common cold through seasonal flu, SARS-1, SARS-2, and Ebola vary remarkably in how deadly they are and how well they transmit between people. Moreover, there is considerable variation in the impact that a specific disease will have on different individuals in a population. For example, some individuals get sicker than others, and importantly some will act as superspreaders of the pathogen. This type of variation is typical of infectious diseases in humans and other species, including livestock, crops and wildlife. To answer these questions the researchers will combine mathematical and computational models to develop new evolutionary theory that will explain the important factors responsible for variation in the outcome of an infection. The findings from the theory will be tested experimentally using an insect disease system in the laboratories at UC Berkeley. The mathematical modelling and experimental analysis can then be applied to real systems. A particular focus will be to examine the impact of different agricultural management practice on the severity of disease in agricultural systems, for example, which farming practices lead to the evolution of more virulent disease. Understanding what determines the virulence of infectious disease is critical to the effective management of current and emerging disease threats.<br/><br/>Individual hosts vary in their susceptibility and transmissibility through genetic and epigenetic effects, their condition, and their immune memory. Individual hosts also vary in their disease contacts within a population due to how individuals are arranged in space, how they move, and how they interact, all of which can generate population structure even in the absence of heterogeneities in the environment. These individual heterogeneities and the heterogeneity in transmission due to population structure can interact with heterogeneities that arise from specific interactons between host and parasites genotype. This project will test theories about the effects each of these three sources of heterogeneity (individual, population and interaction) have on the epidemiology of disease. How these different heterogeneities interact to determine the evolution of disease virulence and host defense is little studied. New theory is therefore required to test these interactions? implications to both long-term evolutionary outcomes and short-term transient dynamics. This project will: (1) develop theory to predict how these heterogeneities interact to determine long-term outcomes and transient evolutionary behavior, (2) test these predictions in a tractable laboratory model system (larvae of the moth Plodia interpunctella infected with PiGV), and (3) develop models to predict the impact of heterogeneities on the evolution of pathogens in agricultural systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","1, 3","1c, 1e, 3a"
C09384,Primary care research on outcomes of COVID-19 (PRO-COVID-19),"Project description  Many research initiatives have emerged since the global spread of COVID-19; these take place almost exclusively in secondary care institutions. In the Netherlands, however, most patients initially contact their GP. Well-organized primary care, including Corona specialist GPs, can optimize referral to emergency care, reduce pressure on hospital capacity and provide adequate follow-up for COVID-19 patients. The acute assessment of COVID-19 patients in general practice is challenging. Furthermore, the long-term impact of COVID-19 patients, both somatic and psychological, within primary care is unknown.    Research  This study aims to study the effects of two research questions, related to the visit of COVID-19 suspected patients to the GP / GP Coronapost:    What clinical signs and symptoms from the medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests predict COVID-19-related hospital admissions within 2 weeks?  What are the long-term consequences of more serious COVID-19 infections (complicated respiratory tract infections) in patients who have attended the general practice?",4,"4a, 4b, 4d"
C07033,Cognitive Control in Children of SUD Parents:  A Longitudinal Multimodal MRI Study (2),"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, both economic and racial/ethnic disparities have been dramaticallyon display, with life and death consequences. COVID-19 serves as a deadly wake-up call regarding the needto better understand how existing social, economic and health disparities are compounded in their consequenceson disadvantaged communities in the wake of disaster, in this case, a deadly pandemic. If we are to developimproved preparations for responding to future epidemics, it is especially important to understand how COVID-19 is affecting substance use (SU) and mental health (MH) across different racial/ethnic communities. Therefore,this Stress and COVID-19 (S&C) Study is designed to address such questions by expanding an ongoing study,which immediately entered the field and is recruiting a random selection of participants from four ongoing,longitudinal epidemiologic studies examining the impact of different types of trauma and stress in the York Citymetropolitan area, epicenter of COVID-19. Taken together, these studies encompass a broad range of SES andracial/ethnic diversity (49% minority; 51% white), with the participants thoroughly characterized in multiple wavesof data during key stressors, traumas, as well as thorough diagnostic assessments of SU and MH. The first waveof the proposed S&C Study, which was initiated in mid-March 2020 to capture early indicators, is interviewing,via telephone, a random selection (n=1,000) of participants drawn from four ongoing studies (N=6,178) includingthe Parent Grant study which is focused on a (98%) minority population, and assessing the multifaceted impactsthat COVID is CURRENTLY having, especially on SU and MH behaviors, expecting a sample of N=800.This Supplement is requested to support the follow-up phase, which will consist of two additional waves of datacollection, at six and nine months after the conclusion of the first wave (months 1-3) and analysis of all waves ofdata. This Supplement will allow for a longitudinal trajectory analysis of the COVID-19 impact on SU and MHoutcomes. Importantly, this S&C Study design also allows for the utilization of 2-4 waves of detailed pre-COVID-19 data on each subject, including SU and MH behaviors and diagnoses, and a wide range of important riskfactors for post-COVID outcomes. Thus, this Supplement will support the investigation of which factors predictCOVID-driven trajectories of SU and MH outcomes, as well as other COVID-driven life changes. The cohortsbeing combined for this study were originally chosen for their unique exposures to different forms of childhoodtrauma: including disaster (9/11), parental involvement with the criminal justice system and parental SUD., Thus,this proposed study will help us determine how prior trauma impacts subsequent COVID-19 behaviors, especiallySU and MH across different exposures and across disparate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Takentogether, the design features of this proposed study represent a unique opportunity to examine how pre-existingand current disparities are contributing to COVID-19 outcome disparities in SU and MH burden.",10,"10a, 10b"
C19843,The indirect impact of COVID-19 on cardiac function and associated outcomes in patients awaiting cardiac surgery: An opportunity to inform data-driven surgical wait list management,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-urgent surgeries, including many heart surgeries, were delayed to free up hospital staff and space to care for patients with COVID-19. However, waiting for heart surgery can cause permanent damage to the heart, which may impact a patient's long-term health and survival. We do not know the impact of pandemic-related delays in heart surgery on a person's heart function or longer-term health. We also do not know whether some people are especially at risk of deteriorating while waiting for heart surgery. Even before the pandemic, some groups of patients, such as women or people from poorer neighbourhoods, had long wait times for heart surgery, leading to poorer health after surgery. The pandemic may have made this trend even worse. Together, this information will be important in understanding which patients on the heart surgery waiting list should be prioritized. We will study the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart surgery patients at 2 hospitals in Ontario. Specifically, we will examine heart function and long-term health in 8,000 patients waiting for heart surgery in the 2 years before and the 2 years during the pandemic. Our first goal is to examine the effect of the pandemic on wait times, heart function, and long-term health in heart surgery patients. Our second goal is to identify factors (e.g., sex, income level, surgery wait time) that predict which patients will experience a decline in heart function and poor long-term health as a result of waiting for heart surgery. Because it will take many years to clear the backlog of heart surgeries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand whose heart function is most likely to decline while they are on the surgery wait list. These patients should be prioritized for surgery to prevent poor long-term health. This approach could lead to better and fairer wait list policies both during and after the pandemic.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
P22874,Identification of a novel zinc acquisition system in Yersinia pestis,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of human plague. Every year, approximately 2,000 cases of human plague  occur, and in the past, several pandemics of plague have caused wide spread population loss. Y. pestis poses  a threat to modern society due to its potential to be used as a bioterrorism agent, the absence of a FDA approved  vaccine, and the possibility of antibiotic resistance. The identification of novel targets for therapeutic agents is  critical for public health and safety. Consequently, Y. pestis is considered a Tier 1 Select Agent. For survival and  virulence, Y. pestis must acquire transition metals, such as Fe, Zn, and Mn and overcome nutritional immunity,  mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms that restrict nutrients from invading bacteria. During human plague,  Yersinia pestis is able to overcome Fe limitation via production of the siderophore Yersiniabactin (Ybt). Recently,  we identified an unexpected role for the Ybt system in the ability of Y. pestis to acquire Zn during infection. While  the ZnuABC system contributes to in vitro growth in Zn-deficient media, a znu mutant is not attenuated in the  mouse model of plague, unless the mutant also lacks genes involved in Ybt synthesis. These data suggest that  Y. pestis uses two redundant Zn acquisition systems to cause plague. We hypothesize that Y. pestis produces  a novel Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore required for zinc acquisition and virulence. In Specific Aim 1, we  will use a novel Tn-seq method to define genetic elements involved in the zincophore system. Genes that show  a Zn phenotype will be validated through growth assays, trans-complementation, and biochemical experiments.  In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of the Ybt synthetase-dependent zinc acquisition system to  virulence by utilizing a hemochromatosis mouse model. The hemochromatosis mouse is defective in Fe  nutritional immunity, which will allow us to distinguish between the contributions of Ybt synthetase-dependent Fe  acquisition and Ybt synthetase-dependent Zn acquisition to Y. pestis virulence. In Specific Aim 3, we will  determine the impact of calprotectin on Y. pestis virulence by using in vitro and in vivo methods. Completion of  these Aims will define a novel secreted Zn acquisition system in Y. pestis. Our studies will be the first to determine  the contribution of Zn acquisition to Y. pestis virulence in the mammalian host and the effect of calprotectin on  plague infection. Furthermore, the involvement of conserved Ybt in this novel Zn acquisition demonstrates the  significance of these studies to other bacterial pathogens.","1, 4, 6","1b, 1c, 4b, 6a"
C09985,Adapting offices to support COVID-19 secure workplaces and emerging work patterns,"COVID-19 changed where we work - 2019 5% of UK workforce worked mainly from home, reaching 44% in May 2020, remaining at 27% in July 2020 when restrictions eased (ONS, 2020). This multidisciplinary project supports economic recovery via identifying effective office design and adaptation of work practices to maximise gains and minimise downsides from remote and hybrid working. Homeworking offers flexibility and work-life balance, but most products and services result from collaboration and discussion (Elliot & Deasley, 2007) - work completion and performance are inherently social processes. Organizations must design offices, technologies and working practices that facilitate this social fabric. We apply a socio-technical approach to 1) establish exemplars for design and operation of offices adaptable to COVID-19 constraints, remote and hybrid working; 2) investigate how different office and work arrangements (e.g., hybrid working) impact social networks, workflow and performance by studying employees' in adapted offices (via interviews, high-frequency diary study, social network analysis, building data); 3) offer recommendations for supporting the transition of workers back into offices; 4) an evidence base to guide office requirement planning.

C06882,Investigating Effect of Air pollution and Host Defenses in SARS-CoV2 infection,"It is estimated that while the majority of SARS-CoV2 infections in the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19) pandemic are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, hospitalizations and mortality largelyoccurs in patients with co-morbid conditions such as obesity, diabetes and COPD. Our understanding ofthe role of environmental exposures in modifying the response to SARS-CoV2 is emerging and airpollution; smoking and vaping have been associated with worst outcomes of SARS-CoV2 patients. There isa time sensitive urgent need to understand host defense mechanisms which are compromised due toenvironmental exposures and may increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection. This competing revisionwill forge collaboration with expert in SARS-CoV2 research to expand our horizon in this critical area. Wewill test the hypothesis of targeting a host defense pathway which is compromised in air pollution that mayprotect and modify the response to SARS-COV2 respiratory infection. Through the parent U grant, we havedemonstrated that chronic exposure to PM2.5 has an overarching role in epigenetic reprogramming. Ourstudies have established that transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid-factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key activator ofanti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and innate immune defenses. We and others have demonstrated inhuman biospecimens and animal models that chronic exposure to PM2.5 causes a decline in Nrf2 activitythat correlates with compromised innate immune defenses. In mice deficient for Nrf2 (Nrf2-/-), viral andbacterial infection causes oxidative stress, worsened lung inflammation, acute lung injury and greatermortality compared to wildtype mice. Genetic or pharmacological activation of Nrf2 pathway can rescuethese effects. Disruption of Nrf2 pathway has been shown to cause upregulation of angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (ACE2) which is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 entry into lung epithelial cells.Furthermore, hypomethylation in ACE2 gene has been demonstrated to increase ACE2 expression inimmunocompromised patients. The goal for this project is to investigate the crosstalk of air pollutionexposure, host defense and SARS-CoV2 infection. Preclinical testing of therapeutic efficacy of Nrf2activators will provide proof of concept for further development a novel drug target for prevention andtreatment of SARS-COV2 infection. The proposal will leverage expertise of our team on air pollution,respiratory diseases and an expert virologist with ongoing BSL-3 SARS-CoV2 research. Successfulcompletion of this project will provide proof of concept for future studies directed towards development of anovel strategy of targeting host defense for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection insusceptible populations.",1,"1b, 1f"

COVID-19 has led to enormous changes in the provision of NHS care. All non-urgent operations have been cancelled and a third of hospital beds converted for use by COVID-19 patients. A&E attendances dropped by 50% in the past month. This will have major impacts on care received by non-COVID-19 patients and their outcomes during and after the outbreak. However, who is affected and how this is likely to impact future health outcomes is currently unknown. We will quantify the reduction in NHS care, and examine its distribution by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and geography. We will analyse the latest information from Understanding Society and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to document disruptions to primary, hospital and community care across England, Scotland and Wales. This will complement analysis of real-time patient records from a large London hospital trust that builds a rich picture of disruptions to hospital care and changes in patient outcomes. This will provide detailed, timely and important evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on care provided to other patients.

C03161,Palliative Care for People who use Substances During Communicable Disease Epidemics and Pandemics: A Scoping Review,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its response efforts magnify the health care challenges encountered by people who use substances. People who use substances are at high risk of life-limiting illnesses such as end-stage organ failure and cancer. Unfortunately, people who use substances encounter barriers to receiving palliative care. People who use substances often have few social supports and lack financial resources. Moreover, delivery of community-based health services may be restricted due to institution and provider concerns that the settings are risky or unsafe. Zero-tolerance policies toward non-medical use of substances also restrict access to palliative care units and hospices. Given these pre-existing inequities to palliative care access and increased demand for palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand the impact of COVID-19 on people with life-limiting illnesses who use substances.   To address this critical issue, we propose a scoping review that will identify knowledge strengths and gaps about palliative care for people with life-limiting illnesses who use substances during communicable disease epidemics and pandemics. Our project will critically assess the state of knowledge and provide decision support for healthcare providers and policy makers during COVID-19 and future communicable disease epidemics and pandemics. Through our dedicated knowledge translation strategy, we will ensure timely dissemination of our findings to patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and decision makers. Our project is aligned with a key goal in the Government of Canada's five-year action plan for palliative care (2019 - 2024), which seeks to to improve access to palliative care for underserved populations who experience difficulties in obtaining health care and to improve the quality of care when it is received.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
C00822,Identifying host factors as drug targets and drugs employing RNAi knockdown screens,"Abstract: We aim to identify and effectively inhibit host dependency factors being essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread, following a systematic screening approach. Human epithelial cells will be seeded in ""ready to transfect"" multiwell plates, designed and produced in the laboratory of HE. Those plates are containing dried siRNA/transfection reagent complexes. When the cells attach to the surface, reverse transfection enables siRNA mediated knockdown of a single gene, in high-throughput. Then, the cells will be infected with clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected by SC and cCytopathic effect and MTT assays performed. After inactivation by paraformaldehyde, these transportable plates will be sent to the lab of HE who will elaborately phenotype the cells using an established imaging pipeline. RK will compare the hits from the screen to time-lapse proteomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infected human epithelial host cells (data was derived from SC recently), omics data from other coronavirus infection studies, and gene associations to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This will lead to a short list of host dependency factors for which drugs will be selected employing publicly available drug databases. Selected host factors and drugs will be validated in the lab of SC employing a broad selection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In addition, RK will infer a SARS-CoV-2 specific protein interaction network and identify clusters of host factors to get drug combinations, which will be experimentally validated by SC.

C00873,The Role of Group 3 Innate Lymphoid cells (ILC3) in Tuberculosis,"Over the past three months, COVID-19 has emerged as a major pandemic with over ~ 1.9 million productiveinfections and ~100,000 deaths due to infection with the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a viral pathogenwhich is highly infectious and pathogenic. This is particularly true in the elderly and people withimmunocompromising conditions who are exhibiting acute respiratory distress syndrome at a greaterfrequency. Unfortunately, no known cures and vaccines exist. Worse, there were no well-characterized animalmodels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease till recently. With the limited information on hostinnate immune responses, early reports implicate a role for inflammation in mediating COVID-19 disease. Asan logical extension of ongoing work on innate immune responses in the lung on the parent grant, wehypothesize that similar to tuberculosis (TB), control of SARS-CoV2 will correlate with accumulation of innatelymphoid cells including NK cells in the lung, while inflammation and increased disease will be associated withmyeloid cell accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize recently acquired banked lung samples from anovel rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease developed at the SouthWestNational Primate Research Center (in collaboration with Deepak Kaushal Lab, Co-I on parent grant). Thesenew results from the NHP model indicate that rhesus macaques develop signs of human COVID-19 diseaseincluding pyrexia, dysregulation of complete blood cell counts indicative of viral infection, acute stress markers,and experience cough and weight-loss. This is accompanied by high viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) and lungs, and pneumonia is detected by CT scan as well as grossly at necropsy. Single cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq) is just beginning to be applied to the immune system in animal models and humansin both healthy and diseased states. The application of scRNA-seq to COVID-19 samples from macaques isparticularly well-suited, as the immune cells infiltrating the lung that may play roles in the disease are diverse,including virtually all types of lymphocytes (ILCs, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, NK cells, B cells) andseveral myeloid cell types (monocytes, macrophages and potentially dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils(PMNs)). Within each of these subtypes, further heterogeneity exists in terms of cytokine production andtranscription factor expression, such that each subtype may demonstrate further heterogeneity. BecausescRNA-seq can define the transcriptomic heterogeneity of a complex community of cells and assign unbiasedidentity classifications to cell populations, it is optimally suited for application to the study of complexinflammatory disease such as TB and COVID-19. The data obtained and its computational analysis willdelineate the nature of inflammation, especially the role of innate cells such as NK cells and ILCs in COVID-19mediated inflammation. These studies will create new opportunities for identifying therapeutic targets forcontrol of pan-epidemics such as TB and COVID-19.",1,"1b, 1d"

Currently, COVID-19is being diagnosed primarily by three techniques, i.e. reverse-transcription polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR), gene sequencing and chest computed tomography (CT). However, limitationsof sample collection and transportation, as well as kit performance with inadequate access toadvanced instrumental techniques, often cannot report COVID-19 at its initial presentation leadingto the spread of this infectious disease to a wider community. Moreover, researchers found at leastthree central variants, distinguishable by amino acid changes, among 160 different complete humanSARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. This limits the universal applicability of the currently availablecommercial COVID-19 kits. In this proposal we present a novel approach for screening of activeCOVID-19 cases with a paper based lateral flow assay mediated colorimetric POC biosensor thatwould be able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence using specifically designed antisenseoligonucleotides (ASO). This unique approach for selective sensing of SARS-CoV-2 eliminates thepossibility of misinterpretation arisen due to the genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 which is the mostconcerning limitation of the current COVID-19 sensing kits.",1,"1a, 1c"
P21985,Establishment of the New York University Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (NYU VTEU),"PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishment of New York University (NYU) Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) is proposed in  response to RFA-AI-18-046 entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœVaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) (UM1 Clinical Trial  Required)Ã¢Â€Â. NYU VTEU will be one of the 10 fixed sites that will participate in the NIAID Infectious Diseases  Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). Within the consortium, this NYU VTEU will work closely with NIAID, the  Leadership Group (LG), other VTEUs, and NIAID-supported research resources.  The broad, long-term objective of NYU VTEU is to protect and restore human health through clinical trials of  innovative medical countermeasures to combat microbial threats. While major advances in vaccines and  antimicrobial agents have resulted in large reductions in morbidity and mortality, emerging and re-emerging viral  threats (e.g., Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS, Nipah, dengue) and widespread antimicrobial drug resistance threaten  to reverse these gains. Furthermore, we remain without broadly effective vaccines against the major infectious  disease killers: tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS. A better seasonal influenza vaccine and ultimately a universal  influenza vaccine are needed, as evidenced by 80,000 US flu deaths during the 2017-18 season. Working with  NIAID and LG, NYU VTEU will review, refine and implement the infectious diseases clinical research agenda.  As per RFA-AI-18-046, the initial IDCRC priority research areas include: sexually transmitted infections (STIs),  malaria and neglected tropical diseases, respiratory infections, enteric diseases, and emerging infections. The  medical countermeasures to be studied include: vaccines, biologics, therapeutics, biomarkers with predictive  value, devices, and diagnostics.  NYU VTEU team has extensive expertise and experience with these priority infectious diseases and  countermeasures. When high priority pathogens need to be addressed quickly, NYU VTEU has demonstrated  experience in rapid responsiveness and surge capacity - critical elements of the optimal VTEU. Importantly, in  order to speed the development of needed vaccines, an inpatient research unit for controlled human infection  model (CHIM) studies has been developed at NYU VTEU. NYU School of Medicine comprises seven major  hospitals. The diverse patients cared for in these hospitals and associated clinics (8.4 million outpatient visits  and 144,000 inpatient admissions in 2018), along with the large diverse NYC population of 8.6 million (largest  city in US), are ideal for recruitment of patients with specific conditions and healthy individuals.","7, 11","7g, 7j, 7z, 11c"
P22213,Global effects of flavivirus sfRNA on translation determined by ribosome profiling,"Flaviviruses include many serious pathogens such as Zika, dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses. In infected cells these viruses produce abundant, noncoding, short flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) that comprise most of the ~500 nucleotide 3Ã¢Â€Â™ untranslated region of the viral genome. These novel viral RNAs have been shown recently to interact with numerous host proteins and inhibit translation (protein synthesis) of certain genes of the innate immune system. Thus, virus strains that produce high levels of sfRNA are more pathogenic, and mutants that produce no sfRNA are so mild as to be promising vaccine candidates. However, a picture of how sfRNA globally affects translation of cellular mRNAs is lacking. The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic of 2014-16 resulted in frighteningly frequent cases of microcephaly and other developmental and neurological disorders caused by exposure to ZIKV in utero. In addition to inhibiting the immune response, ZIKV sfRNA inhibits Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a key translational regulator of neurological development. Thus, this knowledge of the global effects of ZIKV sfRNA on host translation could contribute to future research on understanding how this virus manipulates the host and causes disease. Method: We will employ the transformative method of ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to sample the level of translation across the entire population of mRNAs in the cell in order to identify genes that are translationally up- or down-regulated in the presence of sfRNA, either alone, or in the context of replicating ZIKV. RiboSeq - a modification of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) - reveals only the fragments of mRNAs that are protected by translating ribosomes. The number of reads of ribosome-protected fragments from a given mRNA is proportional to how actively that mRNA is translated. This highly informative method has been applied only sparingly to flaviviruses and, to our knowledge, never to determine specifically the effects of sfRNA, a known translational regulator. We will also develop new statistical methods to improve on current imperfect approaches for calculating significance of changes in translational efficiency of mRNAs in response to a treatment. Finally, we will use a variety of bioinformatics tools to identify common structural features of mRNAs whose translation efficiencies are similarly affected by sfRNA. Expected Outcomes. Identification of genes whose translation is affected by sfRNAs will reveal potential genes and genetic pathways that facilitate - or defend against Ã¢Â€Â"" ZIKV infection. These can be the focus of future studies by us and others to determine their role and regulation in virus infection, the immune response, or possibly neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, these results may reveal new ways of regulating translation. This research can benefit human health by informing rational design of vaccines or antivirals targeting ZIKV and other flaviviruses, and by providing better understanding of control of protein synthesis by RNA.",1,"1b, 1c"
C00153,"Serological studies to quantify SARS-CoV-2 population infection risk in Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand","We propose a prospective serological study to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population in three Asian settings: Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand. The study will aim to measure the age-specific seroprevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 3 time points, each 6 months apart. Age-specific incidence estimates will be applied to the census population to obtain numbers of infections in the population at each time point. These estimates will be compared with external data on COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in each setting, to calculate age-specific infection-hospitalisation and infection-fatality ratios. SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics will be defined by studying changes in antibody titres over time. Risk factors for infection will be studied by comparing SARS-CoV-2 seroconverters and non-seroconverters with respect to epidemiological exposures. This study will provide crucial information regarding population exposure and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, and will provide a complete picture of the relationship between clinically apparent and asymptomatic infections.",3,"3a, 3b"
C19649,Engaging youth and families in designing a mental health service plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: A participatory action research study,"Youth are at risk of experiencing poor mental health due to the daily life changes associated with COVID-19 pandemic, and evidence from youth and parents reveals that this is the trend. Data suggest that the pandemic-related changes in youth mental health may lead to more youth accessing services in the future. Therefore, our healthcare system should be ready to meet the needs of youth. However, during the pandemic how, what and to whom services were delivered also changed, namely with the shift to online services. These changes were made quickly and did not involve any input from youth or their families. As society recovers from the pandemic, we need to figure out who to help, what help they need, and how best to offer services that benefit them. Involving youth and families in service planning is the best way to arrive at solutions most acceptable to youth and lead to mental health improvements.  In this study, youth and families will be equal members of the research team and will be fully involved in organizing focus groups to (1) Understand what the mental health service needs, preferences and experiences of youth and families are, and (2) Create information for how services can be improved to lead to better outcomes. We aim to include participants with various backgrounds and experiences to improve the diversity and applicability of our findings. This study will involve multiple phases, from determining the research questions to presenting the findings, all of which will be shaped by youth and families, to reflect their interests and needs.  What we learn from the focus groups will be used to create tools that can be used by youth and families, health providers, policy makers, and researchers to support the best possible service delivery and mental health outcomes during and after the pandemic. Relationships with mental health organizations will help us to share our findings more widely and promote long-standing changes to mental health care for youth.","9,10","9b, 10a"
C15153,Paper-COVID - Platform for High-throughput SARS-CoV-2 Screening and Contact Tracing,"Abstract  At present, most of the diagnostic testing for COVID-19 has been done through local sampling of those who are  symptomatic followed by centralized laboratory testing - returning results in 3-4 days. This is now supplemented  by several point-of-care (PoC) systems who can perform the same test on site, returning the result much quicker,  but at much lower throughput. To return many elements of the US economy to closer to normal function, such  as international air travel, large-scale employers, and campus-based institutes of higher learning, will require us  to shift from diagnostic testing to large scale, distributed, and repeated screening of asymptomatic (or pre-  symptomatic) individuals. The length of time-to-result for traditional centralized testing and the relatively low  throughput of existing PoC systems will make this a challenge.  Here we propose to develop Paper-COVID - a modular platform that combines a clinically validated LAMP assay  (already with FDA EUA approval) with a mobile phone based paper testing platform that enables much higher  throughput screening for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates automated contact tracing. The goal for this  effort is to validate a novel sample processing technique, port the previously developed LAMP assay to a paper-  based format, construct three modular prototype systems, and validate it on clinical samples from New York  City.",1,1a
C17849,Development of a Hampshire & Isle of Wight COVID-19 Testing Hub,"Through joint working between University Hospital Southampton NHS FT (UHS FT), the University of Southampton (UoS), local government and the wider NHS and social care, the aim of this proposal is to establish a sub-regional Hampshire & Isle of Wight (HIOW) COVID-19 testing and training hub as a pathfinder for a national program. The objective is to demonstrate how mass scale Direct RT-LAMP saliva testing can be operationalised in a sub-regional testing hub driven by the NHS in service delivery. Developing a model through collaborative partnership with both commercial and academic partners, the constant focus will be on the need to create an infrastructure that delivers to the sub-regional population, while being easily and rapidly scaled up across the country. As a demonstration site, the aim is to immediately commence testing 2,000 samples per day from the outset, ramping up to 100,000 samples per day over 2-3 months.","1, 11, 12","1a, 11a, 12c"
C15224,Identification of olfactory mucosa protein fingerprints in COVID-19,"PROJECT SUMMARY  A sudden onset of olfactory impairment is reported as one of the early clinical manifestations of COVID-19,  particularly among mild and asymptomatic patients. Though reports indicate that olfactory loss resolves within  two weeks, it is unknown what proportion of the patients develops persistent postinfectious olfactory  dysfunction due to lacking longitudinal studies. Olfactory neuroepithelium, located in the olfactory cleft region of  the nasal cavity, is venerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A known receptor to SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-  converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in the non-neuronal cell types but not olfactory sensory neurons in  the human olfactory epithelium. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the olfactory epithelium  produces an inflammatory microenvironment which in turn impacts on the function of olfactory sensory  neurons. Systematic proteomics analysis of the olfactory mucosa microenvironment will facilitate the  identification of COVID-19 induced inflammation and provide a better understanding of mechanisms in  olfactory loss and recovery. To determine olfactory mucosal proteomics, we will sample the olfactory cleft  region with nasal swab under the guidance of endoscopy and perform TMT-based quantitative mass  spectrometry analysis to compare COVID-19 positive anosmic/hyposmic with non-COVID-19 normosmic  subjects. We aim to 1. identify distinct protein fingerprints in Covid-19 olfactory mucosa; 2 perform longitudinal  analysis of olfactory mucosa proteomes to predict olfactory recovery. Data established through this study will  also help identify COVID-19 biomarkers, guide therapeutic strategies, and provide insight into the general  mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 triggered inflammation and its impact on neuronal functions.",4,4b
C07414,AERosolisation And Transmission Of SARS-CoV-2 in Healthcare Settings (AERATOR),"Aerosolisation of SARS-CoV-2 during clinical procedures is a major concern. The safe resumption of essential NHS services is impaired by the need to mitigate the theoretical risk of cross infection from procedural aerosolisation. This includes extensive preoperative planning, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout, and delays in patient/staff movement before, during, and after the procedure. There is currently little to no evidence on aerosolisation risk for many procedures, hampering national guidance and greatly reducing NHS capacity. The AERATOR study will address a critical gap in evidence by quantifying the concentration, size and temporal and spatial dynamics of aerosols produced during routine medical & surgical procedures in different environments. This will focus on five clinical specialties particularly impacted by procedural aerosolisation: dental, orthopaedic, respiratory, critical care and ophthalmology. This work comprises three workstreams: Workstream 1: Within the Bristol Aerosol Research Centre (BARC) we will rapidly (within 4 weeks) validate instruments to study aerosolisation in clinical settings. Workstream 2: Instruments will be moved into clinical settings and, using multiple instruments and sampling techniques, will measure aerosolisation dynamics and size across time and space. Workstream 3: By using novel equipment, only available within Bristol, to levitate virus within a CL3 laboratory, we will investigate the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol particles and determine its infectivity. The information gathered in this study will allow us to inform hospital trusts, policy makers and Public Health England regarding the safe and maximally efficient NHS working across multiple specialties.",5,5b
C06333,Activation of inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this platform in the pathogenesis of COVID-19: a prospective study aimed at inhibiting NLRP3 for the treatment of COVID-19,"COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide health problem, with more than one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths by the beginning of April 2020. In its most severe forms, COVID-19 manifests itself in the form of fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnoea, headache and may progress to respiratory distress syndrome and death. The most severe cases are characterized by an intense inflammatory process, with important recruitment of classically activated neutrophils and macrophages. There are also high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1², which is produced in a manner dependent on the inflammasome, a complex of intracellular proteins that promotes inflammatory processes. The presence of high concentrations of IL-1² in patients suggests an important participation of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Thus, we intend to evaluate the inflammasome activation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell cultures and in clinical material obtained from patients with COVID-19. We also intend to monitor inflammasoma activation in a prospective study with 60 patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 at HC-FMRP who will be treated with chloroquine in combination (or not) with colchicine, a drug widely used for the treatment of mediated diseases by NLRP3 inflammasome, as a gout. Colchicine prevents the formation of tubulin dimers, inhibiting several cellular processes, including the activation of the inflammasoma. Thus, the development of this research project should directly contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19, in addition to providing a mechanistic basis for the use of colchicine as a possible treatment for patients with COVID-19.","1, 4, 6","1d, 4b, 6l"

C19880,Understanding the effects of hospital capacity strain on quality of hospital care for patients admitted to medical and ICU wards during the pandemic and evaluating interventions to mitigate hospital capacity strain,"COVID-19 placed significant strain on hospital capacity in Canada. We will study the effect of this strain on the quality of acute care for adult medical and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, the two main locations of COVID-19 care and subsequent hospital strain. To mitigate capacity strain, Ontario hospitals engaged in inter-facility transfers of >3000 patients and extended ICU care onto medical wards. There is limited evidence about if these interventions were safe or effective for transferred patients or for critically ill patients cared for in a non-ICU setting. Little is known about how hospital strain, or the above interventions, impacted marginalized populations. Our research aims to investigate how hospital strain, and the two major capacity-mitigating interventions, affected quality of acute care for hospitalized medical and ICU patients. We will use data from GEMINI, a clinical and administrative data repository with data from 33 large hospitals across Ontario (~60% of Ontario's adult medical hospital beds), linked to population data at ICES. GEMINI is the largest clinical research dataset on hospitalized patients in Canada. First, we aim to characterize the effect of hospital strain on quality of care for medical and ICU patients. Then, we aim to investigate how large-scale inter-facility transfers and extension of ICU onto the ward affected clinical care. We will study prevalence and severity of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 hospitalizations, the impact on care for patients with chronic conditions, and the impact on marginalized groups (older adults, patients from marginalized neighborhoods). We will build a transfer optimization model that considers demographic, clinical and system factors to inform equitable and impactful inter-hospital patient transfers during future periods of hospital strain. Our results will help mitigate wider health consequences of hospital strain, promote equity, and increase the resilience of Canada's healthcare system.",10,10a

C17859,Investigating genetic overlap between severe Covid manifestation and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease,"Our studies on the genetic code in people with Alzheimer's disease have identified several genes that are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's. These genes function in the immune cells of the brain, and research by us and others is currently testing exactly how these genes alter the function of these immune cells in people that develop Alzheimer's. Recent work has shown that at least one of the Alzheimer's risk genes we identified also determines whether an individual will also show critical illness with COVID-19. Our work therefore suggests that inheriting a common variant of this gene called OAS1 can increase the risk of developing both Alzheimer's disease and a severe response to COVID-19. Our current research is investigating the function of this OAS1 gene in different immune cell models. Understanding how this gene functions will allow us to predict better which people will develop Alzheimer's later in life and a severe response with COVID-19.

C07023,URBAN ARCH 4/5 Russia Cohort-Targeting HIV-comorbidities with Pharmacotherapy to Reduce Alcohol and Tobacco Use in HIV-infected Russians,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTOver 4,000,000 people worldwide are infected with COVID19 and cases are rising. Acute respiratory infections(e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Virus), are associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, andearly data indicate that COVID19 is associated with higher CVD risk. People living with HIV (PLWH) also haveincreased CVD risk compared to uninfected people and this risk is highest among those who arehazardous drinkers and smokers. Our research is designed to reduce CVD risk among these high riskPLWH and to elucidate key mechanism(s). St PETER HIV (U01AA020780) is a randomized controlled trial inSt. Petersburg, Russia comparing the effects of nicotinic partial agonists on alcohol consumption, smoking,and inflammation and CVD risk among PWLH who are heavy drinkers and smokers. The Alcohol associatedComorbidity and Microbiome Evaluation (ACME ½ U01AA026222) study, nested within St PETER HIV,examines the gut microbiome as a novel pathway for increased CVD risk among these PLWH. HIV infectionand hazardous drinking both cause microbial translocation, which increases systemic inflammation and leadsto CVD. Whether COVID19 co-infection among PLWH who drink and smoke increases inflammation,alters the gut microbiome (i.e., reduces beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria which protect the gutfrom microbial translocation) and by extension alters the plasma metabolome (e.g., reduces plasmabutyrate levels) is unknown. Sparse data describe the prevalence of COVID19 among PLWH who are heavydrinkers and smokers, and no data exist assessing the association between COVID19 and biomarker levels ofinflammation and the plasma metabolome (e.g., butyrate) in this population. Our overarching hypothesis isthat COVID19 is a CVD risk factor among heavy drinking and smoking PLWH. For this application, wehypothesize that COVID19 infection will be: (1) common among St PETER HIV participants; (2) associatedwith increased inflammation (e.g., higher IL-6); and (3) associated with an unfavorable metabolomic profile(i.e., lower plasma butyrate) as compared to those not infected with COVID19. To test our hypotheses, we willleverage existing data from and collect new data among St PETER HIV and ACME 1/2 participants includingalcohol measures using the timeline follow-back; biomarkers of inflammation, data on comorbid conditions,longitudinal stored blood and fecal samples and imaging data. New data will include: COVID19 survey itemsand testing, alcohol and smoking data, and inflammatory/metabolomic biomarker testing. We will leveragethese data to complete Aim 1: to describe and estimate prevalence of COVID19 infection in the St PETER HIVcohort; Aim 2: to determine the association between COVID19 infection and biomarkers of systemicinflammations; and Aim 3 (exploratory) to determine metabolic profiles among heavy drinking and smokingPLWH. Completing these aims will advance understanding of COVID19 effects on innate immune function andthe plasma metabolome. Results will inform future interventions targeting the GI microbiome among PLWH.","3, 4","3d, 4a, 4b"
C06657,1) Optimizing eCD4-Ig for eradication and a functional cure,"SAR-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a human pathogenic coronavirus that is very similar to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1). As of this writing, more than 40,000 people are reported to be infected with this virus, causing more than 1,000 deaths. It is hoped that the number of new cases will decline precipitously in the coming weeks and months, and that newly available therapies can prevent more deaths. However, it is already clear that SARS-CoV-2 will remain a concern, real or potential, over the several next years. The team assembled here has extensive experience the study of SARS-CoV. We identified its receptor - also the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 - as ACE2 (Li et al., Nature 2003), delineated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein (Wong et al., J Biol Chem 2004), created the first efficient retroviral pseudotype system to study SARS-CoV S protein-mediated entry (Moore et al., J Virol 2004), identified and characterized a broad neutralizing antibody recognizing the RBD in collaboration with Wayne Marasco (Sui et al, PNAS, 2004), described the structure of the RBD bound to ACE2 with Stephen Harrison (Li et al., Science, 2005), described critical S-protein determinants of zoonosis and disease severity (Li et al., EMBO J, 2005), showed in separate collaborations with David Ho and Shibo Jiang that the S protein or the RBD alone can raise potent neutralizing antisera (Chen et al., J Virol 2005; He et al., J Immunol, 2006), and observed that cathepsin L was necessary for S protein-mediated infection (Huang et al., J Biol Chem, 2006). The current proposal seeks to apply this experience and the tools and approaches we developed for SARSCoV to: (1) develop, characterize, and optimize protein inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry including immunoadhesin forms of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region, anti-ACE2 antibodies, and anti-S protein antibodies, (2) determine whether S-protein-trimers or the RBD, or a combination thereof, most efficiently raise SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.",1,"1b, 1d"
C06719,CTSA Administrative Supplement for Informatics Core: A novel AI/ML system to predict respiratory failure and ARDS in Covid-19 patients,"PROJECT Summary: The Einstein-Montefiore Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) proposes an AdministrativeSupplement pursuant to NOT-TR-20-011, CTSA Program Applications to Address 2019 Novel Coronavirus(Covid-19). Specifically, this application addresses the urgent need for research on the coronavirus pandemicwith a project focusing on informatics and data science to preemptively identify patients with the life-threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2, using CTSA-supported core resources. Characterized by severehypoxemia, tachypnea, and decreased lung compliance, the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF) is abad prognostic sign, and in a subset, leads to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).The rates of Covid-19 infection and death in the Bronx have been higher than any other borough of NYC. Asthe major regional health system, our experience with Covid-19 provides guideposts that may prevent futurevictims of this pandemic. The bleak picture for ARDS in the 4,452 patients admitted showed that 78% of ourintubated Covid-19 patients developed ARDS, with 42% mortality. The overall goal of this proposal is toleverage our novel informatics and analytics platforms enabled by the Einstein-Montefiore CTSA (NIH/NCATS1ULTR002556), and extensive Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning resources to implement a novel,situational awareness and clinical decision support system for ARF and ARDS (SA-ARDS). We will re-train ourexisting deep learning models with data collected from Covid-19 patients and contextualize its implementationwith data from the Covid-19 response during the pandemic in NYC. The SA-ARDS data platform will providelongitudinally integrated clinical data for research and multi-institutional and national collaborations, with thefollowing specific aims: Aim 1: To integrate, re-train, and validate our novel, near real-time, Electronic RiskAssessment System (ERAS 1.0) optimized for early recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality; Aim 2:To develop an evidence based, real-time, and context appropriate Situational Awareness clinical decisionsupport system targeting ARF and ARDS response (SA-ARDS); and Aim 3: Through our partner CTSAorganizations, to standardize and disseminate ERAS 1.0 and the SA-ARDS to other health systems, includingthe NYC consortium of CTSA hubs and the PCORI INSIGHT network. We will use the clinical data underlyingthe SA-ARDS to support research in local, regional, and national collaborations. All the methods and toolsdeveloped will be shared with the CTSA community via NCATS' National Center for Data to Health (CD2H).",4,4c
C06839,The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality,"PROJECT SUMMARY/Abstract: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public healthdisaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smokingand comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19,therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searchingmodifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Airpollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung functionimpairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States havesuggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to theCOVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deathsin large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollutionexposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low socialeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in theanalysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID-19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specificaims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigatingprenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APARstudy, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed byhospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available throughEMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptomonset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis willbe used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for eachcase by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date.Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollutionexposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSCmembers have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity,smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extractedto control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resourceand world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance ourknowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death.",3,"3b, 3d, 4a, 4d"
C06277,OSIRIX Revolutionary vaccines to prevent pandemic and seasonal outbreaks of respiratory viral infections: The best-in-class UNIVERSAL multi-season influenza vaccine,"While an ongoing pandemic outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) is having enormous impact on global societies, a quest for effective vaccination becomes of unprecedented importance to save lives and economies globally.   Symptomatic flu, another respiratory RNA viral infection, affects ~10% of global population every year and leads to regular pandemic outbreaks. Existing prophylactic vaccination requires updates each flu season or pandemic outbreak, and has a strikingly limited efficacy (40% on average, as low as 9% in elderly). This is mainly due to a rapid mutation rate of surface viral proteins that are targeted by the current vaccines. Governments, institutions and vaccine community urgently seek for a universal flu vaccine that would provide a multi-season protection against all seasonal and emerging pandemic viral strains.    OSIVAX, a French clinical stage innovative biotech, strives to develop vaccines able to prevent respiratory viral infections across multiple seasons and outbreak. OSIVAX has developed OVX836, a best-in-class, game-changing universal flu vaccine candidate.   OVX836 is based on oligoDOM®, a proprietary immune-boosting technology that triggers powerful, targeted and durable immune responses involving activation of specific immune response killing infected cells. OVX836 circumvents the need for annual vaccination updates by targeting an intraviral protein that is highly conserved across all influenza strains.   OVX836 has a potential to disrupt the flu vaccine market currently dominated by single-season vaccines. The revolutionary universal flu vaccine is predicted to have a blockbuster potential (>€2.5 billion). OSIVAX's experienced team aims to get OVX836 ready for the clinical proof-of-efficacy milestone (Phase IIb) that will position the company for >€500M licensing deal with a big pharma in 2024.     At the moment, OSIVAX leverages this revolutionary clinical-stage technology to initiate the development of a universal vaccine against corona",7,7a
P22616,Yersina perstis interactions with macrophages,"Plague, an emerging infectious disease endemic to multiple continents, including North   and South America, is a top priority in national biodefense. Studying pathogenic yersiniae, the   bacteria responsible for plague, provides valuable insights into pathogenesis and evolution.   Genomic sequencing of the Yersinia genus and extensive Yersinia pestis genomes spanning   from the Bronze Age to the present offer a rich resource for this research.   A distinct feature of plague infections is the lack of inflammation at bacterial replication   sites. Recent studies on pneumonic plague reveal a two-phase course: a delayed inflammatory   response followed by a highly inflammatory phase as the disease progresses. In the initial   phase, non-human primate and mouse models show no cellular infiltration. Extracellular   presence of Y. pestis in primate lungs does not trigger inflammation. In a rat model of bubonic   plague, neutrophil infiltration into draining lymph nodes is delayed, and infected sites undergo   necrosis instead of inflammation. Comparisons between Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis   infections demonstrate neutrophil recruitment but inadequate containment of the infection.   Research on the type III secretion system and other virulence factors has explored their role in   neutralizing early inflammatory responses. However, understanding macrophage polarization   during early plague stages remains incomplete. A central hypothesis suggests that Y. pestis   prevents inflammation by inhibiting M1 polarization or inducing M2 macrophages Investigating   these mechanisms will enhance knowledge of how macrophage polarization contributes to early   immune suppression in plague, preventing the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes   (PMNs) and promoting the initial anti-inflammatory stage of plague.   Aim 1. Investigate macrophage polarization after Yersinia pestis exposure to block   inflammation by either inhibiting M1 polarization or inducing M2 macrophages.   Aim 2. Determine signaling pathways induced and mechanisms used by Y. pestis to   influence macrophage polarization.   Aim 3. Examine the virulence factors utilized by Y. pestis to polarize macrophages.",1,"1b, 1c, 1d"
P25458,"Quality, safety and clinical governance in NHS and independent hospitals: lessons from the interface","Every patient has the right to expect safe, high quality care whether they are treated in an NHS hospital or an independent hospital. We propose new research to help understand and improve the quality and safety of patient care in NHS and independent hospitals. Independent hospitals are private sector organisations which provide health care to patients who pay, directly or through private insurance, and which are often also contracted to provide care for some patients funded by the NHS.  We will learn about the systems which oversee the quality and safety of patient care, which are often termed 'Äúclinical governance'Äù. Good clinical governance is the foundation of good patient care.     The need for this research was demonstrated by the public inquiry into the case of Ian Paterson, a surgeon who worked across both NHS and independent hospitals. He carried out inappropriate and unnecessary operations over many years, finally being suspended from practice, and eventually imprisoned. The inquiry report found he could have been stopped from harming patients eight years earlier and it recommended national changes to improve clinical governance. In 2018 a report from the health regulator also criticised the way independent hospitals monitored and reported on clinical performance, and in response a new framework for clinical governance for independent hospitals was introduced.      For the first time, in 2022, information about all patients treated in both NHS and independent hospitals will be brought together in one dataset, and we plan to use this to compare quality and performance and provide information for better clinical governance.    The main aim of our research is to understand how quality and safety is monitored across both NHS and independent hospitals and how newly available data can be used to provide information to support this. Our research has four main aims. Firstly, we will describe and compare the care provided in NHS and independent hospitals and how that has changed over time. Secondly, we will observe and assess doctors'Äô work in both NHS and independent hospitals and how clinical governance works. Thirdly, we will examine how the quality and safety of care varies across NHS and independent hospitals (measuring things like readmissions, deaths and patients transferred from independent to NHS hospitals). Fourthly, we will explore how the working arrangements between NHS and independent hospitals have changed during (and after) the COVID-19 pandemic.    To do this, we will analyse the new national dataset covering all patients in NHS and independent hospitals. We will also send questionnaires to the staff who lead clinical governance in NHS and independent hospitals, and researchers will visit hospitals to conduct interviews and focus groups with patients who have experience of care in both settings, and to observe and interview doctors and other professionals who work across both NHS and independent hospitals.    We have already worked closely with a patient and public involvement group in developing this proposal and incorporated their views into the research plan. We have a PPI co-applicant on our research team, we will have a PPI Forum for the project and will involve PPI collaborators in interviewing patients in our research as well as in the oversight of the project through our project advisory group.","9, 11","9e, 11a, 11e"

C03805,Molecular and Immunologic Analysis of the Pathobiology of Human Anthrax,"Project Summary The continuing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases has led to an urgent need to developstrategies for identifying patients who are likely to have mild vs. severe disease to optimally allocate healthcare resources. It is also critical that we understand why certain patients develop severe disease. One possiblemechanism is through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) a phenomenon well documented for otherviruses including SARS. In order to develop safe and effective vaccines, it is essential that we determinewhether the humoral immune response to Covid-19 induces antibodies that can mediate ADE and tounderstand which aspects of the immune response to the virus correlate with good clinical outcomes.Addressing this knowledge gap quickly is necessary to inform vaccine trials, which are already underway orare about to start. Our multidisciplinary team has the expertise to address the issues described above. As an independentnon-profit research institution, we are nimble and responsive to evolving health needs. Besides studying aspectrum of patients from across Oklahoma, we are uniquely positioned to look at the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection for Native Americans. Native Americans have the shortest life expectancy of any ethnic groupin the US with higher rates of nearly every co-morbidity associated with higher mortality with SARS-CoV-2infection (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension). Oklahoma is home to 39 federally recognizedtribes and has the 2nd highest number of American Indians (482,760 according to the 2010 census, and highestpercentage, >10%) in the US. Through our Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources (OSCTR),we have partnerships with 5 major tribes, urban Indian clinics and the Southern Plains Tribal Health Boardrepresenting all tribes in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. Through these and other interactions, we have strongties to obtain samples from Native Americans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and exposure.Specific Aims1. Identify biomarkers and mechanisms of severe Covid-19 disease pathogenesis2. Characterize the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection3. Characterize the T cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infectionWhenever feasible, we will compare the responses of Native Americans to those of European Americans todetermine whether Native Americans experience worse outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection and if so, whichparts of the immune response is/are suboptimal. We will also compare the responses of individuals with mildvs. severe disease. The knowledge gained should lead to better care for individuals with Covid-19 disease.","1, 4","1d, 4b"

P22182,HIV-1 Env gp160 maturation in the Golgi apparatus,"HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) 160 belongs to class I fusion proteins that are also expressed by other  highly pathogenic human viruses including influenza A viruses (IAV), Ebola viruses (EBOV), and coronaviruses  (CoV) such as SARS-CoV (SARS1), MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2). They build spikes on the viral  envelope that induce fusion of viral and cellular membranes to allow viruses to enter cells, which is essential to  the viral infection. Class I fusion proteins are synthesized as a type I transmembrane (TM) polypeptide  precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and delivered to the Golgi apparatus for maturation. The  Golgi contains glycosidases/glycosyltransferases for glycosylation and conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG)  complex and other associated proteins such as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor  (SNARE) proteins for trafficking. Inside the Golgi, high-mannose-type N-glycans are processed into complex-  type and hybrid-type N-glycans after extensive mannose-trimming, and O-glycosylation also occurs. These  precursors except for SARS1-spike (S) are further subjected to proteolytic cleavage by furin to complete the  maturation process. When these steps are disrupted in the Golgi, no infectious particles are produced, leading  to complete inhibition of viral infection. Recently, we and others reported that MARCH8, a member of the  membrane-associated RING-CH-type E3 ubiquitin ligase family, broadly inhibits viral replication by targeting  a wide range of fusion proteins. Importantly, we reported that MARC causes multiple defects in class I  H8  fusion maturation in the Golgi via an unknown mechanism. These defects are found not only in furin-cleavage  of HIV-1 gp160, IAV-hemagglutinin (HA), EBOV-glycoprotein (GP), MERS-S, and SARS2-S, but also in N- and  O-glycosylation of SARS2-S, MERS-S, and EBOV-GP in the Golgi. Although MARCH8 does not trigger the  degradation of these fusion proteins, its E3 ligase function is still required for causing these defects. The goal of  this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of these multiple defects in HIV-1 gp160 maturation  by understanding the MARCH8 antiviral mechanism. We hypothesize that MARCH8 targets glycosidases,  glycosyltransferases, furin, COG complex, and/or SNARE to block HIV-1 gp160 maturation. We propose  two distinct but inter-related Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize how MARCH8  blocks gp160 maturation during HIV-1 infection. Experiments will be performed in primary cells and human  T cell lines in combination with RNA silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout to elucidate the MARCH8 anti-  HIV activity. In Aim 2, we will identify the MARCH8 targets that play a critical role in HIV-1 gp160 maturation.  We will focus on 18 Golgi proteins selected by high confidence bioinformatic analysis to identify the targets. The  significance of this project is very high, which will not only fill in gaps in our understanding of class I fusion  protein glycosylation and trafficking in the Golgi, but also elucidate a novel antiviral mechanism that can be  broadly applied to several highly pathogenic human viruses including HIV-1, SARS2, EBOV, and IAV.","1, 6","1c, 6a"

A -promising approach to both patient management of emerging viral infections and to better preparedness and response to emerging epidemics is the use of monoclonal antibodies. MANCO aims at contributing to the rapid international response against 2019-nCoV, through preclinical and clinical evaluation of monoclonal antibodies against 2019-nCoV. MANCO will build on and leverage outstanding results from ongoing IMI-funded project #115760 ZAPI, including recently-discovered broadly cross-reactive H2L2 monoclonal antibodies against betacoronaviruses and an established pipeline for rapid identification of specific H2L2 monoclonal antibodies against 2019-nCoV; antibodies that will be selected to proceed to GMP manufacturing in high-yield CHO cell-lines. This project furthermore builds on ZAPI consortium'Äôs experience and expertise for the development and establishment of relevant animal models, to ensure preclinical efficacy and safety, including absence of antibody-dependent enhancement, an issue seen to occur in some immunization studies against feline and SARS CoVs. Based on the generated preclinical data, MANCO will advance one lead (prophylactic and/or therapeutic) monoclonal antibody into a Phase I clinical trial that can be completed within two years of the start of the project, by leveraging clinical expertise, infrastructure and network currently in place for ongoing CEPI-funded projects on candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV (#INID1801) and Rift Valley Fever virus (#INLA1901), and H2020-funded projects on improved vaccines targeting the elderly (ISOLDA #848166) and on universal influenza vaccines, including in LMICs (ENDFLU #874650).",6,6a
C19688,How will the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination among Indigenous peoples in the Northwest Territories change over time?,"Immune response to vaccination can be different for many people, depending on age, sex, gender, and ethnicity. Some may have a reduced response, and it is important to measure this among different populations to understand the effectiveness of the COVID-19 (C19) vaccine. This is essential for pandemic policy and planning to implement strong vaccination programs, ease the impact of C19, and find out if and when booster shots may be needed. With full engagement in research leadership, collaboration, and decision-making, and sharing of knowledge with the communities, the Community Advisory Board (CAB) and partners this project will: 1) look at C19 immune response at two time points using dried blood spots taken by a finger prick among both vaccinated and unvaccinated Indigenous peoples in 4 Northwest Territories (NT) Tlicho communities; and 2) share results with communities and all partners. We will collect important new information for the prevention of C19 as there is currently limited evidence available on the effectiveness of the C19 vaccine for Indigenous peoples. This work has involved a process of consultation and agreement with the Tlicho Government to ensure methods are culturally safe and relevant and that outcomes will provide direct community benefit. We will provide training and employment to local community staff, as we have done successfully in other projects.

C14316,Global trade of coronavirus hosts: bringing geographically isolated hosts and viruses together risks novel recombination and spillover to humans,"Novel pathogenic coronaviruses - such as SARS-CoV and probably SARS-CoV-2 - arise by two coronaviruses co-infecting viruses a single host cell, and then 'swapping' parts of their genome. The result of this swapping (termed homologous recombination) is a novel daughter virus containing components of each parent virus. These viruses then circulate in reservoir animal populations before spillover to humans.    Our previous work has identified mammalian and avian hosts susceptible to each coronavirus and hosts biologically susceptible to multiple coronavirus strains (recombination hosts).    Here, using a novel ecological network approach, integrating presence, habitat, and behaviour indicating ecological traits of host species, we will build on our previous work to predict contact facilitated sharing of coronaviruses. Combining these predictions with epidemiologically-relevant spatial predictors, will allow us to predict geographical hotspots of coronavirus recombination (Work package 1), and therefore enable specific spatially-targeted surveillance and mitigation efforts.    Many coronavirus hosts interact with humans (e.g. through geographic/habitat overlap), or are used by humans as (e.g. pets/food). By enriching our novel network from WP1 with host species utilisation data from open-access sources, we will estimate the in situ likelihood of spillover from our previously identified hosts (Work package 2). Highlighting priority species and geographic hotspots for spillover mitigation efforts.    Wild animal trade has been implicated in the spillover of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, to humans. Trade could also readily facilitate homologous recombination in otherwise geographically isolated hosts and their respective coronaviruses. Utilising global animal trade and usages in our predictive framework will enable us to assess the impact of trade on spillover and recombination risk (Work package 3). Understanding the relative risk of wild host trade will allow insight into avoidable human influence on novel coronavirus generation.","2, 3","2a, 3a"
C06204,Safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"Treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed but safety and efficacy of novel candidate therapeutics need to be assessed first before phase 1 clinical trials start. Therefore, appropriate in vitro and in vivo assays need to be included in a pre-clinical  development workflow. These assays need to be carefully selected, optimized and streamlined in order to provide the appropriate data for rapid response and treatment development. The knowledge on COVID-19 intervention strategies and  potential side effects of those is now accumulating, and a pre-clinical safety and efficacy assessment workflow needs to be able to easily and rapidly accommodate additional assays. One of the promising treatment options for COVID-19 includes the use of virus-neutralizing antibodies that block virus entry into the cell and thus are considered powerful means to block viral infection. However, several studies suggest that low level (non)-neutralizing antibodies may pose a risk for severe lung disease on virus re-exposure. The latter should be included in the safety assessment of candidate antibodies as early as possible in order to prioritize Abs that are not going to fail in the later stage of the (pre-) clinical development.     The current proposed project aims at contributing to the rapid international public health response against SARS-CoV-2 by    (i) testing the efficacy and safety of lead candidate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (e.g. the antibody 49D11 and others identified by Erasmus MC and AMC) using in vitro assays and in vivo animal models; and by   (ii) developing, validating and sharing with the research community a workflow of protocols for rapid testing of the efficacy and safety of recently identified candidate antiviral antibodies and plasma preparations for (a) efficacy and safety in in vitro systems; and (b) efficacy and safety in in vivo animal models.

C20496,Peripheral Inflammatory Disease (COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease) and Brain Gliosis,"Inflammation is the body's natural response to infection or injury, like the redness that happens around a scrape on the skin. In conditions where inflammation is very active, it is possible for the inflammation to affect the brain. This is especially seen in two conditions where clinical depression occurs very frequently: COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). After recovering from COVID-19, approximately 15% of people experience clinical depression. Similarly, depression occurs three to five times more frequently in people with IBD than in the general population. Unfortunately, there are no treatments designed for depression from COVID-19 and IBD because little is known about how inflammation affects the brain in these conditions. We think that inflammation from other parts of the body spreads to the brain in COVID-19 and IBD, but this has not been studied yet. Using new brain scanning methods, we are able to measure levels of inflammation in the brain. In our previous research, we used these methods to show that brain inflammation occurs in clinical depression and that higher levels of inflammation may lead to more severe depressive symptoms. And now, our new data shows that these levels may be higher in COVID-19 and IBD. Brain scans in a few people that have recovered from COVID-19 showed a 15% to 30% increase in inflammation and a brain scan in one person with IBD showed an increase over 50%. In our new study, we propose scanning more participants with these conditions to see if brain inflammation is consistently higher than in the general population. If this is the case, then medications that can reduce inflammation in the brain may be effective in treating depression caused by inflammatory diseases like COVID-19 and IBD. In fact, there are already some medications available for other illnesses that can reduce brain inflammation, they just need to be tested for other purposes. ",10,10a

In collaboration with the Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC 4C) at Edinburgh University and the Charite Hospital (Berlin) Crick researchers are developing newly designed high-throughput mass spectrometry-based platforms to obtain unbiased information about disease progression and distinctions between patients with severe and moderate Covid-19 disease.,4,"4a, 4b"
C20478,Online Peer-Delivered Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Postpartum Depression,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most common complications of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of mothers in the first year after delivery. If untreated, it can have negative effects on the mother, their partner, their newborn, and the other children in the family. Unfortunately, just 1 in 10 mothers with PPD are able to get the treatments they most want and need (e.g., talking therapies), a situation that has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, innovative, sustainable, and engaging options that safely provide treatment to large numbers of mothers are urgently needed.The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of an Online 9-Week Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT; a type of talking therapy) program delivered by mothers who themselves have recovered from PPD (i.e., lay peers). We will recruit 174 mothers who currently have PPD and infants 12 months of age. Mothers will either receive group CBT plus treatment as usual (TAU) from their usual healthcare providers or TAU alone. This study will determine if this online group treatment can lead to stable improvements in PPD, maternal anxiety, parenting stress, their relationships with their partner and infant, and infant temperament. We believe that this peer-delivered treatment will improve PPD and its accompanying difficulties, as well as reduce its adverse effects on families in a cost-effective manner.In addition to the suffering that PPD imposes on mothers and families, the financial cost of untreated PPD may be as high as $150,000 per case over the lifespan. If effective, peer-delivered group CBT for PPD could provide the healthcare system with an affordable and scalable treatment that can improve the health of mothers and families during the pandemic and beyond. ",10,10a
C09569,"Understanding the COVID-19, Racism, and Violence Syndemic and its Effects on COVID-19 Testing Disparities","Project SummaryBlack communities in the US are experiencing three converging public health crises: COVID-19, systemicracism, and community and police violence. Black Americans are significantly less likely to receive a neededCOVID-19 test and have higher rates of COVID-19 infection and death than white Americans. Additionally,Black communities have experienced a surge in gun violence in 2020 and continue to be victims of policeharassment and violence, resulting in large-scale social justice demonstrations. The convergence of theseepidemics has created a syndemic, wherein racism, violence, and COVID-19 cluster in predominantly Blackand low-income communities. The proposed study aims to characterize this syndemic to understand howpersonal and systemic racism and violence in Black communities may influence COVID-19 testing decisions.This mixed-method study with Black residents of Chicago, IL will result in community-driven recommendationsto enhance COVID-19 testing and prevention strategies and address this emerging syndemic. We will examinethe potential mediating pathways of medical mistrust, psychological trauma and stress, and economic injustice.Additionally, we will take a strengths-based approach to understand potential protective factors includingneighborhood cohesion, social support, and access to health care. The specific aims of the study are to: 1)Qualitatively examine how experiences of racial discrimination, community violence, and police violenceinfluence trust in and engagement with healthcare systems and contribute to decisions around COVID-19testing and mitigation strategies (e.g. social distancing) among Black individuals in Chicago (N=50); 2)Quantitatively assess the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 testing among Black residents in Chicago (N= 500) and characterize the COVID-19, racism, and violence syndemic; and 3) In partnership with aCommunity Advisory Council, use an integrative translational workshop approach and intervention mappingtechniques to develop community and data-driven recommendations and an intervention blueprint for localhealth departments, researchers, and public health organizations to improve COVID-19 testing among BlackAmericans. This study will result in policy and research recommendations, community resources, and a'shovel-ready' intervention blueprint to enhance COVID-19 testing and address this emerging syndemic.",9,9a

The restrictions imposed to reduce the transmission of the virus have deleterious effects on the elderly and consequences on caregivers. In order to mitigate the negative effects, different strategies are used to maintain contact with loved ones and thus promote actions to protect the mental and physical state of seniors. However, the evaluation of the implementation and effects of innovative interventions in the context of a pandemic in elderly people with cognitive impairment have not been studied to date in Canada. In collaboration with 5 LTCH partners, the goal of the project is to evaluate the implementation process, the viability and the acceptability of interventions aimed at favoring the presence of loved ones (in person or virtually), as well as the effects on residents, their loved ones and related costs. An evaluative research estimate is preferred. A multiple case study will be used to describe the reality of the target environments and actors, grasp the complex relationships between the different factors, document the degree and variability of implementation in the different environments and their results. Residents with cognitive disorders, their caregivers and members of the care team will be recruited in each setting. Interventions that maintain contact with loved ones and are supported by the living environment can mitigate the repercussions of isolation and have a considerable impact on anxiety, cognitive and behavioral symptoms, and quality of life. By giving a voice to elders, relatives, and caregivers, documentation of acceptability will add evidence that tailored, humane interventions are viable and relevant in LTCFs.]",10,"10a, 10b"
C20363,The Genetics Navigator: A novel digital platform for delivering personalized genetic services,"Genomic sequencing (GS) is a test that scans a person's genetic code to identify changes that may be disease-causing. GS is increasingly being used for patient care as it improves diagnosis and health outcomes. In spite of these benefits, GS is a complex and costly health service. This results in unequal access, increased wait times and inconsistencies in care. The use of eHealth tools to support GS delivery can result in a better patient experience and reduced distress associated with waiting for results and empower patients to receive and act on medical results. Our study will develop a patient centred eHealth platform to deliver GS services and then evaluate its effectiveness compared to usual care. The platform will include a conversational chatbot and innovative strategies for pre-and post-test genetic counselling and result reporting. First, we will identify the key components of this novel platform with end-users and build the chatbot to provide educational, decisional and emotional support to patients. We will then conduct usability testing with a pan-Canadian sample of patients and health care providers to ensure the platform is patient-centred and optimized for a range of contexts. Next, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial, to understand if our eHealth platform is better than usual care. Patients undergoing GS will be randomly assigned to receive either our eHealth platform or usual care that consists of meeting with genetics providers in-person or over the phone. The outcomes include patients' distress, experience, satisfaction, empowerment, knowledge, perceived utility, behaviour change, and cost effectiveness. This study represents a significant advance in personalized health by developing a novel, comprehensive eHealth platform to improve genetic service delivery, accessibility, patient experiences, and patient outcomes. The shift to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the critical importance of this platform","10, 11","10a, 11a"
C15107,Development and Deployment of an Electrochemical Antigen Testing System for SARS-CoV-2,"Project Summary:  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the shortcomings of existing testing approaches for viral infection.  Diagnosing active infections using PCR or other amplification strategies is constrained to centralized testing  facilities that have limited capacity. New point-of-care molecular testing approaches, while providing a means  to test outside of laboratories, have low throughput and turnaround times that are not compatible with  widespread, rapid screening. Moreover, the use of nasopharyngeal swabs is highly problematic given the  difficultly of acquiring and processing this sample type. Antibody tests integrated into lateral flow devices  utilize a more tractable sample type and are effective for estimating infection rates, but are not useful for  detecting active infections.  In this proposal we describe a new viral detection approach that is rapid, amenable to massively decentralized  testing, and provides a new means to perform viral infection assessment as a tool to combat the current  COVID-19 pandemic and control future viral outbreaks. The new technology powering this approach is a  breakthrough in reagentless sensing accomplished using electrochemical readout that will enable rapid  screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensors will directly detect viral particles and viral proteins based on  a unique signal transduction mechanism and can be used for in situ measurements inside of the mouth or in  saliva samples. The fact that no external reagents are required makes this approach particularly amenable to  decentralized on-demand testing.  Project deliverables will include a screening system that will allow for direct SARS-CoV-2 detection from a  saliva sample (without the generation of aerosols) in a time frame relevant at-home community screening. This  will accelerate the availability of high-quality and real-time data to support a rapid response to better detect  and manage COVID-19. In addition, the low cost and portable nature of the diagnostic device will allow for  deployment to low- and middle-income countries to help prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 within those  populations.  The rapid viral detection system will: 1) Provide an alternative to PCR-based testing and accelerate the  availability of high-quality diagnostic information to allow Americans to better manage the pandemic; 2)  Develop an effective intervention that will provide rapid, actionable diagnostic information on COVID-19 status;  3) Enable clinical studies that assess viral load as a function of medical countermeasures by facilitating serial  and continuous monitoring of patients for SARS-CoV-2.",1,1a
P22170,Engineering a human neuroimmune specific viral vector from Zika virus,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Inflammation has been implicated in nearly every neuropsychiatric and degenerative disease,  yet neuroimmune cells remain nearly intractable by every available therapeutic strategy. Small  molecule drugs consistently fail clinical trials, as neuroimmune signaling pathways have essential  pleiotropic functions in neighboring cell types. Meanwhile cell type selective therapies remain elusive,  as microglia, and other neuroimmune cells, are intrinsically resistant to gene therapy vectors.  Overcoming these unique challenges demands a new approach to medicine, drawing from an unlikely  source of neuroimmune specific bioactivity.   In nature, the Zika virus (ZKV) infects microglia, suppresses inflammation, and stimulates  autophagy so expertly that almost half of infections go unnoticed. If this bioactivity could be safely  refined, it would offer relief for neurodegenerative disorders from ParkinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s to Alzheimer's disease.  Parsing therapeutic from pathogenic mechanisms of the ZKV genome presents much greater  complexity than ever previously addressed, but recent advances make it possible. Recombinant ZKV  vectors, already in use, provide starting material for synthetic biology, while new viral assisted and  continuous evolution methods allow bioengineering at scales capable of reshaping whole genomes.  We can harness ZKVÃ¢Â€Â™s microglia specific immunosuppressive mechanisms into therapies with  potential beyond any current technology. This proposal presents the first steps along the path  towards an entirely new kind of therapy for neurodegenerative disorders.",1g,1
P23215,A Fully Integrated Point-of-Care Test for Ebola,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The objective of this proposal is to develop a new point-of-care test (POCT)Ã¢Â€Â""the D4 assayÃ¢Â€Â""for early field-  detection of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Currently, EBOV is diagnosed by RNA detection using reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR requires a makeshift BSL-4 grade laboratory in the  field, expensive equipment, and highly trained personnel. Other POCTs, including the user-friendly lateral-flow  assay (LFA), lack the sensitivity for early detection that is critical for timely intervention with the available  antibody cocktail that yields 90% survival rates for patients with low viremia. Our objective is motivated by an  urgent clinical need for a POCT that (1) detects EBOV infection in the field quickly and reliably, (2) requires little  on-field infrastructure, (3) yields results in 30 min, and (4) matches or exceeds the performance of RT-PCR. To  achieve these goals, we have designed an integrated POCT the D4 assay that has four simple stepsÃ¢Â€Â""dispense,  dissolve, diffuse, and detect that require limited handling and skill to perform. This new-frontier technology takes  advantage of the presence of an unmistakable, viral secreted glycoprotein sGP that is present in the serum of  infected patients very early in infection. We have generated customized monoclonal antibodies (Abs) for sGP to  use in the D4 assay. The current prototype D4 assay that we have designed detects EBOV infection at least one  day earlier than RT-PCR in infected monkeys and at a far lower cost than RT-PCR or LFA. In this proposal,  we plan to advance our development and improve the sensitivity of the D4 assay further as well as reduce the  assay time from 60 min to 30 min. Our strategy is to increase the equilibrium binding constant of our current Ab  pair from ~10-9 M to ~10-11 M with antibody affinity maturation techniques and high-throughput screening of  antibody pairs. The enhanced D4 assay kit will have inkjet-printed capture and detection antibodies on a protein  and cell-resistant polymer brush on a glass plate encased in a passive capillarity microfluidics chip. The assay  output will be fluorescence of microspots on the D4 chip. We have developed a portable handheld fluorescence  detector to capture and image the spots and automatically convert them into the concentration of analytes for  quantitation and uploaded to a secure server. The design will be rigorously tested and validated with samples  from infected human cells and laboratory-challenged non-human primates. At the completion of this project, we  will have a field-ready, user-friendly, and highly sensitive POCT that will allow healthcare workers to detect EBOV  in serum, blood, or other bodily fluids in 30 min. The new design will push the current boundaries of EBOV  detection and facilitate more expedient deployment of infection control and patient support measures that can  yield 90% survival rates or better if implemented early in infection. Because the D4 POCT is multiplexable, it will  set a precedent for broader utility beyond EBOV to diagnose many other infectious diseases.",1,1a
C06255,RISCinCOVID Optimal use of hospital resources and intervention using suPAR for improving prognosis and care for patients with COVID-19,"Optimal use of hospital resources and intervention using suPAR for improving prognosis and care for patients with COVID-19       To optimize hospital resources, it is necessary to test which patients that can be sent home (mild outcome of infection) and which patients that should be admitted to hospital (high risk patients).     This will deliver on the tasks: 1) Identify patients that can safely cope with the infection at home and 2) Identify high risk patients early in the disease and 3) Select high-risk patients that may benefit of therapy.  But how can we identify low- or high-risk patients?    The suPARnostic test developed by ViroGates and CE/IVD approved for clinical use is highly prognostic marker for 30-day mortality.   Some hospitals have suPAR in routine clinical assessment of patient risk, and preliminary data support that suPAR levels can triage whether patients with COVID-19 will have a mild or a severe outcome of COVID-19 and thereby select which patients that could be discharged or admitted.    We aim to transfer manufacturing, upscale and implement the suPARnostic technology across hospitals in Europe to improve the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and optimize hospital resources. We furthermore provide a test method that can identify high-risk patients that may benefit from experimental therapeutic interventions that may impact on outcome. The identification of patients in high risk of mortality (patients with high suPAR) provide a possibility to intervene.",4,"4a, 4c"

The proposed work is part of the largerHuman Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS) study that allows a comparison betweenchildren with atopic conditions and children without those conditions. Although asthma has not beenidentified as a clear risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease, there is evidence that children with asthmaand other atopic conditions have increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections (Esquivel etal, AJRCCM, PMC5649984) and that viral respiratory infections may result in worsening of underlyingairway disease (Jartti et al, J Allergy Clin Immunol, PMID 28987219).

P22959,Assessing Flu-specific Humoral Immunity in Human Lung after Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Broadly reactive humoral immune responses to flu protect against viral variants. Murine  data shows that the flu-specific memory B cells (Bmem) in the lung are cross-protective across a number of  influenza strains and are functionally distinct from circulating and lymphoid counterparts. As yet we do not know  if flu-specific Bmem in the human lung are cross-protective and bridging this knowledge gap is important to  design the appropriate vaccine regimens that are universally protective against flu. Flu-specific Bmem in ex vivo  lung tissues are rare and this represents a significant technical hurdle in assaying the flu-specific Bmem response  in human lung tissues. In order to address this technical hurdle, this application seeks to establish a model  system wherein human lung tissue is challenged with influenza virus and maintained viable after this challenge  on an advanced cardiopulmonary modality called Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion or EVLP. We anticipate this model will  allow us to enumerate and analyze the flu-specific Bmem response at scale in ex vivo human lung tissues. We  also anticipate that this model system will allow us to compare binding reactivity to viral variants between flu-  specific Bmem located in lung versus mediastinal lymph node tissues to define where cross-protective immunity  exists in the respiratory tract.",1,"1b, 1d, 1e"

C04629,ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) - a companion study for patients with Cancer and COVID-19 (CCP-CANCER-UK),"2019 a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 emerged, which causes a disease termed COVID-19. This is often mild but can also be severe, leading to viral pneumonia; about one in 100 infected people are expected to die of i t. However, cancer patients are likely to be at higher risk of infection and death as they have a weakened immune system as a result of either their treatment or their cancer. We will tackle many urgent questions that need answering in cancer patients to help ensure early diagnosis, that the correct shielding advice i s given, and to enable doctors and patients to make informed decisions regarding treatment during the pandemic. This will be achieved by collecting detailed data from the over 5,000 cancer patients recruited into the main UK study which has described COVID-19 (CCP-UK study). The cancer data when linked with the rich COVID-19 data will enable the following important questions to be answered: What proportion of cancer patients die from COVID-19? How does this vary based on cancer type and cancer treatment? What are the symptoms cancer patients develop with COVID-19? Does this vary based on type of cancer and treatment? What type of cancer treatments puts people at higher risk of severe illness and death? What kind of healthcare resources are needed (including intensive care) to treat COVID-19 in cancer patients?

C19872,Understanding attitudes and beliefs toward the COVID-19 vaccines among youth with mental illness,"Background: People with mental illness (MI) have increased risk of contracting, and dying from, COVID-19 compared to the general population. Possible explanations include behavioural and structural factors (e.g., living in congregate settings). While COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates for people with mental illness is lacking, influenza vaccination uptake is generally lower than the general Canadian population. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, yet studies show that 11% to 18% of Canadians are hesitant. Black Canadians, Indigenous peoples, newcomers, and youth tend to have higher vaccine hesitancy and are more likely to experience social and structural barriers to accessing vaccinations. Youth between the ages of 16 and 29 are particularly vaccine-hesitant, with some of the lowest vaccination rates in Canada to date. Therefore, youth with MI may require more tailored interventions to increase uptake of COVID-19 vaccines.  Research Questions: 1) What are the beliefs and attitudes of youth with MI towards COVID-19 vaccines, including acceptance of vaccines? 2) What are youths' preferred method(s) of receiving and searching for information about COVID-19 vaccines?  Methods: We will conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews inquiring about youths' information needs, attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, and trust towards the healthcare system and vaccine manufacturers. We will also explore perceived severity of having COVID-19; susceptibility to developing COVID-19; benefits of, and barriers to, the vaccine and cues to action. Transcripts will be thematically analyzed.   Anticipated outcomes/impact: This co-designed project aims to promote vaccine uptake among youth with MI by 1) identifying recommendations for developing targeted, evidence-based public health campaigns, with a focus on COVID vaccines; 2) co-creating and piloting a vaccine campaign with youth with MI; and 3) develop clinical tools (e.g., clinical conversation guides) tailored for this population.",9,9d

P22528,Precision guided SIT for the control of vector-borne disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Billions of people are at risk of contracting vector-borne diseases. Dengue alone causes 90 million infections  per year globally and like many vector-borne diseases, currently there are no drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent  these infections. Therefore, vector control is the primary tool used for vector-borne disease prevention. In  recent years, novel vector population suppression technologies have been created (e.g. RIDL and Wolbachia  based systems), but production of mosquitoes for these programs is labor intensive and is limited in scalability  and distribution. In this study, we will use a functional genomic screening approach to identify key sex  determinate, female essential (FE) and male fertility (MF) genes in the dengue vector, Ae. aegypti. These studies  will improve our understanding of the biology of this important vector and it can be used to inform the design of  new genetic population suppression methods to control this vector. After these genes are identified and  characterized, we will incorporate them into the design of precision guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT)  technologies in an attempt to overcome limitations in traditional SIT control strategies. Sterile insect technique  (SIT) is the gold standard for insect population control but has many limitations. Our proposed technology aims  to simultaneously knock-out FE and MF genes using a binary CRISPR/Cas9 system in the Ae. aegypti disease  vector. One line will target one or more female essential FE genes and one or more MF genes and the other  line will express a Cas9. When these two lines are crossed, they create sterile, male progeny that are ready for  release into a population suppression program. To generate these lines, initially we will characterize >40  candidate FE and MF genes A. aegypti in single and combinatorial sgRNA screening assays in our previously  characterized Cas9 expression. These genes will be initially selected through transcriptomics, comparative  genomics and functional genomic studies. Gene targets that exhibit consistent FE or MF phenotypes will then  be engineered into transgenic Ae. aegypti line expressing guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting these genes. These  lines will then be crossed to multiple Cas9 lines and the fitness of each line and their F1 progeny will be  determined over many generations to ensure population stability. The design and integration of these  transgenes will then be varied and optimized to facilitate improved, stable and consistent phenotypes. These  optimization experiments will also address multiple fundamental questions about lethal biallelic mosaicism, a  phenomenon identified as driving pgSIT success in D. melanogaster, and endogenous Cas9 expression  systems, including the impact of transgene expression timing and transgene location on the long-term stability  of the lines. The optimal design and genes will then be evaluated in fitness and small population cage studies.  In the end, we aim to identify novel FE and MF genes that will allow us to better understand mosquito biology  and which allow us to create a genetic SIT system that improves upon traditional SIT technologies.",2,2c

Currently, COVID-19 is being diagnosedprimarily by three techniques, i.e. reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), genesequencing and chest computed tomography (CT). However, limitations of sample collection andtransportation, as well as kit performance with inadequate access to advanced instrumental techniques, oftencannot report COVID-19 at its initial presentation leading to the spread of this infectious disease to a widercommunity. Moreover, researchers found at least three central variants, distinguishable by amino acidchanges, among 160 different complete human SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. This limits the universalapplicability of the currently available commercial COVID-19 kits. In this proposal we present a novel approachfor screening of active COVID-19 cases with an electrochemical quantitative biosensor. This unique approachfor selective sensing of SARS-CoV-2 eliminates the possibility of misinterpretation arisen due to the genomicvariants of this virus which is the most concerning limitation of the current COVID-19 sensing kits. Weanticipate that our sensor can detect the specific target nucleic acid sequences without signal cross talk witha detection limit to be around 50 fg/ml with time of response to be around 2-3 mins.",1,1a
C00952,Functional and dysfunctional human CD4 T cell and B cell responses to bacteria and viruses,"PROJECT SUMMARYOverall ComponentCOVID19 is a severe ongoing pandemic. Our understanding of the immune response to this disease is lacking,which impairs both the development of proper therapeutics and a vaccine. Vaccines are one of the most costeffective and extraordinarily successful medical interventions. Most of those vaccines depend on CD4 T+ cellsand their help to B cells. We have developed multiple new techniques to study human CD4+ T cells over the pastseveral years, which have have been implementing in our LJI CCHI. The supplement proposed here will facilitaterapid and vigorous pursuit of an understanding of the T cell responses to SARS-CoV2 in humans, which mayhelp in the development of treatments and vaccines for COVID19.",1,1d
P21594,Targeting of RAG-dependent and -independent innate immune responses by the Ectromelia C15 protein,"Several members of the orthopoxvirus family, including variola (the cause of smallpox) and monkeypox, pose  serious threats to human health. Other members are equally severe in their natural hosts, including ectromelia  (ECTV), the cause of mousepox - a disease with many similarities to smallpox. The considerable virulence of  these large DNA viruses is attributable in great measure to their many proteins that impede both innate and  adaptive host defenses. The largest among these immunomodulatory proteins are the B22 family members,  which, despite their size and contributions to virulence, remain vastly understudied. Highly homologous B22  family members are present throughout the orthopoxviruses except for vaccinia, the attenuated orthopoxvirus  that has served as the smallpox vaccine for centuries. We focus in this exploratory R21 proposal on C15, the  B22 family member of ECTV. Deletion of C15 converts the virus from 100% lethal to 100% nonlethal in vivo  despite having no impact on replication in vitro. Our preliminary work with C15 has revealed two novel properties:  1) C15 potently and selectively inhibits CD4+ T cell activation in a way that inhibits assembly of the immunological  synapse. 2) In addition to targeting adaptive immunity, C15 also facilitates viral replication as early as 3 days  post infection, reflecting inhibition of innate immunity. Remarkably, C15 interferes with both RAG-dependent and  -independent components of innate immunity. Based on our preliminary data and the established literature, we  hypothesize that the RAG-independent component targeted by C15 is NK cell-mediated cytolysis and the RAG-  dependent component is bystander activation of memory CD8+ T cells (Trm). We further hypothesize that the  molecular target linking these two cell types is NKG2D, an activating receptor expressed by both NK cells and  Trm and shown previously to play an important role in defense against ECTV. Drawing from many years of  poxvirus experience and a wide range of established and cutting-edge techniques, we will test these three  hypotheses in three independent but complementary aims. Outcomes of this project could considerably enhance  understanding of orthopoxvirus pathogenesis and, more broadly, contribute to fundamental principles of  virus:host interplay. In addition, we anticipate that results will launch several subsequent projects including: a)  incorporation of CD4+ T cell inhibition in future mechanistic studies, b) examination of other B22 family members  and, c) the development of C15 derivatives for potential therapeutic modulation of host responses.",1,1b
P22083,Leveraging Zika virus driven myeloid cell responses to treat GBM,"Oncolytic viral therapy shows promise for high-grade solid tumors, but none have been shown to provide curative potential. This study explores the potential of harnessing the natural tropism of Zika virus (ZIKV) to target glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and reprogram the typically immune suppressive GBM tumor environment to an inflammatory, antigen-presenting environment that induces GBM-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The first goal of this proposal is to identify the cellular mechanisms that drive anti-tumor T cell responses following ZIKV treatment. Our research will examine the functional roles of two distinct myeloid cell subsets induced following ZIKV treatment - CCR2+ monocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and dendritic cell subset-2 (DC-2s) in draining lymph nodes (dLN) - in driving anti-tumor T cell responses against GBM. Additionally, our study will examine the synergistic therapeutic potential of a highly novel Flt3 ligand therapy and ZIKV combination therapy as a strategy to activate both dendritic cell subset-1 (DC-1s) and DC-2, to maximize anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses and subsequent GBM rejection. This research is significant because 1) it addresses the potential of ZIKV as an effective oncolytic virus for GBM treatment, 2) identifies key cellular mechanisms that contribute to its anti-tumor effects and 3) addresses the current failure of immunotherapy and maps a therapeutic path forward.",13,
C19789,"Rapid Research Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak: Development of Targeted Diagnostics, Therapeutics and Comparative Pathogenicity Assessment","In 2019, the world has seen the emergence of a virus that causes pneumonia in humans, which has a high probability of resulting in complications that include acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in an estimated 0.2% to 5% of cases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus endemic in wild animals that has adapted itself to infect humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named SARS-CoV-2, a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective antivirals against this virus. The virus is genetically similar to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS) and shares many disease features with influenza virus infections.   Our team will combine its multidisciplinary expertise to develop genetically engineered antibodies that can be used as therapeutics to limit the spread of the virus, as well as help identify the virus in patient samples. We will also develop a rapid genetic test for SARS-CoV-2 and measure the speed of genetic evolution of this virus compared to other coronaviruses that cause disease in humans such as SARS that caused the 2003 outbreak and the middle east respiratory syndrome virus (MERS). Finally, we will mass-produce the surface viral protein to enable the development of a prototype nasal-spray vaccine.","1, 6, 7","1a, 1c, 6a, 7a"
C06709,Provision of Clinical Data to Support a Nationwide COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative,"The unknown and changing characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have severely challenged theUnited States (U.S.) health care systems. The key to addressing many of these challenges is data andinformation sharing. To do this requires bringing together individual level health data from disparate systems intoa common structure that can be analyzed for answers to the important questions about COVID-19. Within the health informatics community there are two approaches to integrating data for analysis: (1)Federated data sharing which keeps the data at individual locations and allows for aggregated queries and (2)Harmonized repository that joins the data from the different sites into one database with a common data modelthat allows for individual or row level queries. While the federated approach is easier to implement and muchmore widely used, the harmonization approach is what is needed to address the challenges of the COVID-19pandemic since it will enable more impactful data analysis on the scientific questions surrounding this disease. The University of Virginia (UVA), the lead site for the cross-state integrated Translational Health ResearchInstitute of Virginia (iTHRIV), is well positioned to serve as an initial, pilot provider of data for the harmonized,analytic database being assembled by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)known as the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). There four reasons iTHRIV can do this at UVA: 1)iTHRIV has implemented the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model(CDM) and this is not only the accepted CDM for data transfer to N3C but it also the target data transfer modelfor N3C, which will make the iTHRIV CDM a good choice to validate data transforms; 2) The iTHRIV informaticsteam have been active participants in the development of the COVID-19 Phenotype implementation in OMOPand we can thus quickly implement the data queries; 3) The iTHRIV data Commons utilizes an architecture whichincludes multiple CDM and this gives us the capability to expand data acquisition to all partner institutions iniTHRIV and to rapidly respond to changes required in data acquisition and transfer; and 4) The University ofVirginia has an IRB Reliance Agreement in place with SMART IRB and can rely on any non-UVA IRB that alsohas an IRB Reliance Agreement with SMART IRB, which will streamline our start-up process for participation.iTHRIV at UVA therefore provides an ideal pilot site for the N3C project, and brings the iTHRIV Commons andthe iTHRIV partners institutions to rapidly support rapid expansion to other CDM as a model for the largerconsortium. The Commons also provides a leading team-science platform during the follow-on phases of N3Cwhere researchers within Virginia can collaborate with others from around the U.S. and the world to analyze thedata collected in centralized repository by the N3C project and address impactful health problems for thecommunity.",13,
P23759,Flexible Approaches to Support Health through financing,"One of the lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic is the importance of flexibility in funding and organization of health systems. European countries responded quickly to this extreme event, by expanding the amount of financial resources available for health care and reallocating financial and human resources. However, there are several other challenges for health care systems that require efficient and flexible financing mechanisms to be successfully addressed.   This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of health care financing mechanisms in Europe, by focusing on the two key stages of the process: i) budget allocation (e.g., among managing authorities, clinical areas), ii) financing of health services within a specific budget, through the definition of contracts and payment rules. We identify and examine the most prominent mechanisms underlying the relationship between the main challenges faced by health care systems (demand shocks, ageing, budget pressure) and their financing. By employing a wide range of methodological approaches, we provide evidence on the ability of existing financing mechanisms and contracts to address such challenges and study new solutions to achieve more effective, efficient and equitable health care systems.",11,11b
C06834,Adapting Coordinated Specialty Care in the Post COVID-19 Era,"Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs provide evidence-based services for young people withrecent onset of a psychotic disorder. New York State's program, OnTrackNY is a nationally recognized modelof CSC treatment. OnTrackNY provides coordinated, team-based services and has demonstratedimprovements in symptoms, functioning, hospitalization, and work/school participation. The rapid rise ofCOVID-19 has created shocks to the health care system, producing numerous rapid changes in behavioralhealth service delivery, including telehealth, in the absence of guidance from evidence or experience. It isunclear how these changes will impact the need for and delivery of psychiatric care and client outcomes. OnTrack Central, an intermediary organization responsible for training and implementation support ofOnTrackNY programs, has created systems for multi-level stakeholder engagement, a centralized datacollection protocol for quality improvement and evaluation of program fidelity, and a mechanism to supportpractice based-research. Our daily engagement of the OnTrackNY network has revealed how recent changesare dramatically impacting CSC services. In 2019, OnTrackNY was awarded a hub within the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) toadvance a learning health care system (LHS). The breadth of OnTrackNY sites coupled with OnTrack Centraloversight provides an opportunity to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in New York State. Thediversity of the 23 OnTrackNY teams located throughout the state enables examination of settings with highand low prevalence of COVID-19 infections and diverse regulatory and workforce environments. TheOnTrackNY network includes programs that operate within variable regulations (outpatient clinics at communityagencies, state-operated facilities, and community and academic hospitals in urban, suburban, and ruralareas) with very diverse participant populations. This project will examine the implications of modifications to service delivery within the OnTrackNY LHSduring and after the COVID-19 crisis. We will use the implementation science framework, Framework forReporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME) to systematically evaluate modifications madeand ascertain their impact. We will utilize integrative mixed methods, including qualitative interviews and focusgroups with stakeholders (clients, families, providers and decision makers at the state and local levels) andanalysis of OnTrackNY program data The project aims to assess: 1) the implications of governmental andagency level policy changes and how these decisions impact team staffing and functioning; 2) implications fordelivery of CSC services; and 3) impact on client-level care processes (e.g. utilization of services) andoutcomes. The goal is to develop a CSC Model Adaptation Guide that will be fidelity-consistent, andassociated with consistent engagement, service utilization or favorable outcomes of care.","9, 10, 11, 12","9e, 10a, 11e, 12c"
C09812,"Diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection, in different biological materials, in people infected with this virus","In general, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide occurs in the acute phase of the disease and through the identification of the virus in samples collected by nasopharyngeal swab and eventually saliva. Little is known about the presence of this agent in other biological materials and at different stages of the disease. Likewise, little is known about the association of the excretion of this agent in these secretions and the immune-humoral response. Clarifying this information could assist in understanding the natural history of the disease and assist in the diagnosis and management of these patients, clarifying important aspects of interpersonal, hospital and community transmission of this agent. Objectives 1 - Investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in a naso pharynx, saliva, urine, blood and feces swab, during the acute and convalescent phase of infection in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients; 2 - Investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva or naso-pharyngeal swab of contacts of patients with Covid-19; 3 - Correlate the presence of SARS-CoV 2 in these biological materials and the titers of neutralizing antibodies and IgG-type antibodies by ELISA; 4 - Investigate the SARS-CoV-2 permanence and infectivity rate in these patients during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19. Methodology - This is an observational, prospective study, to be carried out on patients and asymptomatic contacts of these patients, attended at the Hospital das Clínicas, USP Medical School, Cancer Institute of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and in the municipality of São Caetano do Sul, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 125 patients will be included, divided into 3 groups of patients: 1 - Symptomatic patients without diagnosis of any previous immunosuppression (50 patients); 2 - Symptomatic patients diagnosed with solid tumors or candidates for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (25 patients); 3 - Asymptomatic contacts of these patients (any group - 50 patients). Blood, urine, saliva, and naso pharyngeal and anal swabs will be collected for 5 consecutive weeks, with intervals of one week (days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28) starting up to 72 hours from the time of diagnosis in all patients in groups 1 and 2. For patients in group 3, only saliva and naso pharynx swab will be collected on day 1. For the detection of anti-SARS CoV 2 antibodies, ELISA serological techniques and the neutralization assay will be used. . For viral identification, molecular biology and viral culture techniques will be used. Duplex quantitative assays (internal control and N or E gene) for SARS-CoV-2 will be carried out according to adapted protocols, with the primers and probes for the real-time PCR assay.

C19781,"Providing insight into and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence, severity, complications, and long-term health effects of drug overdoses in people living with and without HIV in British Columbia, Canada.","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the ongoing drug toxicity and overdose (OD) crisis, resulting in an unprecedented rate of OD deaths in British Columbia (BC) since March 2020. People living with HIV (PLWH) have been disproportionately affected by substance use disorders and the ongoing OD crisis. As well, PLWH are at increased risk for negative indirect impacts of the pandemic, including increased levels of social isolation, loneliness, stress, anxiety, and substance use. More insight is needed in the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence of ODs, as well as the short and long-term health consequences of nonfatal ODs, in PLWH.   We aim to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal drug ODs, and on the direct and long-term health outcomes after a nonfatal overdose (NFOD) in people living with and without HIV. We will use routinely collected health data on all PLWH in BC and a random sample of 10% of the general population. First, we will compare the incidence of fatal and NFODs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, in people living with and without HIV. We will assess the severity of NFODs in terms of hospitalizations, complications, and duration of hospital stay. In addition, we will assess and compare trends in health care utilization and mortality in the six months after a nonfatal OD. Second, based on these analyses, and learning from the perspectives of community experts, health care providers, and policy makers, we will formulate recommendations for the care of PLWH who are at risk for or experienced an OD. These aim to reduce the risk for OD and adverse long-term health outcomes following a NFOD.  This study will provide essential insights into the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the coinciding OD crisis and HIV epidemic. These are urgently needed to inform targeted interventions to mediate the compounding effects of these three ongoing health crises.",10,10a
C18119,COVID 19 - Palliative and End of life Care experiences of people of African and Caribbean decent (PEACE),"Background End-of-Life-Care (EOLC) improves health-related quality of life and life-expectancy (1), despite this one in four UK families miss out on crucial support particularly those from Ethnic Minorities groups (2-5). Research into EOLC for Ethnic Minorities is out-dated, out-with the UK, or from London, where Ethnic Minorities make up over 40% of the population (5-9). We know nothing of EOLC experiences of Ethnic Minorities in areas of the UK where they are more disparate, despite national research calls for such information (5). Key research policy priorities are to promote equity in EOLC, specifically to rectify ""poor outcomes amongst Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations"" (8-12). BAME groups are heterogeneous. Older Black people are a crucial tracer population for achieving patient-preferred outcomes, and they experience some of the highest levels of material disadvantage (5,10-12). During the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths amongst Black populations have been twice as high as in White populations of similar socioeconomic status (13). Despite this Black people are still less likely to access end-of-life services (10,14-17), which play a crucial role in improving care (18). It is unclear why this is and how service changes have exacerbated this. Aims and objectives To identify family priorities for EOLC development, to meet the needs of Black people during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We will explore family and patient (by proxy) views on; experiences of EOLC (positive/negative), barriers to EOLC and how EOLC could better meet Black people s needs. Methods We will conduct a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Bereaved relatives of decedents (>50 years) who identified as being Black African, Black Caribbean or Black other (13) and who died during the COVID-19 pandemic will be recruited/purposively sampled through community groups, social media and targeted online advertising (23). The sample will be balanced by relationship, gender-identity, age and decedent s illness (COVID-19/cancer/non-cancer). Previous experience suggests no more than 60 interviews will be required to ensure data sufficiency. Interviews will be conducted following COVID-19 guidelines. The topic guide, developed with PPI partners and drawing on VOICES survey domains (19), will allow participants to share their experiences. Prompts will elicit information about needs (met/unmet), experiences/views, support structures and barriers to care. We will use a modified theoretical framework of access and critical race theory which consider service availability, accommodation, affordability, acceptability and awareness (20-23). Policy engagement, dissemination and impact Our research will support policymakers to accommodate recent changes in service, whilst addressing structural, cultural and behavioural challenges to equitable EOLC. The team will undertake targeted dissemination of emerging findings, including 10-minute COVID-19 webinars and existing monthly Department of Health and Social Care/Policy Research Unit meetings from March 2021 until November 2021. We will also present findings to the National Clinical Director for End-of-Life and the National End-of-Life Care Intelligence Network. We will deliver three main outputs: A formal report and briefing of findings, following a 1/3/25 page format, for policy makers (November 2021), an article in peer-reviewed journal (December 2021); and public-facing report developed for bereaved relatives/carers (November 2021).","4, 8, 9","4c, 8c, 9b"
C02371,Covid-19 and Investor Stewardship: The Need for Responsible Ownership in a Time of Emergency,"Institutional investors, who control the savings of millions of ordinary people, have a key role to play in ensuring that the companies in which they invest maintain high standards of governance and accountability. Investor stewardship - the responsible allocation of capital and purposeful engagement - has particular relevance here. The global coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic - and the response to it - has impacted businesses worldwide and revealed a series of short, medium- and long-term environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks. This project will examine how the Covid-19 outbreak has impacted stewardship activities in the UK and ask questions about the social function of institutional investors and their leadership in ESG practices.

C06192,NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Improving Health in Slums at University of Warwick,"This unit will be led by the Warwick International Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery (W-CAHRD), University of Warwick (UoW). Its staff and facilities will form the foundation of the proposed unit. W-CAHRD was set up in 2014 with core UoW investment, in line with the institution's strategic aim to increase international collaboration and support world-class global health research. Since inception, W-CAHRD has won 21 externally funded research projects worth £12.8 million and published 100+ peer reviewed global health papers, including a Lancet series on health in slums2,3. UoW provides core funding for a Global Research Priorities (GRP) programme to address the most challenging problems facing the world and to provide a platform for interdisciplinary research. W-CAHRD is represented on the programme and addresses 3 of the GRP's 11 themes: sustainable cities, health and international development. UoW will contribute matched funds and support unit sustainability (see justification of costs).     Our unit will focus on how health services are delivered and used in slums, home to nearly a billion people, and identify options to improve affordable access for this group. Access to healthcare is a critical barrier to improved health in LMICs4. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a key element of the current global health agenda. It requires a set of physically accessible and financially affordable service providers, and a reduced burden of out-of-pocket expenditure5. All UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve UHC by 2030. Studying disease epidemiology is unhelpful if infrastructure is not in place to address it6. In the context of rapid urbanisation, poor economic growth, urban planning and regulation, slum populations are increasing. Slums, generally situated near to urban centres, are often physically closer to health services than rural settlements. Despite this, people in slums can have poorer health outcomes than their rural counterparts. This is due to the hazardous slum environment and poor access to appropriate healthcare2. In this vulnerable and marginalised group, child and maternal mortality remain high, as do infectious disease deaths, while non-communicable disease risk is growing2,7. Health emergencies are magnified in the slum environment. In the recent Ebola epidemic, the disease was concentrated in slums, and infected residents facilitated transmission throughout the city8. Poor people in LMICs are prone to catastrophic financial loss if they fall ill, and in slums, out of pocket expenses are essential to maintain life (e.g. to buy clean water)9. Observational studies of maternity care in Nairobi have documented a near absence of public facilities in slums. Private providers of varying quality fill the void8. Just 13.9% of people living in Dhaka's slums seek care from modern public providers, and coverage gaps exist10,11. Fragmented services may lead to poor co-ordination of care, reducing efficiency and resilience e.g. over-provision and/or under-provision of some services; reduced continuity of care; increased probability of developing drug resistance; reduced opportunities for disease surveillance. In slums, proximity to urban centres and population density mean that improvements to health service delivery could benefit many people simultaneously and have a large impact on health in LMICs. Our unit will seek to advance this issue.     Objectives:   Short-term To map geo-spatially current health service delivery arrangements and understand patterns of health service use (including equity of use) in slums in major and secondary cities.   Medium-term To identify costs associated with different models of health service delivery arrangements in these slums, including by whom costs are incurred.   Long-term To model options for health service delivery in slums, considering quality, cost-effectiveness and equity of provision. To develop capacity, communities of practice and a sustained research programme which exceeds the lifetime of the unit.   Throughout To identify, synthesise and curate literature on potential models of health service delivery relevant to the slum context. To engage decision-makers and users in designing models of health service delivery in slums, with a view to subsequent evaluation of effectiveness and costs of viable options.     To achieve the objectives work will be structured in 5 packages (WPs see Fig2,3). We have identified primary study sites, located in Kenya, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Pakistan (Fig1). These sites provide variety in social and physical factors, allowing us to examine diverse existing models of healthcare delivery. WP1: Geo-spatial mapping of health services in slums (Years 1-2). a)We will create accurate maps of the slums using participatory mapping instruments that combine local information to 'ground truth' data generated from Earth-observation satellite imagery. This methodology has worked in slums, with lay groups collecting data for the purposes of informing humanitarian aid organisations12. These maps have 2 functions: they will form the basis on which to overlay geo-spatial data on health service location (see b); they will inform our sampling frame in WP2. b)Local participatory mapping will be used to identify and add all health services present in the slum or available to people living in the slum to our maps, including hospitals, clinics, traditional healers, pharmacies etc. With our augmented map, we can calculate the area covered by mapped facilities and identify blind spots ; areas that are not covered or have a high distance/travel time to existing services. WP2: Household survey of health service use by slum residents (Years 1-2). A survey of health service use will be conducted with a stratified random sample of people living in the examined slums. Health service use will be investigated using questions adapted from a validated questionnaire (e.g.13). We will ask where healthcare has been sought by participants over the past year; for what health conditions; unmet healthcare needs; satisfaction with care received (a facet of 'quality'); and associated costs, including out-of-pocket costs. Data will be cross-referenced with WP1 to identify health services used by people living in the slums that are not recorded in the mapping, such as informal providers working from unmarked premises, services delivered at home (e.g. by community health workers) and those delivered outside the slums (e.g. secondary or tertiary care which is likely to be exclusively outside the slum area). Surveys will be georeferenced, so we can examine distance/travel time to health services. We will use Slum Dweller Association collected data14 to augment our findings. WP3: Curation and synthesis of the literature on models of health service delivery relevant to the slum context (Years 1-4). We will perform systematic reviews and overviews of the literature concerning relevant models of health service delivery with specific reference to delivery arrangements as defined in Lavis's taxonomy of structures and implementation strategies within health systems15. WP4: Simulation-based interactive design of optimal service models (Years 2-3). We will draw on insights from WP1-3 to develop simulation models representing alternative approaches to slum health service delivery. These will be used to evaluate affordability and efficiency of services as they currently operate, and provide a policy tool to predict the impact of adopting new approaches, or improving the organisation of existing ones, including estimates of resilience to seasonal or unexpected (e.g. conflict or epidemic related) demand surges. Models will take a broad economic perspective, populated by health service resource use data collected from providers identified in WP1, and patient/ household costs identified in WP2. We will estimate cost-effectiveness by modelling the impact of service configuration on health outcomes as far as possible given available data. The models will allow us to estimate the impact and value-for-money of existing and proposed service configurations, taking affordability and logistical constraints into account, in line with WHO Choosing Interventions that are Cost Effective (WHO-CHOICE) methodology16.The idea is to design optimal services according to resource and staff available and to provide a pathway of improvements, including the option of improving technical efficiency of existing models. WP5: Engaging stakeholders and implementing viable options for health service delivery in slums (Years 1-4). A series of workshops with stakeholders such as healthcare commissioners, providers and people who live in slums will be held in the cities studied. In year 1, workshops will seek to understand local policy-drivers, questions and concerns of local people relevant to the work and develop and prioritise research questions to be addressed by the unit. Year 4 workshops will examine viable models of health service delivery in slums informed by the evidence gathered in WP1-4. E.g. printed maps will facilitate discussion on the optimal location of future services; simulation models will provide a decision aid. WP5 will culminate with formulation of an action plan to implement favoured models of care with selected commissioners or providers of health services. Opportunities for pilot evaluation studies will be examined. While WPs are specified above, we have capacity to respond to emerging global health research requirements. Notably: WP3 is designed to be flexible to allow evidence synthesis activity to support our developing work programme; specific PhD projects will evolve in response to stakeholder priorities (including those of our academic partners) explicated in Year 1 workshops; in years 3-4 we have allocated flexible researcher time to exploit data collected and methodology developed, and to pursue promising leads arising during years 1-2.","9, 11","9a, 11a, 11b"
C10736,Developing a novel vaccine against COVID-19,"The emergence of life-threatening human respiratory viral pathogens such as SARS-Cov, MERS, and current SARS-Cov-2 present an intense challenge to clinicians who are left with no available therapeutic interventions and scientists who must rapidly develop novel therapies in the midst of a pandemic.  Individuals with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2, exhibit a range of symptoms ranging from mild cough to acute respiratory failure. While most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop only mild disease, infection can be fatal in vulnerable populations, including the elderly. Although the global scientific community is working together to find treatments to stop the outbreak, there are currently no therapeutic approaches that prevent or mitigate SARS-CoV2 infection. Clearly, developing a vaccine that improves the early immune response to infection and prevents disease progression is required to end this pandemic. The goal of our studies is to establish new vaccine approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or minimize disease sequelae. Using preclinical animal models, unique clinical human samples collected from COVID-19 patients or individuals with specific vaccination histories, we will test the efficacy of our vaccination strategies against virulent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within this framework, we will use two major complementary approaches to enhance immunity against COVID19. Our studies will provide new insight into how we can harness the power of our immunity to improve vaccines and human health. If successful, these vaccine strategies can be rapidly deployed to the general population to bring an end to this and potentially future COVID-19 outbreaks.",7,7a
C04318,"Trust, Acceptance and Sufficiency: Law as a Barrier to, and Enabler of, Routine and Responsive Immunization including COVID-19A","Primary disease prevention through immunization is a global public health priority with clear economic and health and well-being benefits. However, there is growing recognition in Canada that vaccine uptake rates are not where they need to be for adequate control of vaccine preventable diseases. Importantly, these rates can be further eroded by unanticipated disruptive events such as a pandemic for which there is yet no vaccine (e.g., COVID-19). While control of COVID-19 will be more feasible once vaccine(s) become available, this will not be a simple decision federally or for the provinces and territories as it is highly probable that different types of COVID-19 vaccines will be available in Canada which differ as to safety and efficacy parameters, age targets, etc. While practice/program decisions need to be based on sound scientific evidence, legal considerations relevant to program design and delivery will frequently arise. For example, consider cases in which there are differences between manufacturer license recommendations and effective case- and conditions-sensitive use by and within programs.     This project is a first step in gaining a better understanding of immunization, both routine and responsive i.e. in a pandemic, as a 'regulated space' . Laws may both help and may also hinder. The project will generate significant new insights into the content and scope of immunization governance frameworks ( laws and regulations) that exist across Canada, offering observations about their potential as barriers to, and enablers of, public health goals, with special attention to two issues that COVID-19 has already highlighted as problematic, namely the issues of mandates and vaccine injury compensation. The ultimate aim is to assist in identifying what might be done for Canada to perform better in this setting, taking into account its actions in response to COVID-19.","9, 11","9d, 11e"

A5418 (STOMP) is a study of tecovirimat (also known as TPOCC) for the treatment of human monkeypox virus (HMPXV) disease.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the antiviral tecovirimat, also known as TPOXX, for the treatment of human monkeypox infection. The NIAID-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is leading the study, which is now enrolling adults and children with monkeypox infection in the United States. Study investigators aim to enroll more than 500 people from up to 80 clinical research sites nationwide.  Adults with severe monkeypox, severe immunodeficiency, or severe inflammatory skin conditions; individuals taking certain medications that could affect tecovirimat levels; and pregnant people, people who are breastfeeding and children all will be enrolled in an open-label arm in which all participants receive tecovirimat. Other adult participantsÃ¢Â€Â""530 totalÃ¢Â€Â""will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive tecovirimat or placebo pills, which participants will take for 14 days. This part of the trial is double-blind, meaning neither participants nor investigators will know who is receiving placebo or tecovirimat.  Investigators will gather data to determine if participants receiving tecovirimat heal more quickly and have less pain compared with those taking placebo. Participants will be followed for at least 57 days and will be asked to fill out a symptom diary, do daily skin checks at home and attend virtual and in-person clinic appointments. They also will undergo physical exams and will be asked to provide blood and other bodily fluid samples, including swabbing fluid from their lesions.  Data on the safety and efficacy of tecovirimat will be submitted to the FDA. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor participant safety throughout the duration of the study. In addition, any participant in the randomized cohort who progresses to severe disease will be unblinded and given tecovirimat if they were randomized to placebo.",6,6e

C06759,Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement),"PROJECT Summary: Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction thatauthentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) iscritical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. Thisincludes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially forhaving health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and publichealth (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent onmaking effective use of scientific data from multiple domains.The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity toprogress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and theCenters for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and otherpartnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinicaldata related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means ofaccelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics,therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency andaccessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives ofTufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research byproviding innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greaterexchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing. In-line with shared objectives, in this supplement we seek to contribute to the N3C initiative as adata provider and thought partner through the following specific aims: (1) continue to play animportant role providing tools and resources for N3C's analytics platform; and (2) ensure TuftsCTSI's Informatics Program has sufficient staff and technical resources to continue to provideCOVID-specific patient data from our hub to the N3C repository.",13,
C06351,Clinical Trial for Bradykinin Inhibition in Adults Hospitalized with Serious COVID-19,"The pandemic of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) has already been confirmed in more than 330 thousand people, being responsible for more than 14 thousand deaths worldwide (World Health Organization - official data of 23 March 2020). The current treatment for severe cases is based on respiratory support, use of a variety of antibiotics with possible extracorporeal oxygenation; however, the results are still unsatisfactory. Researchers have shown that the virus binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ECA2) to gain access to cells. This enzyme is essential in the inactivation of Angiotensin II (ANGII) and bradykinin. The accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common effect after the use of ACE inhibitors with a consequent increase in cough. In studies with animal models, inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe pneumonitis after administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and inhibition of bradykinin completely restores lung function and structure. As pneumonia is the most intense condition and a marker of disease progression, our hypothesis is that the increase in bradykinin is the main link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and ACE2 inhibition resulting in a severe respiratory syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of two pharmacological inhibitors of bradykinin, the C1 esterase / kallikrein inhibitor (Berinert®, CSL Behring GmbH) and the bradykinin receptor 2 inhibitor, icatibant (Firazyr®, Shire) in critically ill patients hospitalized for SARS -CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: This is an open randomized clinical trial to be carried out at Hospital de Clínicas, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil. One hundred and eighty patients will be divided in a 1: 1: 1 ratio to receive: i, the basic support established by published clinical trials, which include oxygen support, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, use of antibiotics, use of vasopressors and therapy renal support; or, ii, Berinert, 20 U / Kg intravenously, one dose on the day of inclusion in the study and one dose on the fourth day; patients in this group will receive the same basic support procedure offered to the control group; iii, Firazyr, 30 mg subcutaneously 8/8 h for four days; patients in this group will receive the same basic support procedure offered to the control group. The primary end points are, complete recovery with hospital discharge or death; monitoring will be done for 28 days. The inclusion criteria will be: men and women aged 18 years or older with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2; pneumonia confirmed by computed tomography (CT) of the chest; oxygen saturation in ambient air of 94% or less. Exclusion criteria: Pregnant or lactating women; patients with severe liver disease (alanine aminotransferase and / or aspartate aminotransferase> 5x above normal); severe nephropathy (kidney transplant or dialysis), HIV infection, cancer, hereditary angioedema, other immunodeficiencies, past myocardial ischemic disease, past thromboembolic disease.

C03059,Indigenous Health Counts in Urban Homelands: Estimating COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality among Indigenous Populations Living in Ontario Cities,"First Nations, Inuit, and Metis peoples face many challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to existing social factors such as poor quality, overcrowded housing, homelessness, and lack of clean running water, infections like COVID-19 can spread quickly. There are also big gaps in data about how COVID-19 is spreading among Indigenous peoples, especially in cities. To address this, we will use information from existing studies about the health of Indigenous peoples living in cities to learn more about COVID-19 spread and it's impacts.  The Our Health Counts Toronto, London and Thunder Bay studies used social networks to find Indigenous community members living in these cities. These studies were done by the Indigenous community for the Indigenous community. Our methods allowed us to gather information about the needs of the entire Indigenous populations in these cities, even those who don't use services regularly. By linking the Our Health Counts studies to the provincial COVID-19 database at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), our team will use new statistical methods to accurately estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission for Indigenous peoples in these cities. We will also check for increases in mortality rates, due both to COVID-19 itself and gaps in access to health care for acute (e.g. heart attack) and chronic (e.g. diabetes) health conditions.  In partnership with Indigenous community health services, our research team will improve statistical methods and produce currently unavailable information regarding the burden of COVID-19 and its rate of spreading through the urban Indigenous communities living in Toronto, London and Thunder Bay, Ontario.  This information is important as Indigenous Peoples are highly mobile between urban areas and First Nations reserves, and rural and remote Metis and Inuit communities.  Improving our understanding of COVID-19 in urban centres can reduce its risk of spreading within and from these cities.",3,"3a, 3b"
C00900,Studies on the effects of colchicine on neutrophil biology in acute myocardial infarction,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes the highly contagious coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a global pandemic. COVID-19 cases in the New York City (NYC) tri-statearea continue to rise exponentially and the region is now the epicenter of the crisis in the United States. InNYC alone, there are over 21,000 cases (~40% ≥40 years of age) as of March 26, 2020. Many symptomaticCOVID-19 patients have features of a cytokine storm and/or macrophage activation syndrome, includingelevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6. An overly robust local neutrophil influx may also contribute to the robustimmune response with associated severe cardiopulmonary complications, including acute respiratory distresssyndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Colchicine is a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby blockingconversion of pro-IL-1β to active IL-1β, which leads to secondary reductions in other cytokines including IL-6along with inhibition of macrophage activation. Colchicine also preferentially accumulates in neutrophilscompared with other inflammatory cells and inhibits chemotaxis, endothelial adhesion, and extravasation ofneutrophils at sites of endothelial or tissue inflammation. The effects of colchicine in preventing the cytokinestorm and/or macrophage activation syndrome that leads to clinical deterioration in COVID-19, however, is notknown. Colchicine is not known to inhibit acquired immunity, and is not contraindicated in patients withinfection.The COLCORONA study is a Canadian government-funded randomized trial of colchicine vs. placebo for 30days in 6,000 non-hospitalized subjects 40 years of age with COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one high-riskcriterion. This proposal leverages the COLCORONA Trial infrastructure and pragmatic study design with virtualconsent, randomization, and follow-up to rapidly implement the COLCORONA-NYC Study and allow potentialeligible subjects in the NYC tri-state area to participate. The overall aim of the study is to determine the effectof colchicine on the composite of death or the need for hospitalization in non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The data collected through the COLCORONA-NYC study will provide novel data on treatment of COVID-19patients, and have public health implications beyond the scope of the current application, including thepotential reduction in the healthcare resources heavily used in COVID-19 (e.g., hospital beds, ventilators), andpotential future use in other infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.",6,6g

P23177,Insight into the Ebola virus glycoprotein fusion mechanism gleaned from the 2013-2016 epidemic GP-A82V variant,"The 2013Ã¢Â€Â""2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic was orders of magnitude larger than any previous EBOV outbreak. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V, an EBOV glycoprotein mutant that came to dominate the outbreak, increases infectivity in human cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases infectivity, and to clarify its significance for Ebola virus replication and transmission, we have assembled a team that leverages NIAID resources at the IRF-Fort Detrick and the Genomic Center for Infectious Diseases at The Broad Institute. Aim 1 will be to investigate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases virion fusogenicity. Computer modeling suggests that GP-A82V destabilizes glycoprotein conformation. Mutations engineered based on the models will be tested for effects on infectivity, the reorganization of critical interactions as determined by molecular dynamics simulations, conformational equilibrium as determined by smFRET, novel assays for GP fusion, Cryo-EM of GP trimers, and crystal complexes with the NPC1 C-loop. Aim 2 will be to assess the effect of GP-A82V in the context of the EBOV Makona variant on infectivity in human cells in vitro and in humanized mice. We will generate a reverse genetic system for the ancestral EBOV Makona lineage and test the effect of GP-A82V on this background. Replication of WT and GP-A82V will be compared in U20S cells, in human dendritic cells, and in a novel humanized mouse model where the effect of GP-A82V on virus sequence adaptation to specific tissue compartments will be assessed. From these experiments we expect to clarify the significance of GP-A82V for viral replication and transmission, taking into account the genetic background of the EBOV and the species-specific effects of GP-A82V. Aim 3 will be to examine the effect of GP-A82V on neutralizing antibodies. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V is relatively resistant to neutralization by particular antibodies. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of GP, we will determine whether neutralization resistance is a general property of GP-A82V, or if this trait is specific to antibodies targeting particular regions of GP. If differential neutralization is observed with particular antibodies, the effect of these on viral titer will be tested in the humanized mouse model. We will also determine whether GP-A82V alters neutralization sensitivity to convalescent sera from Guineans infected early or later in the outbreak, and from individuals treated at Emory University. From these studies we hope to determine whether the antibody response to EBOV was different depending on whether a person was infected with virus bearing GP-A82 or GP-A82V. If differences in neutralization titer correlate with virus genotype it would contribute to understanding the factors that determine survival in an infected individual or the efficiency of transmission to people who come into contact with infected body fluids. Finally, these studies will provide valuable experimental tools that will inform our studies on GP structure and function.",1,"1b, 1c, 1d"
P23421,"Fostering inclusive science, technology and innovation systems in Central America through strengthening capacities on open science","According to the 2021 Global Sustainable Development Report, strong science, technology and innovation (STI) systems are foundational to inclusive development and to restarting progress on the SDGs, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) investments in public research and development have stalled or decreased since the start of the pandemic.     A second challenge is that existing funds are rarely deployed towards long-term investments in regional collaboration through research and capacity strengthening of STI systems, particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Third, establishing strong national science structures in LAC, including science granting councils (SGCs), has been hindered by budget shortfalls, high civil-service turnover, public distrust in science, and political instability. Lastly, while SGCs in the region recognize the gender imbalances that remain in key fields at various levels, capacity gaps continue to hinder the formulation of policies that support gender inclusive STI agendas, placing women and excluded groups at the forefront of leading and benefiting from robust science systems.     This project, selected through an open competitive call, is a significant investment by IDRC aimed to support more inclusive STI systems in Central America by strengthening the capacities of regional science bodies, particularly SGCs, to implement open science policies and practices within their agendas and to support regional coordination towards high quality research and innovation. To achieve this objective, selected partners will do a cross-regional analysis of open science policies, identify best practices for the Central American context, bring together key STI stakeholders across sectors to jointly develop a regional policy on open science and mobilize the development of more sustainable collaboration mechanisms, and sustainably strengthen capacities of key STI actors to implement the agreed upon policy.

C19644,Effects of COVID-19 on South Asian Mothers and Families in BC,"Women have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mothers in particular are simultaneously managing paid employment, household work, homeschooling and/or childcare. The impact has been particularly severe for South Asian mothers in Canada, who often experienced further stressors such as language barriers, caring for elderly relatives, and transnational economic and social responsibilities. South Asian women and their family members are often at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 as they are more likely to work in employment sectors with greater exposure to the virus. They have also been more severely affected by job loss during the pandemic as they are over-represented in hard-hit industries such as food and accommodation services. Finally, South Asian women have faced increased racial prejudice, often being falsely blamed for the pandemic, (particularly as the Delta variant, initially inappropriately labelled the ""Indian variant"", quickly became a widespread variant of concern).  To date there is limited knowledge on the health, psychosocial and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers in Canadian South Asian communities, and how these impacts affect their families. We will examine South Asian mothers' COVID-19 experiences (including positive supports) and levels of moral distress using a longitudinal mixed method approach (interviews and questionnaires/surveys). Moral distress is defined as a phenomenon in which a person knows the right action to take, but is constrained from taking it because of barriers beyond their control. The experiences of South Asian mothers during the pandemic potentially contribute to cumulative moral distress. This research will be conducted in the Fraser Health Region of BC. Collaborations with provincial knowledge users and community organization partners will ensure their information needs are met and the resulting recommendations can be readily translated into changes in policy and practice.",10,"10b, 10d"

P21647,Live-attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccines:  comparative mechanisms of trans-placental transmission and vaccine efficacy for developing fetuses,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The World Health Organization warns of a pending public health emergency caused by mosquito-borne  zoonotic pathogen Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The consequences of this emerging virus could be  exacerbated by insufficient vaccines for prevention of infection and disease. RVF is an important  agroeconomic illness of domesticated livestock and is endemic in Africa and parts of the Middle East. Further  spread is likely given that mosquito species capable of transmitting RVFV are found in Europe and the  Americas. The most striking feature of RVF disease in sheep is a wave of fetal loss (known as an Ã¢Â€Âœabortion  stormÃ¢Â€Â) that sweeps through herds of pregnant animals, where spontaneous abortion rates can reach as high  as 90%. Vaccination of livestock protects animals while simultaneously reducing the spread of RVFV to  people. Obstacles in the successful development of RVFV livestock vaccines include: 1) vaccine strains often  cause fetal infection and death in pregnant animals, and 2) vaccines that protect adult animals from disease  are not always effective at preventing vertical transmission during pregnancy. These hurdles represent a major  gap in the vaccine development field. The mechanisms by which live-attenuated vaccine strains of RVFV are  vertically transmitted in utero, as well as the maternal immune response required for the protection of  developing fetuses, are not known. No systematic evaluation of the vertical transmission potential of clinically-  relevant live attenuated vaccines has been performed. To address this gap in the field, we propose to use an  experimental rodent model of RVFV vertical transmission and fetal death in late-gestation pregnant rats. RVFV  directly infects the placenta in rats, causes hemorrhage and inflammation, and results in fetal malformations  including intrauterine fetal death even in pregnant dams without signs of disease. This proposal will use the  pregnant rat model to test current RVF vaccine candidates for the mechanism(s) of vertical transmission, fetal  protection, and identification of maternal immune correlates of fetal protection. We will also conduct a  comparative analysis of virulent and attenuated RVFV strains for permissivity of placental explants from  relevant species to identify cellular and structural targets of infection. Our overall hypothesis is that infection of  pregnant rats with RVFV live-attenuated vaccines will provide pre-clinical quantitative data on vaccine safety  for developing fetuses, efficacy for the fetuses, and critical maternal correlates of fetal protection. Completion  of these studies will change the paradigm of RVFV vaccine development by providing, for the first time, a  mechanistic explanation for the vertical transmission potential of clinically relevant LAVs.","1, 2","1e, 2a, 2y"

P23762,Building future through an innovated and digital skilled hospital,"Throughout the most recent years, the world has been facing troubling times in what concerns health issues and crisis situations. Consequently, a growing awareness is happening so that these types of circumstances can be mitigated or avoided. The COVID-19 pandemic showed, on the one hand, how fragile the overall health systems are but, on the other hand, how resilient health professionals can be. Nevertheless, there is a clear need to give these professionals tools to stay alert and deal with situations like this one in the best way possible. As Confucius said, 'ÄúLearn as if you were not reaching your goal and as though you were scared of missing it'Äù. In this context, we believe that only a combination of a triple-front training of the health workforce (soft, ICT and hard skills) and knowledge sharing will be the beginning that leads to a better planning and management of crisis situations, patient-oriented health modules and surge capacity.    Having this in mind, a European taskforce was gathered to create training modules that would facilitate further education processes for staff working in the medical sector, that includes regular strengthening and updating knowledge in medicine. Additionally, the project aims to provide training in the field of emotional resilience and digital skills that become relevant in crisis situations. It is our intention not only to boost international cooperation in health, but also to strengthen national health systems through the development of digital tools and services, digital transformation of healthcare, and improving soft and hard skills of clinical and non-clinical healthcare professionals at the European level.",11,11f
C03796,ADE-minimized COVID-19 vaccine via epitope focusing and anti-inflammatory innate immunity,"Project Summary  Although over 100 COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development worldwide in response to the global publichealth emergency, most or all may suffer from the liability of eliciting anti-viral-spike antibodies (Abs) thatenhance (ADE) either viral infection or COVID-19 disease, upon exposure of vaccinees to circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This phenomenon was observed previously in humans for respiratory syncytial viruses and inpreclinical studies for the closely related SARS and MERS viruses. Notably, none of these viruses currently have a licensed effective and safe vaccine available despite 15 (SARS) to 60 (RSV) years of effort by the scientific community. These facts raise the alarming possibility that all current COVID-19 vaccines that are not rationally designed to avoid ADE may fail, perpetuating the current global health emergency and erodingconfidence in vaccines and in the medical scientific community. Many COVID-19 patients experience near-fatal or fatal immunopathologic ""storms"" in lung, heart and bloodstarting at 7-14 days after onset of symptoms, which is approximately when the antibody response to the virusis rising or peaking. This suggests that immunopathologic ADE of disease enhancement in humans in the current emergency cannot be ignored in vaccine design. A few of the current vaccine candidates take a small step towards avoidance of ADE by restricting vaccine immunogens to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor bindingdomain (RBD), which is theorized to avoid ADE by minimizing immune complex formation without sacrificingvirus neutralization epitopes. Others seek to steer the immune system away from harmful, pro-inflammatoryvaccine responses using viral vectors and adjuvants.     We propose to develop a unique vaccine in the pandemic that goes all the way down this road to incorporate only a single, neutralization, B-cell epitope, thereby maximally avoiding both ADE of viral infection and ADE of disease, as well as testing the ALVAC-alum platform we have previously validated for HIV to steer immunity towards a less inflammatory, protective state. Leveraging Rhesus macaques that are already purchased (no cost to this project for purchase), we will produce and test the protection afforded by the single, neutralization, B-cell epitope (Aim 1) as well as theimmune response to the ALVAC-alum platform (Aim 2). The results may set the stage for a rapidly manufactured vaccine to emergently fill the ADE gap in the current COVID-19 vaccine landscape.",7,7a

C06857,Action of SARS CoV2 in Human Brain Cultures,"PROJECT Summary: There is emerging evidence that SARS-CoV2 or COVID19 gains entry into human brain cells leading to asequela of neurologic symptoms. There is concern that SARS-CoV2 may lead to neurotoxicity and thatneuronal death in the regions of the brain that control respiration and cardiac function may be a contributingfactor to the acute loss of cardio respiratory function and death. SARS-CoV2 could gain access to the brain byseveral routes including through the nose, or neurons innervating infected lung tissue or through the cells liningblood capillaries in the brain. COVID-19 patients lose their sense of smell or taste often before the onset ofrespiratory symptoms and a patient presented with Guillain-Barré syndrome before testing positive for SARS-CoV2. It appears that at least 36% of COVID19 patients had neurologic manifestations including headache,nausea, loss of consciousness, strokes, confusion, encephalitis, meningitis and seizures. These clinicalobservations strongly indicate a role for SARS-CoV2 in the death of neurons and importantly the brain may beone of the first tissues infected and affected. The actions of SARS-CoV2 on the different cells in the brain, aswell as the infectivity, tropism, and replication in brain cells is not yet known. In this application we propose toevaluate: (1) The tropism and replication of SARS-CoV2 in human microglia, astrocytes, neurons, anddetermine relative susceptibility? (2) The mechanisms of cellular injury and evaluate potential protectiveapproaches. (3) Determine the transcriptional responses to SARS CoV2 infection in human neurons,astrocytes, and microglia at the single cell level to gain new insight into the differential response of brain cellsto SARS CoV2 to better understand the neural deficits the virus causes.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

Using and improving state-of-the-art OoCs and Digital Biomarkers (for physiology and biomarkers in interstitial fluid) we will measure detailed response to viral infection. By closely monitoring the response with wearable multi-modal Edge AI patches, we aim to predict in near real-time the progression of the disease, support early clinical decision and to propose patient-specific therapy using existing drugs. We will combine scientific and technical excellence in a highly multi- and inter-disciplinary project, bringing together medical, biological, electronical, computer, signal processing and social science communities around Europe to setup Digital Twin at Edge. We will enable an Edge-to-Cloud vision, significantly advancing current state of the art and setting up a new European community for researching and applying Digital Twins.",4,"4a, 4b, 4c"
C06814,Chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 system and synthetic cathinones,"Human death in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for the covid-19pandemic) is caused by barriers dysfunction (i.e. in the pulmonary system). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2,similarly to other coronaviruses. Surface expression of ACE2 protein was found on lungalveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. In brain, ACE2 is expressed onendothelial cells, a major component of blood-brain barrier (BBB). We propose to perform aseries of studies to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on BBB function in thepresence of cocaine as an extension of our funded research on psychostimulants and theCXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine system. First, a comprehensive series of experiments on theimpact of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the presence and absence of cocaine on brainmicrovascular endothelial cells will be performed in vitro to inform on the cellular and molecularmechanism involved in altered BBB function. Included in the analysis will be measurements ofcytosolic Ca2+ levels, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, tight junctions and cytoskeletalproteins. Second, integrated fluorescence microscopy will be used to visualize and quantifychanges in BBB permeability in real time in awake rats after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spikeprotein. The impact of acute and chronic administration of cocaine on BBB function in thesetting of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein will be determined. Finally, brain regions from ratsexposed to cocaine and the spike protein will be examined for levels of pro-inflammatorycytokines and chemokines. Taken together, this series of experiments will provide novelinformation about the effect of the spike protein on BBB function and neuroinflammation, and itspotential interactions with cocaine. We hypothesize that chronic cocaine exposure willexacerbate the negative impact of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on BBB integrity and increasepro-inflammatory mediators in the CNS. These studies will provide the necessary groundwork toembark on a larger study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on cocaine behaviors and toxicities.","1, 4","1b, 4b"
C07772,Wastewater epidemiology using SARS-CoV-2 as an example biomarker to assess COVID-19 infections at a population scale (Biomarker CoV2),"In the recent past, there is increasing interest in using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a  diagnostic tool to assess the consumption of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals across an entire sewershed.  In the ongoing pandemic, even SARS-CoV-2 could be used as a biomarker as part of WBE to detect not  only early changes in the infection pattern, to estimate the number of COVID-19 infected people with  asymptomic effects, but also to assess the overall infection pattern in a community including the efficacy of  counter measures. The main goals of this study are a) the development of quantitative methods for the  identification of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in raw sewage, b) a comprehensive assessment of the  infection pattern at a population level using WBE based on a novel SARS-CoV-2 biomarker model, c) the  development and validation of strategies to identify local infection hot spots in a community, d) the exact  assessment and prediction of COVID-19 infections in a community based on the presence of enveloped  viruses in municipal wastewater, as well as e) the transfer of the developed strategy and biomarker model  to other pathogenic viruses. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that the quantification of SARSCoV-  2 as a biomarker in raw sewage enables the exact assessment and prediction of COVID-19 infections  at the population level in a given community. The developed WBE strategy will be expanded to other  pathogenic viruses. In addition, based on the developed WBE strategy we will provide guidance regarding  appropriate sampling strategies, analysis and the assessment of positive results for wastewater treatment  plant operators, health officials, and local decision makers.","3, 4",3a

P23533,First effective pharmacotherapy for ARDS to lower mortality and improve quality of life of patients.,"Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life threatening condition that affects 3 million people world-wide. With regards to the current coronavirus pandemic, ARDS is the immediate cause of death for patients suffering from this infection. 40% of the patients that suffer from the condition succumb to it and among the ones that survive, most of them face long-term physical and mental illness. The unreliable, costly, prolonged treatment options currently available are responsible for the high mortality observed in the condition. The treatments offer only relief from symptoms and manage the condition but are not curative. Exvastat is developing impentri as a reliable and effective pharmacotherapy for ARDS as it targets the cause and trigger of the mortality associated with the condition. It is an intravenous formulation of widely-used chemotherapeutic drug, Imatinib which has shown promising results in-vitro and clinical reports in ARDS like conditions. Being a repurposed drug, Impentri has the advantage of reaching human trials earlier than other drugs. With EIC funds Exvastat plans to register and successfully finish 50% of the PhaseII trials in ARDS patients. This would provide an opening for the drug to successfully finish further trials and its orphan drug status would guarantee early market entry.

P22580,West African Emerging Infectious Disease Research Center (WA-EIDRC),"Ensuring a world safe from microbial threats is a pressing challenge, as outbreaks exact tolls on human  health, disrupt regional security, and have the potential to rapidly escalate into global crises. In recent  years, severe outbreaks of Ebola, Lassa, Zika, and other emerging viruses have illustrated how vulnerable  the world is to threats from RNA viral pathogens. These public health emergencies have exposed the  urgent need for improved infrastructure, scientific knowledge, and diagnostic tools in areas of the world  most at risk, and underscore the need for proactive pathogen surveillance, detection, and discovery.  West Africa has a disproportionate vulnerability to outbreaks, but we lack awareness of acute threats,  their natural history, and effective strategies for prevention. Rooted research between local and global  partners, combined with novel assays and strategies for pandemic preparedness is required to answer  these questions. We will build the capacity to rapidly respond to future outbreaks by establishing the  West African Emerging Infectious Disease Research Center. This center will expand on years of successful  cross-disciplinary research and capacity building, bringing together leading researchers from the United  States, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We will: (1) perform comprehensive surveys of acute  RNA viral disease and determine critical threats circulating in hosts and reservoirs; (2) identify risk factors  of virus transmission and evolution; (3) dissect pathogenesis and natural history of severe RNA viral  diseases; and (4) determine diagnostic criteria for infection outcome to guide public health interventions.  Our work will significantly expand research capacity in West Africa via technology development of novel  solutions for surveillance, diagnostics, and pathogen discovery. By establishing our center with a focus on  priority pathogen research, technology transfer, training, and capacity building, we will develop flexible  strategies for detecting, mitigating, and preventing the emergence of future infectious disease outbreaks.","1, 2, 3, 4","1a, 1c, 2a, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, 4c"

C07377,Multiresolution predictive dynamics of COVID-19 risk and intervention effects,"SARS-CoV2 is a novel virus, and even as new data improves scientific insight, many uncertainties remain about key aspects of transmission. Throughout the pandemic, mathematical and statistical models of COVID-19 have had an important role in the analysis of epidemiological data, in forecasting incidence trends and in assessing the potential impact of different intervention strategies. Models developed by the Imperial College COVID-19 response team have been particularly influential, but the absence of detailed data on transmission patterns have necessitated important assumptions that limit their predictive performance. This project will (a) extend predictive models of transmission trends to include complex spatiotemporal correlation to better capture new seeding events and improve early identification of hotspots of transmission, (b) understand the causal effect of interventions on transmission and the limits to which this inference is possible, (c) systematically collate and analyse data on transmission in specific contexts (households, schools, workplaces and care homes) to derive specific transmission parameter estimates for those settings to be used to improve the ability of models to predict the impact of targeted non pharmaceutical interventions, (d) Understand how important epidemiological parameters are changing with time and what is driving these changes.

C00839,Use of wastewater analysis to evaluate the incidence of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK population,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is now viewed as a major global threat to human health. Recent estimates predict the deaths of 15 million people worldwide and that SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to result in an economic loss £2.1 trillion GDP. Effective monitoring of this pathogen is vital to estimate the amount of infection circulating in the human population, and to inform the design of measures for controlling the spread of disease. The number of hospitalization cases from SARS-CoV-2 related diseases (COVID-19) provides some measure of disease prevalence in the population, it provides no reliable information on mild infections and asymptomatic carriers. The use of random 'spot checks' and thermal imaging cameras have been introduced to screen for infections, though these are costly to implement and very imprecise. Consequently, better methods are needed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the wider population. As SARS-CoV-2 is shed in faeces in high amounts (Xiao et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020), we hypothesize that wastewater can provide a powerful indicator of disease incidence at any point in time (Ye et al., 2016), particularly as most UK urban centres are served by only 1 or 2 wastewater treatment works, thereby providing a single integrated signal of millions of people in a single sample. The aim of this NERC Urgency project is therefore to:  (1) use wastewater to provide near real-time information on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within the UK population;  (2) monitor the rise and subsequent decline of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK population, and to compare this to conventional disease reporting metrics (e.g. confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization cases);  (3) identify similarities in the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in the major urban centres of the UK;  (4) demonstrate the use of wastewater for the integrated surveillance of human pathogenic viruses within the human population;  (5) provide stakeholders (e.g. national government, NHS, HPA, PHE, PHW, HPS, water companies etc) with critical scientific information and tools to be able to respond and adapt to current and potential future disease epidemics.",3,3a

The Epistemic Insight Curriculum Framework underpins research by hundreds of practitioners in schools and Initial Teacher Education (see www.epistemicinsight.com). Designed to raise teacher confidence and expertise in science education and action research, it summarises UK curriculum expectations for scientific enquiry and literacy and provides tools to track children's progress. Accompanying resources and CPD embed these objectives and tools into hands-on science activities, cross-disciplinary investigations and real-world problem-solving. These established tools and methods will be used here to discover best practice and to test the efficacy of interventions on children's enquiry skills, scientific literacy, science capital, academic self-concept and attitudes to learning. Validated questionnaires will be used in quasi-experimental studies focusing on core variables of interest and pre-post surveys (Gopalan, et al., 2020). We describe and interpret naturally occurring variations in the baseline data and also changes over time where subjects act as their own controls. As the interventions will be tailored for multiple settings, we use linear multilevel models to model these differences as a random factor (Goldstein, 2003). Based on effect sizes established in our previous studies, we believe that our target sample sizes will be more than adequate to detect the effect sizes of interest, even if we face modest dropout.

The UK government was lucky in that, almost uniquely, a large number of military personnel were available in early 2020. It may not be so lucky next time. Other European countries, though, do not rely on luck. Virtually every one of them has a standing Civil Defence or Emergency Situations body whose sole function it is to deal with sudden national emergencies.

C15133,Highly Selective Pathogen Inactivators For Treatment of Convalescent Transfusion Plasma,"ABSTRACT   Presently, convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion is being developed as a therapy for COVID-19 patients  and as a prophylactic for high risk individuals. In addition, treatment with plasma or neutralizing antibody  preparations from convalescent patients could be the only treatment for emerging infectious diseases, for  which no other treatments may be available. At the same time, CP transfusion exposes the recipient to the risk  of transfusion transmitted diseases (TTD), a risk which is additionally exacerbated by the compromised  immune conditions of the critically ill patients. The limited number of current TTD blood tests does not provide  for full protection, restrict the critically limited donor's pool and may not be available in some areas. Pathogen  Inactivation can provide the solution. Unfortunately, the currently utilized treatments for pathogen reduction in  plasma (solvent-detergent, pasteurization of dry heat, UV or gamma irradiations) are non-selective and can  compromise the quality of plasma's neutralizing antibodies or other protective protein factors. We at ZATA  Pharmaceuticals have developed a new class of pathogen inactivators (ZPI) based on the natural polyamines  scaffold, which are truly selective in inactivating pathogens genomic molecules while sparing plasma proteins.  Our preliminary results show that ZPI have high reactivity toward nucleic acids and do not modify model  proteins (Cyt-C, RSV fusion protein) and animal sera growth factors. Using them, we inactivated different types  of pathogens (G+ and G- bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi, protozoa) and high titer preparations of enveloped or  non-enveloped viruses. Currently we are developing ZPI for pathogens reduction in transfusion red blood cells,  research funded by NIH SBIR grant (R44 HL145783). In this application we propose to adapt the new  pathogen inactivation process for treatment of convalescent plasma (CP) by: (1) using 6 virus species in  human plasma to select the optimal ZPI and conditions for pathogen inactivation in human plasma; (2) using  already developed analytical methods to establish conditions for complete neutralization and/or removal of the  residual inactivator from the treated plasma; (3) using specific antibodies against 4 virus species to  demonstrate by ELISA that the virus inactivation treatment has no effect on the binding of the antibodies to  their targets; (4) using neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein to demonstrate preservation of  the virus neutralizing properties of the antibodies after plasma treatment; (5) using repeated autologous  infusion of treated plasma to establish its in vivo the safety in the rabbit models.   After accomplishment of those initial goals we will apply for funding, including SBIR funding to complete, in  collaboration with New York Blood Center, its pre-clinical evaluation and to initiate phase I human trials, or  alternatively, will license the treatment procedure for completion of its development and marketing. Ultimately,  this proposal will lead to a safe and high quality convalescent human plasma for treatment or prophylactics of  COVID19 or other deadly diseases for which no other effective treatment is currently available.",6,6a
C19562,COVID-19 Variant Supplement - Development of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide threat. Moreover, the ability of asymptomatic carriers to transmit the disease is making it very difficult to contain and control. As such, safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 are urgently needed. The goal of this research project is to develop effective vaccines to combat COVID-19. Combining our expertise in coronaviruses, vaccine development and viral vector engineering, we plan to take novel approaches to develop highly effective vaccines against COVID-19.   We will use a helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vector to deliver antigens and we will also generate a bacterium-based BCG-COVID-19 compound vaccine. The HD-Ad vectors that we will use  offer several advantages over the conventional Ad vectors: 1) they are safer for human use and potent in the delivery of specific antigens, 2) they have a large DNA carrying capacity for expressing multiple antigen genes without the expression of non-specific antigens from the vector and 3) they produce antigens in their native folded form with proper glycosylation and may not require boosting.   BCG is an attenuated bacterium and the approved vaccine against tuberculosis in humans. In addition to its specific immune protection against TB, BCG has non-specific benefits as it prevents about 30% of infections with pathogens including viruses. We will construct a recombinant BCG that secretes a fusion protein composed of the bacterial protein antigen 85A fused to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This recombinant vaccine will not only retain BCG's nonspecific anti-viral benefits but will also produce specific immune protection against COVID-19.

C20444,Service Engagement in Early Psychosis Intervention Following the Transition to Virtual Care,"Repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be particularly detrimental for youth with serious mental illness, especially persons with psychosis. Access to services is critical for this population, as early identification and treatment in the form of specialized early psychosis intervention (EPI) can significantly improve illness trajectories. The pandemic has disrupted service delivery, urging EPI programs to rapidly adopt models of virtual care; however, little is known of the quality or effectiveness of psychosis services delivered virtually. Historically, one-third of early psychosis patients dropout from services prematurely, though the effect of a transition to virtual care on disengagement is unknown. The present study aims to investigate factors associated with disengagement from a virtual model of EPI as compared to traditional, in-person services. To meet this objective, this project will leverage data collected on an evaluation of the implementation effectiveness of e-NAVIGATE, a structured, virtually-delivered EPI program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, funded by CIHR, the Ontario Ministry of Health, and the University of Toronto. Routinely collected demographic, clinical and service use information will be extracted from electronic health records. Using prior data on in-person EPI, time to disengagement will be compared between the virtual and in-person models, examining factors that predict traditional service disengagement (namely, substance use and lack of family involvement), as well as additional health equity factors thought to impact the uptake of virtual care.

In a context of human-driven global changes, these threats will intensify with larger and more frequent epidemics, potentially leading to pandemics, will expand with geographic spreading of the mosquito vectors, and will multiply with the likely emergence of yet-unknown flaviviruses. Improving pandemic preparedness and response to these emerging and re-emerging diseases is a top priority both for the EU and WHO. However, there are no effective interventions against all flaviviruses and current vaccines targeting flaviviral proteins have severe safety issues. FLAVIVACCINE'Äôs high-impact/low-risk/disruptive ambition is to develop a novel, broad-spectrum, mosquito saliva-targeted vaccine candidate that protects against multiple different flaviviruses and is ready for clinical evaluation by building upon an experimentally-validated proof-of-concept. FLAVIVACCINE will define the immunogenicity of the pan-flavivirus target, develop and characterize a vaccine candidate against multiple flaviviruses, and prepare it for clinical evaluation. To reach these goals, FLAVIVACCINE creates a unique interdisciplinary environment of ten public and private institutions, including Universities, Research Institutions and a Vaccine Developer, from seven countries to cover all the required scientific expertise and knowledge in cell biology, virology, immunology and vaccinology.

C09575,Rolosense: An innovative platform for automatic mobile phone readout of active SARS-CoV-2 particles,"Project AbstractThe ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a novel platform technology for automatic surveillanceand tracing of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in real time. The centerpiece of this proposal is the""Rolosense"" technology which leverages a DNA micromotor as the virus sensing and transductionmaterial (VSTM) that can be detected by a conventional smart phone camera. This provides bothgeographical tracing and surveillance. Rolosense motor are comprised a DNA-coated spherical particle(5 micrometer diameter) that hybridizes to a surface modified with complementary RNA. The particlemoves at speeds of over 1 micron/minute upon the addition of RNase H, which selectively hydrolyseshybridized RNA but not single-stranded RNA. DNA motors coated with virus binding ligand (VBL) stallin presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. Because motors move autonomously for distances up tomillimeters without intervention, the assay is fully automated, and conventional steps such as viralinactivation, RNA isolation and amplification are not required. The readout is performed using anautomated smart phone app for particle tracking without the need for a spectrophotometer orfluorometer. Preliminary data shows realtime SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle sensing. Milestonesinclude the screening and identification of high affinity and high specificity VBLs. Both aptamers andantibody VBLs will be screening and validated. Simulations and experiments will be used to understandthe role of temperature and environmental conditions in modulating Rolosense performance.Multivalent display of VBLs with DNA origami will enhance avidity. Finally, microfluidic chips withairborne droplet capture will be implemented and tested.

C00917,Demystifying the antiviral activity of the IgG3+ antibody response,"Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccineis available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lackof understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immuneresponses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies hasbeen shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both ""neutralizing"" and non-neutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms inlimiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profoundimpact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the developmentof effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematicapproach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies conferprotection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spikeprotein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled usingSystems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/diseasein mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune responsefeatures that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. Coupled to a novel systems-Fc-engineeringapproach, the COVID-19 CR3022 monoclonal antibody will be engineered to specifically define the Fc-effectorfunctions that provide the greatest impact on limiting disease. Collectively, these studies will not only definecorrelates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precisemechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines.",1,1d

Prior studies in otherviral pandemics and early evidence from COVID-19 suggests that it may be effective, but formal prospectivestudies of CIP in COVID-19 are lacking. This project is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort frominfectious disease (Dr. Tania Thomas, MD, MPH), pulmonary and critical care (Dr. Jeffrey Sturek, MD, PhD),and cell therapy (Dr. Lawrence Lum, MD, DSc): a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of CIP in COVID-19 infection. The epidemiology in this largely rural catchment area projects continued enrollment through 2020-2021 fueled by subpopulations with rapid upswing in incidence, particularly in the latinx community (one of ourspecial populations for clinical research) where our health system has focused outreach and support. Thecentral hypothesis of this proposal is that early infusion of CIP with high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies inhospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease will prevent progression to critical illness and deaththrough modulation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 host immune response. This will be tested through three specificaims: Aim 1) Test the effect of high titer CIP on progression to critical illness and death in moderately illhospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease; Aim 2) Determine the effects of CIP on the hostimmune response. Blood will be collected at 0 (prior to CIP infusion), 7, 14, and 28 days after CIP infusion. Acomprehensive immunologic assessment will be performed, including high-dimensional immunophenotypingby mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, as well as functional in vitro secretion assays. These will becompared to un-treated controls. Statistical modeling will be used to test associations with clinical outcome;Aim 3) Utilize subgenomic messenger RNA analysis to map the course of virologic clearance in COVID-19disease. Subjects will be tested for viral clearance by serial nasal swab to inform duration of viral viability andimplementation of social isolation practices critical for return to settings where distancing/isolation are limited.Completion of this study will help answer a critical question about the effect of CIP on critical illness and deathin COVID-19. Importantly the in-depth follow on immunologic and virologic studies will lead to a betterunderstanding of the mechanisms of progression to critical illness with the potential for targeted immune-mediated therapeutics and a diagnostic assay for viral viability that could immediately inform clinical care.","1, 4","1d, 4b"
C09982,Policing the Pandemic: The Role of Enforcement in Securing Compliance with the  Coronavirus Regulations,"Compliance with the Coronavirus Regulations has been one of the most hotly debated topics of the pandemic. UK Police Forces were given unprecedented powers to enforce non-compliance with the Regulations, and yet there is a striking lack of robust evidence on the characteristics of those failing to comply with the Regulations. We know little about the reasons for their non-compliant behaviour, the level of risk they posed to the public or the impact of police enforcement. This project will conduct an in-depth examination of the factors and vulnerabilities underlying people's inability or unwillingness to comply and their Covid-19 testing and mortality outcomes. It will also explore police use of enforcement to secure compliance and the impact of this on individuals. Using a mixed method approach, it will provide insights from a unique database of Fixed Penalty Notices that were issued in Scotland, which will be linked at an individual level to a rich array of health, economic and social data within Scotland's Covid-19 Data for Research. It will also offer insights from interviews with individual offenders and police officers involved in the use of enforcement. The findings will be of significant interest and value to police officers, policy makers, and politicians across the UK in considering how best to encourage, enable, support or compel people to adhere to the Regulations as we encounter future waves of the current pandemic, and in any future public health (or other) emergency requiring some form of mass public compliance.",9,9a
P23037,Comprehensive characterization of ancestral populations of the vector Aedes aegypti on Indian Ocean islands,"Project Summary/Abstract  We have recently shown that the ancestors of all Aedes aegypti populations in both sub-Saharan Africa as well  as around the world presently reside on islands in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) including Madagascar.  These islands gave rise to continental African Ae. aegypti formosus no earlier than about 100,000 years ago.  We propose multidisciplinary studies on SWIO populations of Ae. aegypti along with its close relatives, Ae.  mascarensis and Ae. pia. This will include population genetics, phylogenetics/phylogeography, vector  competence, blood meal analyses, and characterization of the virome of field-caught females. We address  question such as: Are the ancestors that gave rise to Ae. aegypti s.s. capable of transmitting the same viruses  that cause human diseases? Are these mosquitoes carrying the same viruses in the field and/or do they  harbor novel undescribed arboviruses? What are the sources of their blood meals? Where do they breed?  Population genetics and phylogenetic preliminary work have already identified candidates for new undescribed  species and we suspect more cryptic taxa will be found. We propose to assemble complete genomes for the  most informative populations/taxa that will allow comparative studies as well as inference of the ancestral  genome of Ae. aegypti s.s., a fundamental resource for analysis of a plethora of genomics studies ongoing in  laboratories around the world.",2,2b
C03808,HVTN 405/HPTN 1901 Characterizing SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in convalescent individuals,"This proposal outlines the scientific agenda for the Leadership and Operations Center of the HIV VaccineTrials Network (HVTN), the collaboration of physician scientists at 64 clinical trial sites in 15 countries on 4continents dedicated to developing globally effective vaccines for HIV, tuberculosis and now SARS-CoV-2.The HVTN has led HIV prevention science for over 20 years through robust phase 1 and 2 clinicaldevelopment trials and currently has 2 vector based vaccines (ALVAC and Ad26) and 1 broadly neutralizingmonoclonal antibody (mAb) VRC01 undergoing testing in 5 randomized controlled efficacy trials.With the rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize there is a significant gap in knowledge in thefield on the contribution of immune functions involved in preventing infection, in modifying COVID-19 disease,and in clearing viral infection. We believe the HVTN is well placed to study these gaps and rapidly deploy thisinformation in the development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing vaccines and mAb therapies. In this study wepropose initiating an observational cohort study of approximately 400 persons in the United States (22 trialssites) and Peru (5 sites) convalescing from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants will be recruited from a varietyof risk groups and clinical cohorts: hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, adultsbetween 18 and 55 years of age and those older than 55 years, and persons with high interest clinical orvirologic presentations (eg, persons who developed myocarditis/pericarditis, required intubation, had prolongedviral shedding, or who develop a positive virologic test after initially clearing the infection). Specific aims ofthis study include identifying serologic reactivities that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from vaccination, todevelop and qualify a suite of immunologic assays and reference reagents that will permit detailedinterrogations of the immune response to infection, to measure SARS-CoV-2 adaptive response in keypopulations and risk groups, and to characterize presentations of the infection among convalescent individuals.This initial study will tell us much about the adaptive immune responses in persons who have been infectedand recovered from SARS-CoV-2 and will shed light on the role the immune system plays in successfullyclearance of infection. It will improve our understanding of the dynamics and duration of responses, as well asthe epitope specificity and other defining signatures, and will inform rational design and testing of preventiveand therapeutic vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. In addition, this protocol will lay the groundwork forprospective studies of this infection, better defining key risk groups and knowledge gaps. Lastly, this study willprepare the network for the large number of COVID-19 vaccines now entering the clinical trial pipeline.Laboratory, statistical and operational experience in this first trial will be invaluable preparation and priming ofnetwork machinery as the HVTN prepare to roll-out several efficacy trials as part of the joint NIAID COVIDPrevention Network in coming months.","1, 3, 4","1a, 1d, 3d, 4a, 4b"

P25500,"PARROT: Penicillin Allergy, Antibiotic Resistance and Patient health OuTcomes","JARGON BUSTER: Antibiotic: A medicine used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics work by killing bacteria. Antibiotic resistant bacteria: 'Superbugs like MRSA'. Bacteria that have changed so they are no longer killed by antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance/AMR: A term used to describe the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Bloodstream Infection/BSI: A serious infection caused by bacteria in the blood. PARROT: Fellowship study's short name. Penicillins: A common group of antibiotics. Penicillin allergy/PenA: When your immune system reacts abnormally to penicillin, wrongly thinking it is harmful.   BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistant bacteria have a huge impact on patients and the NHS because infections involving these resistant bacteria mean our usual antibiotic treatments will not work as well. People who are affected take longer to get better from common infections and are more likely to die from serious infections e.g.bloodstream infections (BSI). This problem is often called AMR. AMR is caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Penicillins are the first-choice treatment for many common infections. People who have Penicillin allergy/PenA are treated with different, non-penicillin antibiotics. People with PenA are typically prescribed more antibiotics overall, partly because the alternative antibiotics fail to clear the infection. Research has shown that although many people have PenA labels in their notes, most of these people (9 in 10) do not actually have a true allergy when they are tested by a specialist, which means antibiotics are being misused and overused.  HEALTH NEED: PenA labels have been linked with 'superbugs', however the full impact of PenA on AMR is unknown. In particular the impact of PenA on AMR and health outcomes in patients treated for BSI and COVID-19 (both of which can cause life-threatening sepsis) is not known. We know that antibiotic use can affect the bacteria that normally live in our guts and mouths. These help us digest food and prevent infections. The more antibiotics are used, the more likely it is that these helpful bacteria are 'killed off', leading to harmful bacteria growing in their place. These harmful bacteria may be able to cause infections, or have genes that make them resistant to antibiotics, or both. See https://youtu.be/r_50QNX0-t0  AIM: To understand the links between PenA, AMR and patient health outcomes in order to improve antibiotic use.  METHODS: PARROT is organised into three workstreams:  Firstly, I will use a large collection of patient data provided by the PIONEER Health Data Research hub, who hold anonymised data on patients admitted hospital. This data will be used to see if PenA patients who have BSI are more likely to have AMR.  Secondly, using data from the NIHR funded PEACH study which is investigating antibiotic use in patients with COVID-19, I will carry out a study to find out the effect of PenA on AMR and patient health outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19.  Thirdly, I will work with the ALABAMA trial, a NIHR-funded trial which aims to remove incorrect PenA labels through pencilling allergy testing. I will recruit ALABAMA trial participants, to carry out a study within a trial that will explore if removing incorrect PenA labels results in reduced AMR.   PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT (PPI):  Jenny Boards (PPI lead contributor) has brought her 'PenA lived experience' to co-design PARROT, guiding simplification of the scientific language, and ensuring a patient benefit focus.  DISSEMINATION:  This research will benefit patients, healthcare workers and policymakers by providing the evidence to support better antibiotic prescribing and help limit AMR. It will tell us if removing incorrect PenA labels results in less AMR. Results will be shared through presentations at scientific meetings, publications in journals and a short video co-developed with PPI-contributors.",4,4c
C15191,COVID Protection After Transplant (CPAT) Multicenter Adaptive Trial,"Solid organ transplant recipients experience high mortality from COVID-19 due to a combination of  immunosuppression and comorbidities. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been highly effective in the  general population, recent studies show that solid organ transplant recipients are less likely to develop  protective antibody responses. In addition, long term studies of safety, including immunologic sequela such as  rejection, and de novo donor-specific antibody formation are lacking.  We propose a Multicenter Randomized Adaptive Design Trial to investigate strategies for CPAT (COVID  Protection After Transplant). This trial will build on results from a CPAT Pilot Trial in 200 kidney transplant  reipients which will investigate the safety and immunogenicity of 3rd dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in  recipients who fail to develop high level antibodies after a standard 2 dose series. That trial will identify key  correlates of risk and efficacy. This trial will incorporate that data to investigate additional protective strategies  including the use of different vaccine platforms and changes in immunosuppression in 800 solid organ  transplant recipients with suboptimal anti-spike antibody responses across 15 US transplant centers. This trial  will personalize randomization to candidate arms with the highest probability of success using a Bayesian  framework. In conjuction, we will perform novel, comprehensive virologic and immunologic mechanistic studies  to better understand vaccine-associated immunity over time.  Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in Transplant Surgery, Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology,  Biostatistics, Pathology, Virology, and Immunology. Our team has experience successfully enrolling and  conducting multicenter transplantation trials (U01AI134591, U01AI138897) and will leverage existing  infrastructure for operations, data management, analysis, and safety reporting.  In summary, this Multicenter Adaptive Design CPAT Trial will determine the immunogenicity and safety of  novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies in 800 transplant recipients across the United States. Important  mechanistic studies will further fundamental understanding of development of protective immune responses in  this vulnerable population.","1, 4, 7","1d, 4a, 7e, 7l"

C07112,A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to more than 470,000 deaths. This disease is especially perilousfor the elderly - 80% of deaths in the US have been individuals over the age of 65, and the social isolation created by lockdowns have increased risks of serious physical and mental health issues. COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild (e.g.loss of smell, dry cough) to critical (e.g. cytokine storm, renal failure, cardiovascular damage, respiratory failure, lethal blood clotting, neurological disorders). This clinical heterogeneity demands a precision medicine approach that elucidates distinct pathways underlying the disease, develops treatments for each pathway, and defines biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification within the subsets. A key benefit of precision medicine is that drugs may be repurposed or may already exist to treat specific subsets of infected individuals. For example, one critical outcome for COVID-19 infection is the onset of a cytokine storm, in which the body's immune system gets caught in a positive feedback loop, leading to shock and rapid failure of multiple organs.There are existing drugs for treating cytokine storm syndrome, but practitioners have no clear guidelines if such treatments are beneficial or destructive. If the individual is not in a hyperinflammatory state, the administration of these drugs could cripple their immune response, leading to increased viral load. Plasma biomarker patterns of proteins and metabolites hold potential to identify impending cytokine storms and other lethal outcomes.     To advance precision medicine for COVID-19 treatment, this work will generate large-scale omics data and evaluate levels of proteins and metabolites for plasma drawn from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 normal controls. These data will be immediately released to the research community. Our research team will take a concerted multipronged approach for analyzing these data using diverse complementary techniques. Our labs' research focuses on the discovery of combinations of genes and proteins expressing synchronously and the associations of these combinations with traits of interest, as well as endophenotype discovery. In addition to thorough single analyte analyses, this research will employ three computational strategies to reveal combinations of factors defining patterns: 1) network modeling, 2) explainable-AI systems biology, and 3) linear programming.    These intensive analyses will require significant computational resources and we will utilize Summit at Oak RidgeNational Laboratory, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, for these tasks. The comprehensive protein and metabolite profiles, based on a large cohort of COVID-19 cases and normal controls, along with our rigorous interrogation of these data for complex biomarker patterns indicative of patient outcomes, hold unprecedented potential to drive solid advances in precision medicine and to reduce mortality rates due to COVID-19. In addition, this research will provide an agile model for use when tackling other heterogeneous diseases plaguing humankind, as well as novel viruses that may arise in the future.",4,"4a, 4b, 4c"
P22156,Lipid nanoparticles as novel adjuvants inducing effective T follicular helper cell and humoral immune responses,"ABSTRACT  Vaccines prevent hundreds of millions of illnesses and save millions of lives every year. Various types of  licensed vaccines (live attenuated and inactivated pathogens, adjuvanted protein subunits) provide some level  of protection against a variety of dangerous illnesses. However, there are multiple pathogens for which no  effective vaccines are available. Protective immunity against many pathogens can be achieved through long-  lived and high-affinity antibody responses, which are driven by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells are  required for the formation and maintenance of germinal centers (GC), where B cell affinity maturation, class  switch, and development of long-lived plasma and memory B cells occur. Thus, the magnitude or quality of  antibody responses induced by a vaccine is shaped by its ability to induce Tfh cells. The identification of  vaccine platforms or adjuvants that induce potent Tfh cell responses and broadly protective and durable  antibody responses is a critical need in vaccinology. We have identified a potent vaccine adjuvant, lipid  nanoparticles (LNPs), which induce strong Tfh cell differentiation and durable antibody responses after a single  immunization when combined with protein subunits, inactivated virus or antigen-encoding mRNA. Importantly,  our preliminary studies demonstrated the superiority of LNP's adjuvant activity over the FDA-approved vaccine  adjuvant, MF59, in comparative studies. This proposal will aim to extend our preliminary findings, examine  LNP's adjuvanticity in non-human primate immunization studies and investigate the mechanisms of action of  LNPs. In 3 specific aims we will: 1.) Determine LNP's adjuvanticity in multiple vaccine platforms in mice. 2.)  Assess the potency of LNP-adjuvanted Zika vaccines in non-human primates. 3.) Uncover LNP-induced  immune mechanisms that regulate the biology of Tfh cells.  This proposal aims to demonstrate that LNPs can be used as adjuvants in various conventional (inactivated  pathogen and protein subunits) and unconventional (mRNA, DNA) vaccine types to induce strong Tfh cell and  durable neutralizing antibody responses. This finding could have a significant impact on vaccine development  as no licensed vaccines or adjuvants have been shown to potently activate Tfh cells that are critical for durable  protective antibody responses against many pathogens. We believe that the data generated in this proposal  will be capable of moving this vaccine adjuvant towards clinical trials.",7,7a
C15199,Longitudinal study of health outcomes and mitigating factors in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic,"ABSTRACT  The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already claimed over 2 million lives and caused economic  and social disruption on an unprecedented scale. There is growing concern about long-term consequences of  the pandemic on physical and mental health outcomes of children, stemming from both the illness and from  associated disruptions in the economic, social, and healthcare domains. Our overall goal is to study  trajectories of child/adolescent mental health and primary healthcare utilization including immunization,  in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our project, located in India, will test key hypotheses about the  pandemic's impact on health outcomes, vulnerability to future shocks, and sources of heterogeneity in these  relationships. A strategic innovation is to create a new health panel dataset - called the SurvEy of HeAlth  Trends (SEHAT), which means ""health"" in Hindi - by leveraging the world's largest household panel data on  consumption and economic outcomes in India. The SEHAT data will be a new health module spanning 9 waves  from September 2021 - August 2024 to generate timely evidence on the pandemic's impact on trajectories of  health outcomes. Our project on three COVID-related stressors: (1) disruptions in economic circumstances,  (2) disruptions in the social environment, or (3) exposure to severe COVID illness within family networks. We  estimate the association between these stressors and (a) mental health, and (b) rates of immunization and  primary healthcare utilization. Our second aim is to examine impact of COVID-related stressors on  vulnerability to future shocks. Using 9 waves of panel data over a three-year period, we will examine new  economic shocks, such as job or income losses in the household, and their cumulative effects on child health  outcomes. Our main hypothesis is that the negative impact of future shocks on child health outcomes will be  greater in magnitude among children in households that experienced higher levels of COVID-related stressors  compared with children from households with lower levels of these stressors. We will also leverage the large  amount of data to examine sources of heterogeneity in COVID impacts on child health outcomes, by factors such  as gender, caste, or household composition. Our third aim is to make SEHAT panel dataset publicly available  to facilitate research and inform policy. Our study aims to collect health data that can be transformative for  research and evidence-based policy. We plan to release descriptive statistics on key indicators immediately after  every wave, with accompanying policy briefs. After completion of SEHAT data collection in August 2024, we will  publicly release microdata by August 2026, prior to end of the grant period. We will also publish detailed  documentation to facilitate analysis using the SEHAT data.","9, 10, 11","9e, 10a, 10b, 11a"
P22076,Development of MS2045 for inhibition of Zika methyltransferase,"Project Summary  The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus that includes other arthropod-borne human pathogens  such as dengue virus and West Nile virus, among others. ZIKVÃ¢Â€Â™s link to microcephaly in newborn infants and the  Guillan-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome in adults has invigorated measures to develop a vaccine, as well as efforts to develop  antivirals based on targeting enzymatic activities central to the life cycle and survival of ZIKV. One such  enzymatic activity is encoded by the methyltransferase (MTase) domain, located at the N-terminus of the  nonstructural protein NS5. Taking a structure informed approach, we have succeeded in identifying a novel  Ã¢Â€Âœlead-likeÃ¢Â€Â compound (MS2045) for the inhibition of ZIKVÃ¢Â€Â™s NS5 MTase activity and for blocking its replication.  MS2045 provides a basis for further chemistry and the development of even more potent inhibitors. In aim 1,  we will a) design MS2045 analogs with the capacity to establish specific interactions with unique amino acids of  ZIKV MTase as a means to provide additional selectivity against the human RNA 5Ã¢Â€Â™-cap MTases; b) chemically  synthesize these analogs and produce them to a purity of 95% for in vitro and cell-based assays, and for  structural studies. In aim 2, we will a) perform biophysical assays to assess the ability of these analogs to  selectively bind the ZIKV NS5-MTase as compared to the human RNA 5Ã¢Â€Â™-cap MTases and test their ability to  inhibit RNA methylation; b) test these analogs in viral cell-based assays to assess their efficacy in blocking viral  replication; c) determine structures ZIKV NS5-Mtase with select analogs for additional, iterative rounds of  structure activity relationships (SARs). Collectively, these studies will help to identify analogs of MS2045 that  can be potentially developed into potent and selective inhibitors of NS5-MTase from ZIKV (and other pathogenic  flaviviruses)",6,6a
C03027,Integrated multi-omic delineation of SARS-CoV-2-dysregulated cellular processes,"As of May 10 2020, there were a reported >4 million confirmed cases and > 285,000 deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus (CoV) SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 disease. Our understanding of the molecular factors that are responsible for the virulence and the selection of host cells to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 that could explain the emerging variety of clinical symptoms reported in COVID-19 patients is rudimentary at best. All strategies of rapidly developing tools to mitigate this catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are fundamentally dependent on us identifying and controlling those proteins that execute the cellular mechanisms critical for SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect and replicate in host cells. We will use a powerful novel tool, called SOMAscan, to rapidly determine how COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), and a variety of other coronaviruses, affect large numbers of proteins in different human lung cells, the normal target of the COVID-19 virus. By examining how non-pathogenic, and highly pathogenic, coronaviruses, such as SARS-1, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 specifically and differentially affect cellular proteins, we will learn the unique ways in which the deadly coronaviruses can cause disease. We also will examine how these cellular proteins, and virus infection, are influenced by treatment with a variety of anti-viral agents, some of which are currently in clinical trials, to improve the information gained in these complementary clinical trials. Finally, we also will determine how affecting some of the proteins we identify can impact coronavirus-mediated growth and disease processes. Results obtained in this research will provide vital fundamental information about the molecular replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and will form the foundation for more in-depth studies, all of which will pave the way for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve human health.","1, 4, 6","1b, 4b, 6a"

C15331,MHC Variation in Host Response to SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19 Outcomes,"SUMMARY  Located within the human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) chromosome 6p21, the Human Leukocyte  Antigen (HLA) region is the most medically important region of the human genome. Variation in the HLA region  has been associated with over 150 diseases and conditions, including infectious disease, cancers, and major  drug-hypersensitivities. While little is known at this point about the impact of host genetic factors in COVID-19,  the epidemiology to-date reveals wide variation in disease course among confirmed cases of infection that does  not appear to be fully explained by known risk factors. Because of its pivotal role in the immune response  understanding the role of HLA variation promises to provide important insights relevant to understanding the  immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, while informing vaccine development and potential immunotherapies. In  Specific Aim 1, we will exploit an existing data resource, partnering with the National Marrow Donor Program  and DKMS registries to collect data on COVID-19 symptoms, testing and outcomes using a novel, validated  smartphone app in a very large sample (N=300,000-500,000) of volunteer bone marrow donors with pre-existing  HLA genotyping data, allowing an extraordinarily well-powered examination of the role of these genes in disease.  In Specific Aim 2, we will employ a novel, validated method for next-generation sequencing of the extended MHC  (~5Mb), including all classical and non-classical HLA loci, as well as over 150 additional immune system loci, in  large and diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patients (N=2000), as well patient cohorts with longitudinal clinical data  and extensive immunoprofiling (N=300). Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will contextualize these association studies  through examination of the role of HLA presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. In summary, we will leverage  large and diverse patient cohorts alongside cutting edge technology and molecular biology to reveal the role of  these important immune loci in COVID-19.",1,"1b, 1d"

C19578,COVID-19 Variant Supplement - Inferring undiagnosed sources of COVID-19 infections using viral genomes,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is believed to be significantly influenced by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients. Understanding the role that asymptomatic patients play in the spread of the disease is vital for informing testing procedures. This project aims to build a tool to identify asymptomatic or undiagnosed patients by examining infected people around them without the need to directly test them, allowing health authorities to make rapid and better informed decisions.  Viral genomes accumulate small changes, mutations, which usually are neutral in terms of disease progression. These can be used to trace transmission networks - individuals within the network will have acquired the disease from a single source and so will share the same variants. Current approaches do not detect utilize all variants especially the low-frequency ones and so rate less robust in building accurate transmission networks, and inferring transmission by asymptomatic carriers. By utilizing our previously developed tools and expertise in inferring HIV transmission networks, we will develop new mathematical models that are able to infer SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  The sequencing data needed to map viral transmission will be acquired through a project funded by the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute (ACHRI) and Genome Alberta, which aims to sequence 1,900 COVID-19 patients. In collaboration with our partner organization, Public Health Laboratory under Alberta Health Services (ProvLab) who performs COVID-19 diagnostics for the province of Alberta, we will obtain information on asymptomatic patients who have tested positive for the virus, remove them from our data, and then see if we can retrospectively identify them as likely contacts between the symptomatic individuals.. The resulting tools can be extended for use across Canada, and potentially even model future outbreaks of infections diseases in humans, livestock, and wildlife.",3,3a

This application extends the work  of ASU's health disparities U54 center grant (RFA-MD-17-005; 5U54MD002316) and its RADx-UP supplement  (3U54MD002316-14S1) by reducing disparities in COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccination, education, wraparound  services and health care, with the goal of improving the health of vulnerable and underserved communities.  The aims of this emergency competitive revision closely match and enhance the aims of the current U54 award  and its RADx-UP supplement. The focus on populations along the AZ-Mexico border will add to existing  knowledge about assets and vulnerabilities of diverse transnational communities disproportionally affected by  the pandemic. The approach empowers local communities, is data driven, and creates the infrastructure  capacity for community-driven delivery of care. Following a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR)  orientation, the revised supplement expands our existing R.A.P.I.D. program by improving access and  decreasing hesitancy to COVID-19 testing and vaccination among underserved and vulnerable populations in  the border region. Equality Health Foundation (EHF) will continue to serve as the lead community partner for  the proposed revised supplement and the ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Laboratory (ABCTL) will provide and  analyze the saliva-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Local partners  coordinated by EHF under the One Community Initiative against COVID-19 will implement the vaccination  program. Over two years, the revised supplement aims to reach 7,000 additional community members living  and working along the AZ-Mexico border. CDCC surveys from border communities will be added to the  ongoing longitudinal study we are conducting to assess the intervention's impact and also by comparing  randomly selected participants (N=200) with a matched comparison group (N=200) randomly selected from  regular testing sites. We will also conduct ongoing COVID-19 variants sequence validation among those tested  and inform appropriate health authorities if significant variants emerge. The transdisciplinary team has the  infrastructure, capacity, and community partnerships in place to implement the project effectively and  efficiently. ASU's existing NIMHD-funded U54 center, guided by its Community and Scientific Advisory Board  and in collaboration with government agencies, tribal governments, community organizations, and academic  units within ASU, is well equipped to undertake the proposed revised supplement.","1, 9","1c, 9b, 9d"

C01030,Epidémiolgie - Santé Publique (Epidemiology - Public Health) - NOSOCOVID: Prévention de la transmission du COV-19 dans les établissements de santé égyptiens    NOSOCOVID : Preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Egyptian healthcare settings,"Egypt had the first reported confirmed case of COVID-19 on the African continent on Feb 14, 2020. Local transmission has been confirmed since, and as of Apr 10, 2020, Egypt ranked among the countries the most affected in Africa with 1,699 confirmed cases. The Egyptian health authorities' response was one of the first to be implemented on the continent. Currently, the healthcare response relies on several quarantine hospitals devoted for COVID-19 patients only. This strategy could be completed with a broader mobilization of general hospitals in case of COVID-19 patients overload.  In this context, healthcare institutions are facing major challenges. First, the community spread is leading to a large demand in available beds and to a saturation in hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 patients, particularly in intensive care units. Second, the outbreak, its managements, and the fact that healthcare workers are particularly exposed to the virus are causing a large-scale disorganization of the entire healthcare system. Third, healthcare settings have been shown to be hotspots of transmission of coronaviruses, notably due to the high density of contacts.  Mathematical modelling has become a standard to analyse the spread of infectious diseases. It has provided a theoretical framework for understanding complex transmission dynamics within healthcare settings and a quantitative approach to estimating the impact of various infection control strategies and their combined effects. This approach has already been widely developed to understand, anticipate and assess possibilities for controlling the current COVID-19 epidemic in the community. However, no model has yet been specifically proposed to assess control measures in healthcare settings. Moreover, models for nosocomial transmission in healthcare settings for various pathogens have gathered important interest in high-income countries. However, there has been a scarcity of research efforts to model pathogen spread in healthcare settings in low- and middle-income countries.  The objective of this project is to address the risk associated with SARS-Cov-2 nosocomial transmission and support its control in an Egyptian healthcare setting. More specifically, the project will rely on the adaptation of an existing mathematical model to simulate different healthcare organization and control strategies. The model will be calibrated in order to reproduce the SARS-Cov-2 circulation in an Egyptian quarantine hospital (15th of May Hospital, Cairo). Then, we will evaluate various control strategies, including those considered by local health authorities, in terms of risk of COVID-19 acquisition by healthcare workers. In a second step, the model will reproduce the virus circulation in a general hospital with a dedicated section for COVID-19 management, and strategies will be evaluated in terms of risk of COVID-19 acquisition by patients and healthcare workers.  Results of this project will provide insight for the control of nosocomial dissemination of SARS-Cov-2 in Egypt. Results may also be informative at a broader scale, on the African and above.

C21064,Provision of Technical Assistance for Covid-19 Vaccine Delivery Preparation and Readiness,"The introduction of a new vaccine provides many opportunities as well as challenges to improve a country's overall immunization programme as well as its health services and health system. Many of the activities carried out to prepare, implement and monitor the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination will provide opportunities to improve the immunization programme and to identify best practices that could be applied to other health programmes and services. Activities that should be integrated into the national primary health care (PHC) operational framework include: microplanning, using an evidence-based decision-making process to govern the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine; strengthening human resource management; training for new vaccine introduction; establishing new contact points for vaccination across the life course; ensuring traceability systems and technologies are leveraged to ensure the integrity and efficiency of supply chains, improving and expanding integrated project management and the supply chain; enhancing integrated disease surveillance and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) monitoring and reporting systems; and conducting integrated advocacy and communications activities to promote demand for vaccination as part of increasing overall demand and acceptability of all essential PHC services. Moreover, the most vulnerable include older populations, therefore building capacity for adult immunizations, including synergy of COVID-19 vaccine with influenza vaccination, will be important.  Gavi and Swiss TPH came into a framework agreement for an initial period of 13 months until 31st December 2021, with the possibility to extend for an additional 12 months until 31st December 2022 to bring support to the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) of 11 countries.

The proposed supplemental project will engage the large network of FIU-RCMIcommunity partner organizations forged by our Engagement Core.     Our primary focus will be on Miami-Dad eorganizations serving URM communities suffering disparities in rates of COVID-19 fatalities, infection,exposure, testing, and access to care. Our primary emphasis will be the developing, designing, and mounting of community-partnered efforts (i.e., Town Hall Meetings) to promote COVID-19 vaccine literacy among URM groups, with direct attention to readiness for participation in (a) candidate vaccine trials and (b) approved vaccine rapid deployment.      The aims of this proposed supplement are to inform and educate Miami-Dade URMcommunities through Town Halls facilitated by community organizations that serve these hard-to reach communities. Our efforts will be community partnered and involve a formative phase for developing and testing materials, and an implementation phase for conducting Town Halls. The implementation phase also will include assessing the Town Halls' impact on readiness for participation in (a) candidate vaccine trials and (b) approved vaccine rapid deployment. We anticipate reaching a minimum of 700 community stakeholders andinfluencers through the Town Halls. Town Hall participant data will be collected through real-time polling at theopening (pre) and close (post) of each Town Hall meeting. We hypothesize Town Hall participants will demonstrate pre-to-post increases in: knowledge of the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccine trials and vaccines; knowledge of the scientific process and vaccine safety and efficacy; confidence about participating in vaccine trials; trust in receiving the approved vaccines; and readiness to participate in vaccine trials and approved vaccines. Separately, Town Hall participants will be asked if they would like to participate in a vaccine trial; any Town Hall participant indicating interest will be asked to provide contact information, and will receive a follow-up contact from the FIU-RCMI with information and instructions on vaccine trial participation.1",9,"9a, 9b, 9c, 9d"

P23400,Post-COVID-19 recovery: Overcoming economic hardship and violence against women in southern Benin,"The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to contain it have threatened livelihoods, introduced new occupational risks and increased the precariousness of labour relations, especially for women. At the beginning of the pandemic, in addition to the recommended preventative measures, Benin established a ""sanitary cordon"" that separated the south from the hinterlands to reduce the spread spread of the virus. These measures also slowed economic activities and disrupted social relations at all levels. Women have been particularly affected and were victims of an upsurge in gender-based violence.    The overall objective of the project is to study the differentiated effects of COVID-19 and the sanitary cordon by gender and among women's socio-economic groups, shedding light on the increased risks of multifaceted violence they have faced. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, the project will use primary and secondary data sources and various collection techniques such as surveys and individual and group interviews. Expected results include contributing to policy formulation and guiding government interventions for gender equality and gender-based violence. In addition, the project will strengthen the capacities of the next generation of women in research and intervention through the awarding of scholarships to women for training in Benin and Canada.'ÄØ    This project is funded by the Women RISE initiative (Women'Äôs health and economic empowerment for a COVID-19 Recovery that is Inclusive, Sustainable, and Equitable), funded by IDRC, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

C03826,Evaluation of the Interplay between HIV and COVID-19 in a large urban safety-net HIV clinic,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT An unprecedented public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding worldwide and the United States has been the epicenter of the pandemic since March 26, 2020. No prior global pandemic ofthis scale has overlapped temporally with the HIV pandemic. Despite this, given the breathtaking speed atwhich the pandemic has progressed, very little is known about the interplay between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 given that COVID-19 has only recently entered areas of high HIV prevalence. The COVID-19 pandemic isthreatening worldwide gains in UNAIDS 90:90:90 targets for HIV by disrupting health systems, economies, andthe health of people with HIV. San Francisco was the first city in the U.S. to impose ""shelter in place""public health measures on March 16, 2020. Given the need to limit in-person visits to counter the spread ofCOVID-19, research on the impact on HIV outcomes, retention in care, and socio behavioral outcomes will becrucial to develop interventions to attenuate COVID-19's deleterious impact and to plan for future pandemics. Whether people with HIV (PWH) are more or less susceptible to COVID-19 or severe disease is unknown;some of the risk factors for severe COVID-19 (older age, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease) are more prevalent among PWH but HIV medications such as tenofovir and its metabolites could be protective. PWH inlow-income settings have marginal housing and food insecurity, increasing transmission risk. Given the impactof HIV on immune responses, it is also important to understand if PWH will have less durable immunity against COVID-19 following infection. Finally, the impact of the COVID-19's disruption of medical and social services for PWH needs urgent study, both during the crisis and in its aftermath, since COVID-19 has the potential toeradicate the progress made on Ending the HIV Epidemic to date.     This proposal will answer three vital questions concerning the interplay between the two viruses. The site of the study will be at the Ward 86 HIV Clinic, a large safety-net clinic for publicly-insured patients with HIV in San Francisco, near the neighborhoods experiencing concentrated COVID-19 epidemics.     Aim 1 will provide novel, urgently needed insights into how SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, prevalence and clinical outcomes vary by HIV status and/or antiretroviral regimen (i.e. tenofovir).   Aim 2 will explore whether HIV infection will impair humoral or T-cell responses to COVID-19, providing insights for therapeutic and vaccine development.   Aim 3 data will evaluate the impact of disruption of healthcare and social support systems on PWH, including viral suppression; retention in care; hospitalizations, co-morbidity outcomes, and non-COVID-19 related death; healthcare utilization during COVID019; and socio-behavioral outcomes during and after social distancing toassess isolation, food insecurity, stress, substance use, stigma, and resilience.     Harnessing, the researchinfrastructure of the UCFAR, city wide COVID-19 registries, and a large, aging population of PWH served by the Ward 86 clinic, this grant will put immediate, high-impact studies in place to track the colliding pandemics.","1, 4, 9, 10","1b, 4a, 4b, 4c,"
P21883,University of Washington Arboviral Research Network (UWARN),"Abstract: The United World Antiviral Research Network (UWARN, formerly referred to as the University of Washington Arboviral Research Network) will address emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases by carrying out research on arboviruses that include current high burden pathogens including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Arboviruses also include emerging and re-emerging viruses such as Mayaro, Una, Usutu, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Oropouche viruses. UWARN will leverage the UW Alliance (formerly Metacenter) for Pandemic Disease Preparedness and strong research laboratory partners in Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, Pakistan and Taiwan as well as the UW Department of Global Health global reach in capacity building. The UWARN international Collaborating Partners have institution-based and population-based cohorts in place to carry out the planned research and monitor for new virus emergence. The proposed UWARN research will create new human viral-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Hu-nMabs) that can be used as therapeutics or diagnostics. UWARN research will also create new diagnostics, created ab initio by the Institute for Protein Design, as artificial proteins that release light when antibodies to virus are present in body fluids. Finally, UWARN research will generate an understanding of how viruses manipulate the human innate immune system, and this information will be used to design biomarkers to predict severe disease as well as to suggest host-directed therapies that could lead to better outcomes after arboviral infection. The proposed technologies are generic and could be rapidly adapted to any future emerging arbovirus threat. UWARN collaborators span virology, bacteriology, mycology, and parasitic infections, such that UWARN can respond to diverse emerging infectious diseases threats. UWARN international laboratories have advanced capabilities including biorepositories with generator-power backed-up -80C freezers, next-generation sequencing (NGS) capabilities, fluorescence cell sorting, and BSL-3 containment facilities. UWARN cohorts have biobanked samples taken from individuals during acute febrile illnesses, with known and unknown arboviral diseases, and partnership sites are poised for prospective collection of population and facilityÃ¢Â€Â""based samples. UWARN labs will use metagenomic NGS to detect novel viral emergence in affiliated cohorts. UWARN Partners have collaborating entomologists and veterinarians to sample arthropod vectors and animal reservoirs as needed. Additional innovative capacity included the Brazil UWARN partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s mobile van with on board NGS capability for real-time, on-site viral sequencing and sampling to viral identification in less than 18 hrs. A second partner, IRESSEF in Senegal, plans to set up a similar mobile vehicle for viral sampling and sequencing in Senegal and the Brazil group will collaborate with IRESSEF on technology transfer and best practices.

P26515,Unmet needs of immigrant older adults after discharge from hospital with delirium: Using administrative data to explore practice patterns and long-term adverse health outcomes,"Older Canadians represent over 40% of hospital admissions and are at increased risk of experiencing hospital related harms. One of these harms is delirium, a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by an acute onset of confusion. Delirium affects up to 50% of hospitalized older patients and is associated with serious consequences including dementia, admission to long-term care and death. Immigrant older adults may be at greater risk of poor outcomes after discharge as a result of insufficient health services and supports. The experience of low income, systemic racism, and language barriers may lead to inequitable care including increased prescription of harmful medications, and less access to home care or follow up. The hospital visitor restrictions employed during the COVID-19 pandemic may have further widened these gaps as immigrant older adults often have a greater reliance on family members for support. There is currently a lack of research exploring the post-discharge period after delirium and the differences in care and outcomes for immigrant populations. My thesis proposal will use large health databases to compare the practice patterns and long-term adverse outcomes after discharge from hospital with delirium between immigrant and non-immigrant older adults. We will investigate long-term adverse outcomes including a new diagnosis of dementia. We will explore changes in antipsychotic prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare differences by immigrant status. We will examine the predictors of long-term care home admission including social risk factors such as sex, income, and immigrant status. We anticipate that immigrant older adults will receive more antipsychotics, less support after discharge and have more long-term harmful outcomes. Understanding the unmet needs of immigrant older adults after delirium will assist clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to implement interventions to better support patients and families.",10,10a
C06756,Novel Role for the P2Y2 Receptor in the Autoimmune Disease Sjogren's Syndrome,"Salivary gland dysfunction is symptomatic of Sjögren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease associated with lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary gland. A commonality between many human autoimmune diseases, including SS, is chronic inflammation whereby sustained accumulation of immune cells promotes tissue degeneration and often leads to other damaging effects. A major focus of the parent grant for this supplement is to identify the functional relevance of extracellular nucleotide ""alarmones"" that are produced at the site of initial tissue damage. We have shown that G protein-coupled P2Y2 receptors (P2Y2R) for ATP and UTP are early responders to released nucleotide alarmones and that knockout of the P2Y2R in a mouse model of SS prevents infiltration of B and T lymphocytes into salivary glands, indicating a loss of the systemic immune response. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation in SS salivary glands is mediated by P2Y2Rs through activation of several signaling pathways through its distinct structural motifs. The Specific Aims of the parent grant are to investigate the cell mechanisms that initiate chronic inflammation at the level of P2Y2 receptors and to test the potential of targeting the P2Y2R in SS to prevent a systemic immune response. Directly relevant to this supplemental proposal, we have identified an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in the 1st extracellular loop of the P2Y2R and conclusively demonstrated its direct interaction with and activation of RGD-binding integrins. Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attach to cells via a receptor-binding domain (RBD) located on its Spike (S) protein. Interestingly, the S protein RBD also contains an RGD motif, suggesting that RGD-binding integrins may be co-receptors with ACE2 for S protein. Thus, considering the presence of an RGD motif in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD and the established interaction between ACE2 and integrins, we hypothesize that P2Y2Rs and RGD-binding integrins modulate SARS-CoV-2 entry. In addition to lung tissues, ACE2 is also expressed in oral epithelial cells, particularly in the tongue. This finding suggests that the oral cavity is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which presents a significant concern for potential infections associated with dental procedures. Thus, this supplement offers a unique opportunity to test the novel hypotheses that SARS-CoV-2 entry in oral epithelial cells is dependent on RGD-containing S protein association with RGD-binding integrins that act as a co-receptor with ACE2 and that this interaction underlying COVID-19 can be modulated by RGD-containing P2Y2Rs that bind to these same integrins. These studies potentially offer an innovative translational approach whereby patients undergoing dental procedures could be administered a P2Y2R or integrin modulator via mouthwash or mouth spray that would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into oral epithelial cells, thereby preventing viral transmission.","1, 6","1b, 6z"
P21467,Preclinical development of a vaccine for Nipah virus,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Nipah virus (NiV) causes febrile encephalitis and severe respiratory disease in humans with fatality rates as high  as 100% in some outbreaks (average ~ 75% for outbreaks over the last decade). There are currently no licensed  vaccines or therapies for combating NiV disease. NiV is classified as a Biosafety Level (BSL)-4 pathogen  because of the high mortality rates associated with infection, the lack of effective medical countermeasures, and  the ease of transmission. In addition to causing morbidity and mortality as a naturally acquired infection, NiV is  also categorized as a Category C priority pathogen by several US Government agencies because of the concern  for deliberate misuse. Importantly, NiV was recently included on the World Health OrganizationÃ¢Â€Â™s (WHO) 2018  List of Priority Pathogens. As a result of the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 there is heightened  concern and awareness regarding respiratory pathogens. Consequently, in March of 2020 the US CDC  recommended that NiV be added to the list of Tier 1 Select Agents. Studies to develop effective countermeasures  have been hampered by the highly pathogenic nature of NiV and its restriction to BSL-4 containment. An effective  prophylactic vaccine would find application with medical personnel and close contacts during outbreaks and with  laboratory workers engaged in research. A vaccine based on recombinant G protein deleted (ÃŽÂ""G) vesicular  stomatitis virus (rVSVÃŽÂ""G) pseudotyped with the glycoproteins (GP) of a number of high consequence viruses  have been shown to completely protect nonhuman primates (NHP) against Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses.  In addition, the effectiveness of a rVSV-vectored vaccine in preventing Ebola virus disease was demonstrated  in a ring vaccination, open-label, cluster-randomised trial in Guinea during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic. This  vaccine was recently licensed as ERVEBO by the European Union and US FDA. Recently, we developed  replication-restricted rVSV NiV vaccine vectors expressing the NiV glycoproteins. Importantly, we showed that  these vaccines can completely protect NHPs against high dose lethal NiV Bangladesh strain challenge when  used as single injection vaccines. This new data is critically important in the context of containing outbreaks as  the most effective vaccine in containing a respiratory pathogen and preventing a pandemic is a vaccine that  works rapidly with a single administration. Development of a replication restricted platform that provides improved  safety without compromising efficacy is a highly significant advancement and can be applied to other viruses  with pandemic potential. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a rVSV-based vaccine against NiV  (rVSV-NiVBG) that can provide both rapid protection and long term immunity against the most prevalent and  pathogenic Bangladesh strain of NiV and to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict protection. In regard  to product development, work will also be done to generate research cell bank (RCB) and viral vaccine bank  (RVB), a manufacturing process, and conduct of GLP-safety toxicology.",7,7a
C07132,Stanford MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center,"Abstract: Control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and related pathogenic processes requires an understanding of how host and viral genetics factors drive disease outcome.     The study is designed to characterize the genomic epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) and define host genetic effects on the outcome of viral infection. We will whole-genome sequence 1,000 COVID-19 positive patients at Stanford Health Care as part of this research study. Stanford University Hospitals and Clinics has piloted a robust and reproducible next-generation sequencing assay for joint viral and host genome detection.     An initial pilot of 319 nasal swab samples and 15 Buffy coats from ICU patients demonstrates we are able to extract, sequence and analyze low pass host genomes and RNA seq data on all nasal swabs. Of these swabs,we were able to obtain full viral genome sequences from 180. Genetic ancestry analysis of the 319 host genomes shows overrepresentation of Hispanic/Latinos, Pacific Islanders, and other at-risk populations, recapitulating the ethnic disparity we and others have seen among cases.     In this project, we will sequence additional samples to bring our total to 1,000 COVID-19 positive samples including inpatient, outpatient, severe, and critically ill patients. We will scale this project over the next 12 months and follow infected, severe,critical, and recovered patients to characterize the multiomic profile of disease severity from mild to severe to critically ill.     This will be accomplished through two Aims.   The first aim focuses on host genetic sequencing from NP swabs where we expect to recover sufficient genetic material to characterize the host genome to high imputation quality. We will also characterize host genetic ancestry and background polygenic risk score for ahost of related traits. A set of 100 contemporaneous COVID-19 negative samples will also be sequenced as controls and comparison for background ancestry in the treatment population. In parallel we will collect DTC derived genetic data from a diverse population sample.     Our second aim focuses on the virus genome data obtained from NP swabs. We will fully characterize as much of the SARS-CoV-2 genome per sample as possible and detect co-infections in the swab sample. Our goal is to understand the limit of detection for the technology, impact on reproducing viral dynamics, and characterizing alternative splicing in the SARS-CoV-2 genome over the time course of infection.     Completion of the Aims outlined here will pilot Next Generation Sequencing for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 host and viral genetics in Northern California that can be replicated across the world. This is critical for preparedness of a second wave and detecting co-infections among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contributes significantly to the emergency tracking of the pandemic during the second half of 2020 and beyond.",1,1c

We now propose to use this successful approach to a second infectiousdisease, SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event in modern human history, with morbidity and mortality ratesdangerously high in the elderly and those with medical comorbidities. Given the current pandemic status, themost urgent goal is to lower case fatality and hospitalization rates. Front line providers need reliable tests torapidly triage infected patients according to severity and effective therapies to treat them. There is reason forhope; the mean time between presentation and need for hospitalization is a week for SARS-CoV-2 infectedpatients, which allows a much longer window to intervene than for influenza infection; clinical trials are alreadyassessing various small molecular agents and neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the goals of this application are touse an existing prospective cohort to assess multiple potential biomarkers of progression to severe disease atinitial clinical presentation, identify immunologic variables associated with viral elimination over ensuing weeks,and model the optimal timing, dose and duration of therapeutic interventions to prevent respiratory failure. Wewill leverage the currently surging local epidemic in Seattle; an IRB-approved protocol which is already enrollinginfected outpatient participants; a wide network of referring providers; and our multi-disciplinary team ofclinicians, T-cell immunologists, and mathematical modelers, who have existing, complementary tools andexisting collaborations, to rapidly produce and analyze critical data.

P23355,Responses to COVID-19 through social protection and the strengthening of local food systems: Case of the Niayes in Senegal (COVID19-Agriculture and Food Security),"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact in the Sahel region of West Africa, which is already facing several protracted crises, including environmental degradation, poverty, conflict, rural exodus, and gender inequality. Although Senegal launched several economic and financial measures to strengthen health systems and support the most vulnerable households, businesses, and the diaspora, large parts of the primary sector were not specifically targeted by these measures and have been suffering. The multidimensional shocks of COVID-19 have reinforced existing vulnerabilities in local food systems and created new ones. The lack of structure and professionalism of agricultural value chains, pervasiveness of informal distribution channels, weak financing, lack of storage and conservation infrastructure, and uncertainties related to product quality, have all been exacerbated by the pandemic.     This project will generate knowledge and support tools to improve decision-making for social protection mechanisms and strengthen local food systems in the Niayes region of Senegal. Highly influenced by nearby urban markets, the Niayes region provides a fertile ground for identifying critical points in local food systems that affect the delivery of essential food items to urban, peri-urban, and rural populations. The project will analyze government and stakeholder responses to food and nutrition insecurity, document the impact of government and stakeholders'Äô interventions to strengthen the resilience of food systems, and explore the best way to respond to future shocks and support food systems.     This project is supported through IDRC'Äôs rapid research response to the COVID-19 crisis. This response mechanism supports the development of new short-term activities as a supplement to existing projects, to document the impact of the pandemic (and control measures) on local food systems and on food security, to document planned and spontaneous responses to the emerging crisis, and to inform responses to the current crisis and future challenges.","9, 10","9e, 10b, 10d"
C15167,"Cell entry, cross-species transmission and pathogenesis of novel coronavirus from","The 21st century has recorded the emergence of three highly pathogenic respiratory coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, the ongoing Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2013 and a novel SARS-like coronaviruses SARS-CoV2 (SARS2) in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019. SARS2 causes COVID19, a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has infected 95000 individuals with ~20% severe cases and a ~3% mortality rate, resulting in over 3700 deaths. In the elderly, mortality rates approach 15%. The overall program goals are to identify the viral and host determinants, which regulate the atomic-level interactions between the SARS2 S-glycoprotein and various ACE2 receptor and associated entry components such as cellular proteases. The impact of these studies are high, as these interactions regulate 2019-nHCoV species specificity and host tropism, which play critical roles in viral pathogenesis and inform the evolutionary pathways leading to virus emergence and spread in humans and perhaps other intermediate hosts. In parallel, we apply these and other findings to developing robust mouse models of SARS2-mediated human disease, which is critical for not only evaluating viral pathogenesis but also for future testing of antiviral drugs, immunotherapeutics and vaccines.","1, 2","1b, 1e"
P23319,Generating knowledge and building networks for science advice in emergencies,"The COVID-19 pandemic, like climate change and other major threats, is pervasive worldwide. This recognition is at the core of the UN'Äôs 2030 Agenda and embedded within each of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet a clear understanding of our shared threats and the means to mitigate them is less well developed. This is in part because the required structures for government science advice are often weak or absent, particularly in the Global South.     Since 2014, the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA) has been at the vanguard of global efforts to instil evidence-based policymaking by drawing on national science systems as a major part of efforts to advance the SDGs. These efforts included a three-year IDRC-funded initiative from 2017 to support research, training, and networking in the Global South, under the auspices of the International Science Council. In 2020, INGSA'Äôs work has taken a new and urgent turn in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic, acting as a conduit between national public health agencies and research organizations and establishing a platform of information sharing and data collection about how related policy decisions are being made.     This project will build on INGSA'Äôs earlier work involving the Global South and on its initial efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will focus on ideas, institutions, individuals, and modes of integration that can greatly enhance how science advice occurs in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, with an emphasis on responses to the pandemic and to emergencies more generally. It will support a comprehensive comparative study of COVID-19 responses through original research, including the creation of a new global platform for tracking related policies as well as 'Äúdeep-dive'Äù case studies. This will help governments better prepare for transnational crises by using high-quality scientific evidence.     In parallel, the project will pilot a regional network of high-level science advisors linked to a policy intelligence platform for Southeast Asia and explore scaling out possibilities for other regions. Finally, it will rely on INGSA'Äôs three regional chapters in Asia, Latin America, and Africa to generate new knowledge and regional insights, promote science advice to policymakers, and integrate information across regions, with an early emphasis on COVID-19.",9,9e
P22894,Biomimetic nanoparticles to enhance the breadth of influenza vaccines,"Abstract  Current influenza (flu) vaccines are effective only for closely matched flu viral strains and must be updated  annually to address constant antigenic shift/drifts of surface hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) of  the virus. Even with annual update, there have been years in which flu vaccines were ineffective due to  significant differences in antigenicity of HA and/or NA between the strains used for preparing the vaccines and  the circulating ones, leaving us at high risk of pandemics in case a new and highly pathological virus emerges.  It is without any doubt that a Universal flu vaccine that can protect against both seasonal (matched or  mismatched) and pandemic flu viruses is urgently needed, but it remains an alchemist's dream  so far. We  developed a novel adjuvant by encapsulation of cGAMP, an agonist of the stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene  (STING), into pulmonary surfactant (PS)-biomimetic liposomes (PS-GMNP). The adjuvant, alongside an  inactivated flu vaccine, robustly stimulated humoral and CD8+ T cell immune responses that resemble those  ocurring during the early phase of viral infection both in magnitude and in dynamics. Strikingly, a single dose of  PS-GMNP-adjuvant flu vaccine elicited strong cross-protection against a lethal challenge of diverse  heterosubtypic flu A viruses as early as 2 days after immunization. While stimulating robust heterosubtypic  immunity, the adjuvant did not cause any adverse events in lung histology, body weight or temperature, in  sharp contrast to the severe lung inflammation and death caused by flu viral infection. In this proposal, we will  investigate the cellular and humoral immune responses essential to the cross-protection induced by PS-  GMNP-adjuvanted flu vaccines. Specifically, we will determine whether PS-GMNP can expand cross-reactive  CD8+ T cells and induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), pivotal to PS-GMNP-induced cross-  protection. In Aim 2, we will preclude any adverse effects of pre-existing immunity on the adjuvanticity of PS-  GMNP and extend the cross-protection to pre-pandemic wild type H5N1 and H7N9 viruses to establish its  clinical potentials. Distinguished from conventional adjuvants that activate primarily antigen-presenting cells  (APCs), cGAMP delivered by PS-GMNP activated both alveolar macrophages (aMÃ‰Â¸) and alveolar epithelial  cells (AEC), which can be crucial since similar activation of these two types of cells is also observed during flu  viral infection. Two alternative approaches will be employed in Aim 3 to corroborate indispensable function of  AEC and/or aMÃ‰Â¸ in PS-GMNP-mediated heterosubtypic immunity, including a blockade of cell-gap junctions  and generation of chimeric mice of wild type and STING-deficient bone marrow (BM) cells. The study, if  successful, could provide invaluable information about clinical potentials for PS-GMNP to widen the breadth of  existing flu vaccines toward a Ã¢Â€ÂœUniverseÃ¢Â€Â one, which will have a huge and immediate impact on global health.","1, 7","1d, 7a"

P22927,Rapid Manufacturing of a Universal Flu Vaccine Using TMV-conjugated Centralized Antigens,"Project Abstract  This interdisciplinary proposal brings together three highly successful but independent technologies to create  an effective and broadly neutralizing universal influenza vaccine. Our approach combines breath of immunity,  by using a consensus HA strategy, production speed and capacity by working with Kentucky BioProcessing  (KBP), who can express HA protein in plants, and vastly improved subunit vaccine potency using a TMV-HA  conjugation approach to create a candidate universal influenza virus vaccine. Based on our preclinical data on  three influenza A strains, we expect our approach will drive long term immunity that is balanced between  antibody and cellular immunity, providing potential for overlapping mechanisms of immune protection. We  bring together a strong team of different disciplines with a combined goal to quickly show proof of concept with  H1, H3, H5, and M2e antigens. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1) Production of TMV-HA conjugates of  centralized H1, H3, H5 genes and M2e peptide, 2) Immune response analysis, murine challenge studies and  3) Translational and ferret studies of TMV-HAc and TMV-M2e vaccines. Dr. Weaver has developed a  computational method to express an ancestral sequence of HA, representing a consensus of sequences within  an Influenza subtype. These vaccines protect against drifted seasonal influenza variants better than a  traditional trivalent inactivated virus vaccine. In partnership with KBP, we will use established plant expression  methods to produce centralized HA proteins, with the capacity to produce protein for the planned studies and  for future clinical trial development. HA consensus protein will be fused to the surface of Tobacco Mosaic virus  (TMV) by chemical conjugation, a method developed by Dr. McCormick to improve HA subunit vaccine  potency. TMV-HA vaccines will also be combined with a highly conserved M2e peptide vaccine, to broaden  protection and reduce vaccine dose. Immunological analysis will be used to confirm vaccine potency, in order  to optimize dose, schedule and route of administration. Vaccine efficacy and broadly protective immunity will  be confirmed by lethal influenza challenge using 9 divergent virus types in a murine model of disease. Finally,  vaccine formulations will be re-tested in ferrets, a models of influenza infection which more closely mimics the  progress of disease in humans. Our vaccine is designed to drive local and systemic immunity after either  intranasal or intramuscular routes of administration, and we will use immunogenicity and pathogen challenge  data to define an optimized single dose vaccine formulation. Our goal is to generate an effective universal  vaccine against influenza that can be manufactured at scale, with significant potential for translation into a  universal vaccine product that is ready for clinical testing.",7,7a
P23218,Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics,"PROJECT SUMMARY  When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions  that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will  there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world  instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current  methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15  West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the  2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and  prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are  typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission  mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on  the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations,  particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching  scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical  covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to  confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to  forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches;  (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making  in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory  to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop  accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics.  We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches  to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned  above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that  occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed  are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to  epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting  and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical  approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during  public health crises.",3,"3c, 3d"
C06796,Determining Optimal Treatment Intensity for Children with Language Impairment (LI),"Project Summary/Abstract This urgent revision will determine the optimal treatment intensity for children with language impairment (LI), provided via telepractice platforms, by systematically manipulating treatment dose and frequency. This study will also investigate the moderating influence of the home environment on children's outcomes. This study aim is urgent in that over 1 million children with LI are no longer receiving language services in the public schools, as prescribed by their IEPs, due to COVID-19. Children instead are either receiving supplemental resource packets or receiving therapy via telepractice - a grossly understudied platform for service provision for this population. Preliminary studies of children with LI in the public schools suggest that children with LI who received high frequency/low dose treatment (or low frequency/high dose) made better gains over time than children receiving the extremes (overall low or high intensity of treatment; Schmitt et al., 2017). These preliminary findings are correlational in nature; the current study aims to manipulate both parameters of intensity (dose and frequency) to determine not only the interactive influence of dose and frequency on children's gains, but also the extent to which factors of the home environment - now a primary learning environment for school age children - influence the dose and frequency required to realize language gains. To address these aims, the proposed study will utilize the methods proposed in the parent study of optimal treatment intensity now on a telepractice platform. Participants (60 children with LI recruited from two US states) will be randomized into one of two frequency conditions (massed vs spaced) in which they will receive a word learning intervention previously tested through NIH funding by Holly Storkel and colleagues (e.g., Storkel et al., 2017). The intervention identifies 60 new vocabulary targets which are presented to children within story book readings using rich vocabulary intervention strategies. For the purposes of the proposed study, each vocabulary target (n = 60) will be randomized to one of six possible dose exposures (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20) for each child. SLP interns will deliver the manualized word learning intervention in one-on-one sessions for 10 weeks via telepractice platforms. Comprehensive measures of the child's home environment will be collected before treatment, all via questionnaires and online interviews. Children's vocabulary skills will be measured via telepractice at three time points: pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment, and 6-months post treatment to assess the impact of the intensity regimens on outcomes. Analyses will specify a dose-response curve to identify the point of optimal gain children receive from treatment as well as moderating influences of the home environment. Findings will immediately inform practice for school-based SLPs during the COVID-19 crisis as well as provide intensity parameters and familial considerations for future clinical trials.","10, 11","10b, 10d, 11a"
C03880,The role of serotonin signaling in the nucleus accumbens in excessive alcohol drinking,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTNeurological complications of SARS-CoV2 or Covid-19 have been reported in the literature but little is knownabout the extent to which neural systems are affected by this disease or the long-term impact on brain function.Alcohol consumption during the Covid-19 pandemic is on the rise due to factors such as unemployment, financialstrain, and loss of social support and may be a significant risk factor for neurological complications of SARS-CoV2. Other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV are thought to gain entry to the brain via the olfactory bulb andquickly spread to interconnected regions such as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which is a major source ofserotonin (5-HT) neurons in the brain that orchestrates neurological functions ranging from autonomic control toemotional and motivated behavior. Alcohol is also known to compromise the function of 5-HT neurons in thebrain and may render them more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV2, exacerbating the neuropsychiatricsequelae of this disease. The goal of the present application is to determine whether alcohol can increaseexpression of known entry factors for SARS-CoV2 in DRN 5-HT neurons and facilitate infection of these neurons.In Aim 1, we will determine whether chronic intermittent alcohol exposure upregulates expression of entry factorsACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 5-HT DRN neurons that project to the olfactory bulb using retrograde tracers. In Aim 2,we will determine whether SARS-CoV2 can infect 5-HT DRN neurons via the olfactory bulb and whether chronicintermittent alcohol exacerbates infection and death of these neurons. Together, these studies will revealwhether alcohol is a significant risk factor for SARS-CoV2 invasion of the CNS and whether the DRN 5-HTsystems is a target for this infection.","3, 4","3b, 4a"
P23534,Combating 2019-nCoV: Advanced Nanobiosensing platforms for POC global diagnostics and surveillance,"The recent outbreak in China caused by the emerging nCoV virus is challenging the level of global readiness from governments, public organizations and community to face and manage both its social and health consequences. Once the emergence is recognized and identified, it is crucial to initiate the necessary measures to prevent the spread. This involves therapeutics, vaccines, and devising efficient, fast, readily accessible diagnostics methods that specifically confirm the presence of the virus. Early detection can allow the rapid implementation of containment measures, which are the key to reduce the risk of amplification. The aim of CoNVat is to implement a Point-of-care label free biosensor for the direct, fast and specific identification of nCoV in decentralized settings to improve its early diagnosis and the clinical management of patients. The approach employs an already developed technology based on nanophotonic bimodal waveguide (BiMW) interferometers capable of providing real time, highly sensitive detections assays in short sample turnaround times. We propose two different strategies: (i) the development of a fast antigen-based diagnostic test for the specific detection of the intact virus in patient'Äôs samples such as respiratory specimens and non-respiratory fluids (serum, urine'Ä¶) to be deployed to clinical settings for initial screening and (ii) development of a multiplexed molecular test, PCR-free, for the reliable identification of nCoV, being possible to differentiate the type and strain of coronavirus form other related or more common respiratory viruses. This latter strategy will provide a disruptive diagnostic tool not only from a clinical perspective to improve patient'Äôs outcome but also for surveillance, to study and understand possible transmission routes of this virus by analysing samples from animal reservoirs. Final prototype validation will demonstrate the potential of this approach for the management of future infectious outbreaks.",1,1a
P23770,Quartromicins; Enantioselective Total Synthesis and Generating Molecular Libraries of Drug-like Bioactive Compounds.,"Nature is an indispensable source of bioactive compounds, but not necessarily an ideal provider of bulk or analogs. Total synthesis plays an important role in generating new analogs of natural molecules and as a means to reduce dependency on natural resources. The outbreak of COVID-19 and other viruses has posed a significant global threat, the urgent need arises to study and discover new antiviral. It has become imperative for researchers to develop strategic research plans in order to synthesize medicines to combat these viruses. Quartromicins are well known for their antiviral properties but barely explored due to no known synthesis to date and low isolation yield (0.36-0.06%) makes them an attractive target molecule for the total synthesis for further investigation and development to combat the viruses. With this proposal, we address the synthetic aspects of the main bioactive molecules and their analogs being considered to be repositioned for the effective treatment of viral infections. The first total synthesis of Quartromicins A1, A2, A3, D1, D2, D3 is proposed by a convergent synthetic strategy that involves the use of an enantioselective Diels-Alder reaction, the carbonyl-ene reaction mediated by organocatalyst, and the Heck dimerizing coupling reaction as the key step to the macrocyclization. The endo adduct is proposed to be readily synthesized by the enantioselective Diels-Alder reaction while the exo unit by a carbonyl-ene reaction, both mediated by the organocatalyst. The exo & endo fragments are proposed to be transformed to the corresponding exo & endo-spirotetronate fragments by simple organic transformations. Finally, the symmetrical Quartromicins A1, A3, D1 & D3 and unsymmetrical Quartromicins A2 & D2 can be synthesized by the Heck dimerizing coupling and the Heck double cross-coupling reactions respectively.

P22768,Seasonal and universal Vaccination in aged populations with pre-existing immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Current influenza (flu) vaccination based on hypervariable hemagglutinin (HA) protein fails to provide  effective cross protection. The efficacy of vaccination is low in the aged populations even with pre-existing  immunity. The impacts of pre-existing immunity on the immunogenicity and efficacy of universal and seasonal  vaccination largely remain not well understood in the aged populations. Development of new flu vaccines and  vaccination strategies improving cross protective efficacy in young naÃƒÂ¯ve and aged hosts with pre-existing  immunity is of high priority. Mono conserved antigenic targets inducing cross protection tested in naÃƒÂ¯ve animal  models include the flu A virus M2 extracellular domain (M2e), HA-stalk domains, and neuraminidase (NA) were  reported but insufficient for translation to humans. The multi-target universal vaccines in naÃƒÂ¯ve and aged hosts  with pre-existing immunity remain to be developed.   We developed heterologous tandem repeat of M2e (5xM2e) presented on immunogenic virus-like  particles (5xM2e VLP). Vaccination with 5xM2e VLP was effective in broadening cross protection but  suboptimal. A further improved universal vaccine should be developed. Our preliminary studies found  synergistic effects on improving cross protection by both M2e and NA immunity. Therefore, as a new universal  vaccine candidate, we developed a multi NA + 5xM2e VLP vaccine containing multi-subtype NA and 5xM2e on  the same VLP particle. In addition, we newly designed genetically linked novel recombinant M2e-stalk  universal protein vaccines effectively inducing both M2e and HA-stalk immunity and conferring broad cross-  group protection. Adjuvanted universal vaccination will overcome the aging-related immune senescence by  activating T and B immune cells in naÃƒÂ¯ve hosts or aged populations under pre-existing immunity.   In this project, we will test the hypothesis that new universal vaccination inducing multi immunity (M2e,  Stalk, NA) will enhance the breadth and efficacy of cross protection in adult and aged populations with or  without pre-existing immunity. Under Aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of multi-target universal vaccines in  young adult mice and ferrets under naÃƒÂ¯ve and pre-existing immune conditions. In Aim 2 studies, we will  determine the durability of cross protective immunity by multi targeting new universal vaccines and test a  vaccination strategy enhancing cross protection in aged mouse and ferret animal models. In the Aim 3, we will  investigate cross protective immune mechanisms of multi targeting universal vaccination in young and aged  mouse models. The outcomes in this project will be highly significant in the aspect of translational science and  relevance to improve the cross protective efficacy of flu vaccination.","1, 7","1d, 7a, 7l"
C20731,Point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19 using isothermal amplification and CRISPR technology,"This research addresses the urgent need of rapid point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19. The collaborative research is conducted by a multi-disciplinary team of virologists, chemists, infectious disease specialists, front-line practitioners, and public health researchers from the University of Alberta, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Wuhan Institute of Virology (China).   The immediate priority focuses on developing two complementary techniques to be performed on-site and in resource-limited settings, in support of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnostic innovation takes advantage of the most recent advances in chemistry, molecular biology, genome technology, and nanotechnology. Chemical reactions required for efficient amplification and sensitive detection of the viral RNA take place in a single tube at a moderate temperature, simplifying the operation procedures. The specific reaction products are visible to the naked eyes, thus eliminating the need for any elaborate equipment. The first test reads color changes, with red color indicating negative and blue color indicating positive. Readout for the second test is color band on paper strips, similar to those of pregnancy tests, with two red bands indicating positive whereas a single control band indicating negative.   The mid-term priority focuses on validating and evaluating the new diagnostic tests for field applications in the epidemic center of COVID-19. Our team members in Wuhan who currently perform the standard diagnostic tests will lead this effort. Once validated and approved, the new diagnostic tools will be used to support screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 at the community level. The mid-term objective also includes adapting the point-of-care diagnostics at other collaborating sites, e.g., Karachi (Pakistan) and Nairobi (Kenya).

There is urgent need for crisis-resilient solutions of high-quality childcare provision reaching all families in order to mitigate the impact of future waves of Covid- 19-infections. The objectives of this project are two-fold: firstly, it will collate an evidence-base providing the most comprehensive picture on how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected families' childcare  arrangements and wellbeing in the short and longer term. This will include collection of rich new data (in-depth interviews with parents and stakeholders) identifying the specific childcare needs and challenges of families in different circumstances (including socio-economic background, protected characteristics and geographical area), and its triangulation with secondary analysis of a  wide range of data-sources on Covid-19 impact (including nationally representative surveys and convenience samples). Secondly, in partnership with local and national stakeholders and policymakers, the project will develop a co-produced policy-toolkit providing community-based implementation and practice pathways to support Local Councils' crisis responses and to inform  national early years and school-care policy. The innovative project-design combining a comprehensive array of data analysis with a collaborative co-production strategy for local service solutions will be pioneering in designing resilient childcare provision that protects family wellbeing during this pandemic and beyond.",10,"10a,10b"

C06863,MIcrophysiological systems to model vascular malformations,"PROJECT SUMMARYCOVID19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel member of the human coronavirus family that includes the closelyrelated SARS-CoV (SARS) and MERS-CoV (MERS) viruses. SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein binds to humanangiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of cells and is then primed by the serine/threonineprotease TMPRS22, whereupon the entire complex is internalized by the target cell. ACE2 is expressed bymultiple cell types of the body, including lung and gut epithelium (likely the primary sites of initial infection) andvascular endothelial cells (EC) of multiple organs. In addition to the well-described pneumonia-like diseasecharacterized by compromised lung function with subsequent depressed pO2 levels in blood, patients often alsoshow signs of multi-organ involvement, which can include gut, kidney, liver, heart, and brain. Most recently,numerous pediatric patients have been showing signs of Kawasaki disease, a systemic vascular inflammation.Over 30% of COVID19 ICU patients also show signs of thrombosis and 25% suffer venous embolism. Cerebralischemia, likely due to clot formation, has also been reported. What is not clear is whether this multi-organinvolvement is due to secondary infection of these tissues or whether these are all a consequence of systemichyperinflammation. The sequence of events that could drive systemic hyperinflammation stems from the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection. Angiotensin II (AngII) is an important vasoconstrictor and under normalphysiological conditions its level is closely controlled through rapid degradation by ACE2, however, SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells clears ACE2 from the cell surface, potentially prolonging the action of AngII. Primaryconsequences of this would be two-fold: prolonged vasoconstriction in the lung (exacerbating poor oxygenationof the blood by the already compromised lungs) and a shift toward a pro-inflammatory state, as it is wellestablished that AngII can drive local vascular inflammation, in large part through the induction of IL-6 in EC andsmooth muscle cells (SMC). IL-6 is one of the major drivers of systemic hyperinflammation, and in its mostsevere form, a so-called ""cytokine storm"". IL-6 is also strongly correlated with thrombosis, likely throughupregulation of tissue factor on EC and macrophages, and by downregulation of thrombomodulin on EC.Through the parent award we have generated Vascularized Micro-Organs (VMOs), comprised of perfusedhuman vasculature and a surrounding stroma, and have further developed these into Vascularized Micro-Brains(VMBs) incorporating a Blood-Brain Barrier, and Vascularized Micro-Livers (VMLs). Additional cells, includingmacrophages and SMC have also been incorporated into the VMO. Using these platforms we will address threehypotheses: 1) That the VMO can be used to assess the ability of convalescent serum, soluble ACE2 or smallmolecule inhibitors to block entry of a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus; 2) That sustained AngII expression cantrigger a hyperinflammatory response from EC and macrophages; and 3) That hyperinflammation cancompromise peripheral and BBB vasculature as well as liver function.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"

C15222,RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase Assays for Biochemical Characterization and Antiviral Drug Discovery,"SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus that relies on its RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp) for survival. Within the months of April and May, five groups have independently reported  the production of recombinant SAR-CoV-2 RdRp and a preliminary activity assessment of this essential enzyme.  Included in these studies was direct evidence that the triphosphate version of the nucleoside analogue  remdesivir, which has received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to treat  SARS-CoV-2, is incorporated in place of ATP into the growing RNA oligonucleotide, ultimately leading to chain  termination. Other nucleobase and nucleoside analogues including EIDD-1931 and favipiravir, the latter of which  has been approved in Japan to treat the (-)ssRNA influenza virus, have demonstrated promise as therapeutic  agents against SARS-CoV-2 by likely interfering with RNA metabolism via inhibition or processing as alternative  substrates for RdRp. This and other data suggest that RdRp is an excellent target for the discovery and  development of novel SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. However, one of the major bottlenecks in exploiting RdRp as  a drug target is the relatively low throughput activity-based assays that are costly, prone to interference, and/or  lack flexibility in the experimental design. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a broadly applicable  RdRp activity-based assay that will be used for antiviral drug discovery efforts. Our specific aim is to establish a  novel, real-time assay using a five-enzyme coupled system with a colorimetric readout. The new assay will be  directly compared to the traditional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a liquid scintillation proximity end-  point assay, and further validated with high resolution mass spectrometry. It is expected that, by accomplishing  this aim, the assay will enable a thorough biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and, for the first  time, enable the testing of synthetic compound and natural product libraries to identify inhibitors, alternative  substrates, modulators, or effectors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity in a high throughput screening format. Notably,  the strategy implemented herein is expected to complement on-going structural-based anti-SARS-CoV-2  discovery efforts. Finally, the activity-based assay can be readily adapted for RdRp from other (+)ssRNA and (-  )ssRNA viruses in an effort to identify therapeutics against a broad spectrum of pandemic-causing viruses.",1,"1a, 1b"

The team has a longtrack record of prior work in basic and translational studies in the setting of viral infections,vaccines and cancer. The program consists of 3 interacting projects and two essentialcores in addition to the administrative core. Studies in project 1 (led by Sanz) will studythe biology of SARS CoV-2 specific effector B cell responses in patients withautoimmunity, with a particular focus on extrafollicular B cell pathway. Studies in project2 (led by Sekaly and Wrammert) will study the role of inflammatory milieu in regulatingantiviral immunity and in the development of long term memory responses. Studies inproject 3 (led by Dhodapkar and Ahmed) will focus on studying the impact of specificcancer therapies, in particular B/plasma cell depleting therapies in patients with B/plasmacell malignancies, and immune checkpoint blockade in patients with lung cancer. Thesestudies will also set the stage for studying immune responses to future SARS CoV-2vaccines in patients with autoimmunity as well as cancer patients. The programs aresupported by active cores (led by Roback and Neish) which have experience withmonitoring immunity to SARS CoV-2. Together, this program will not only provide basicinsights into immune-pathogenesis of COVID, but also provide the consortium withaccess to unique patient populations at higher risk of COVID-related mortality.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"
C03042,CovidFree @ Home:  Development and validation of a multivariable prediction model of deterioration in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who are managing at home [Added supplement: COVID-19 Variant Supplement],"Millions of Canadians are anticipated to be infected with COVID-19 during this pandemic and many more will contract it in ongoing community transmission and/or a possible second wave. The majority of people who test positive for COVID-19 are sent home to isolate. In this population, deterioration of their disease can happen quickly and without warning, and we currently cannot accurately predict the approximately 20% who deteriorate and need hospitalization. From discussions with our patients and patient advisor, we know that people who are isolating at home feel terrified and alone.    We need an effective and safe ambulatory care and research strategy for people with COVID-19 isolating at home.   We are a team of heath care workers, patients, researchers and computer scientists (WearCOPD.ca; Can-BREATHE.ca) with five years of experience developing and using remote monitoring systems for respiratory disease. We have already built a smartphone application to facilitate the care of people with COVID-19 at home by allowing them to report their symptoms to their physician. With this project, we will expand our system to also include continuous smartwatch-based monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, cough, speech and other parameters. Sensor data will provide us with large volumes of objective data and allow us to build accurate real time machine learning models for predicting who needs to go to hospital. We will integrate these models into a dashboard that alerts clinicians of any patients that area getting worse, so that they can be called into hospital. Patients can be reassured that they are being followed thoroughly even though they are at home. Our system will also provide a platform for further research into how to prevent long term sequalae and preserve the health of people with COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization.",4,"4b, 4c"

P21901,Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Center - East and Central Africa,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Since 2012 when the first human case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was  confirmed, the World Health Organization has reported >2220 human infections and almost 800 deaths spread  across 27 countries located in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Although dromedary camels  are the known reservoir of the virus, there is limited knowledge on the mechanisms and factors associated with  camel-to-human transmission, which remains the primary mechanism of human infections. Human outbreaks  and the number of documented cases of MERS-CoV continue to grow in the Middle East and Asia; however  there have, to date, been no documented cases of human disease in the eastern Africa countries where >65%  of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s dromedary camels are found. This is despite evidence of prevalent MERS-CoV infection of camels  in the region. The absence of human disease in East Africa may be explained by viral plasticity resulting in  inefficient transmission and/or weakened virulence, or poor disease surveillance and reporting among the  marginalized camel-owning nomadic pastoralist populations that inhabit remote arid lands of the regions. We will  test these hypotheses by conducting integrated longitudinal cohort studies within a closed community of naÃƒÂ¯ve  pastoralists and their camel population that is known to sustain MERS-CoV circulation in Marsabit County,  Kenya, in order to determine the maintenance and transmission of the virus among camels, zoonotic  transmission to humans, and severity of human infections. To determine if the circulating MERS-CoV is  genetically and phenotypically distinct from known virus clades in the Middle East and Asia, we will isolate the  East African virus by collecting samples biweekly from an infant cohort (birth -1 year) of 211 camels, followed by  culture and isolation of the virus to performed genotypic and phenotypic comparison with the known clade viruses  To investigate whether a combination of weak surveillance and poor access to health care are responsible for  absence of disease, we will follow-up for a year, a cohort of 573 camel handlers through biweekly visits, weekly  telephone calls, and access to a toll-free number in order to intensively examine and test them for MERS-CoV  disease. In addition, we will identify, test, and follow-up >4500 in- and out-patients with respiratory illness at  Marsabit County Referral Hospital for 3 years. To assess the risk the virus poses to humans, we will determine  the level of viral shedding in camels, and relate this to the incidence of zoonotic transmission, and types of camel  contact that increase transmission risk. These studies will identify the type of virus circulating in East Africa,  increasing knowledge about plasticity of MERS-CoV and its impact on zoonotic transmission and disease. By  elucidating the frequency and mechanisms of zoonotic transmission, and progression to clinical human disease,  we will define the risk the virus poses to this community at the frontline of a newly emergent virulent virus by  virtue of their occupation and lifestyle, paving the way for development of improved surveillance and appropriate  prevention and control strategies.","1, 2, 3","1b, 1c, 2a, 3a, 3b, 3d"
C15104,Structure-guided and epitope-based design of potent and broadly neutralizing nanobodies for COVID-19 mucosal immunotherapy,"Project Summary  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly disseminated through the human population  and became a global pandemic. Significant efforts have been put into developing vaccines or  antibody therapies based on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. One challenge of such  strategies is to identify conserved epitopes on the Spike and predict viral mutations that could  diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine and immunotherapy. To date, over 20 variant of SARS-  CoV-2 genome sequences have been reported. Therefore, structure guided and epitope based  design are crucial to generate effective medicines for current and future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-  2 or related coronavirus. Nanobodies can recognize conserved epitopes on hypervariable  pathogens. Here, we propose that anti-spike nanobodies can be utilized for rapid identification of  protective epitopes to inform design of vaccine and therapeutics. Further, we hypothesize that  potent and broadly protective nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be developed as an inhaled  prophylactic or therapeutic medicine.  In this proposal, we will leverage our complementary strengths through a multi-disciplinary  approach combining mucosal immunology, structural biology, and virology, to characterize the  molecular interactions and differential specificities of a diverse panel of nanobodies against spike  of SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Betacoronaviruese family (Aim 1). A comprehensive  list of conserved and non-conserved epitopes (Aim 2) will be used for structure-based design of  potent nanobody multimers for in vivo characterization (Aim 3).",1,1d

As of June, 2021, over 171 million laboratory-confirmed  cases and greater than 3.68 million deaths have been reported globally. This increase in cases has been  associated with emergence of new variants which have increased transmissibility and severity. While  Southeast Asia kept COVID-19 cases under relative control in 2020. In 2021, SARS-CoV-2 began to spread  rapidly and caused continuing outbreaks in the region. In Africa, the genomic surveillance gap, combined  with very fragile health systems with limited management capacities, exposes the continent to possible new  COVID-19 waves that could prove to be much more severe on the continent, where vaccination clearly  remains at a very timid stage. The overall goal of the project is to increase sequencing capacity and add to  the depth of sequencing knowledge available in South East Asia and African countries with 4 Specific Aims.  1)To increase sequencing numbers for samples from certain regions. We will focus on samples from  land borders with Thailand and Vietnam and community transmission in Cambodia stemming from the  February 20th ""event."" These sequences will help to understand community transmission within Cambodia.  In Africa, we will increase sequencing numbers from samples from African countries with very low sequencing  coverage including Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Cabo-Verde,  Mauritania, Tunisia, Madagascar, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Central Africa Republic. We will confirm  known variants of concern as well as detection of potential local new variants. 2)To increase sequencing  numbers for samples from patients with atypical profiles. We will systematically collect data at  epidemiological level for demographical data, clinical symptoms, COVID-19 vaccination status, history of  COVID-19 in relation with patients. We will focus on re-infected patient samples, severe COVID-19 cases  and post-vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. 3) To monitor introduction and dissemination of  known VOCs using molecular sub-typing tools. We will help participating countries building up molecular  capacities to subtype known variants. 4) Identify viral genetic determinants of high transmissibility and  disease severity. Sequences from severe cases will be analyzed in comparison to the sequences from the  randomly selected group to identify viral genetic signatures associated to disease severity. Regarding the  transmissibility, we will rely on circulation dynamics of the detected variants in each country as well as in all  countries. Overall, the studies outlined in this proposal will rapidly add essential sequence data needed  regarding COVID-19 cases in lower-middle income, least-developed countries. They will provide the basis  for further study on inter-/intra-host variant emergence and vaccine escape in a unique population from a  least-developed country in an understudied, but vitally important, region of the world.","1, 3, 4","1a, 1c, 3b, 3d, 4a"
C19866,Uncovering the Wider Impact of COVID-19 Measures on the Lives of Children with Complex Care Needs and their Families,"Background. Children with complex care needs are a vulnerable population served by our pediatric health and social care systems. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, caregivers of children with complex care needs reported numerous gaps in programs and services including a lack of care coordination and communication between service providers. COVID-19 public health measures resulted in rapid changes to many health and social supports across the Maritime provinces that these families rely on to maintain and optimize health and well-being. It is unclear how these changes impacted children with complex care needs and their families.    Objectives. This research aims to understand how policy and services changes implemented in the Maritime during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the health and well-being of children with complex care needs and their families. This will be achieved by: 1) Mapping COVID-19 public health restrictions and service changes impacting this population; and 2) Exploring with families living with complex care needs how they experienced these changes.    Methods. We will work with our research partners to understand the experiences of families living with complex care needs in the Maritimes. We will conduct an environmental scan of publicly available documents to identify policy and service changes during the pandemic relevant to this population. We will also conduct interviews with policy makers to further understand the development and implementation of policy and service changes. Finally, we will interview children and caregivers from the Maritimes to explore their experiences with these changes.     Impact. Children and families with complex needs experience many service and support gaps in the Maritimes. Our approach will allow us to identify key components for building a responsive COVID-19 inter and intra provincial policy and service strategy to meet the needs of this vulnerable population.","9, 10","9a, 9e, 10a, 10d"

C07182,Community Driven Approach to Mitigate COVID 19 Disparities in Hawaii's Vulnerable Populations,"PROJECT SUMMARY/Abstract: The long-term goal of this proposal is to eliminate COVID-19 disparities among Hawaii's racial/ethnically diverseyet vulnerable populations including Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) living in rural andunderserved communities by integrating innovative SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with novel community-specificmessaging and education. Compounded by long-standing health disparities and socioeconomic challenges,NHPIs suffer from increased infection and mortality rates attributed to COVID-19. To date, NHPIs rank amongthe highest disproportionately burdened by SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. With the nation's highest Rt, a basicreproductive metric indicating the degree of viral spread, Hawaii's disaggregated NHPI data reveal furtherdisparities. Preliminary testing data collected by our partner, the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center(WCCHC), Hawaii's largest federally funded community health center, indicates a significant deficiency in testinguptake, especially among Pacific Islanders. Further, we observed under-representative coverage of testingamong youth (ages 5-19 years old) in NHPI communities, despite their higher than average infection rate. Otherfactors, including slow testing turnaround time and untested asymptomatic cases, complicate efforts to containfurther community spread. Given the looming public health concerns around re-opening businesses and schools,these gaps highlight the critical need for innovative approaches of effecting behavioral change coupled withnovel testing strategies to enhance access to all community members, including school-aged children/youth.Fortunately, our partnerships in Hawaii's culturally diverse populations offer a unique opportunity to augment thecurrent COVID-19 response with community knowledge and resilience. We propose the hypothesis thatcommunity-contextualized messaging disseminated by novel healthcare-school partnerships coupled with arobust community and patient-centered testing strategy will increase reach, access, uptake, and impact forCOVID-19 testing in vulnerable populations. To test this hypothesis, our multidisciplinary team aims to (1)evaluate SARS-CoV-2 testing data, identify gaps and barriers in testing, and augment community testingcapacity to increase uptake and (2) optimize and implement community-informed COVID-19 messaging andeducation with a novel community healthcare-school network partnership in the NHPI population across Hawaii.Building on our parent ""Ola HAWAII"" grant, this project leverages our existing Community Engagement,Biostatistics, and Administrative Cores with NHPI partnerships to augment the RADx-UP Coordinating and DataCollection Center for common evaluation metrics on COVID-19 testing-related outcomes and implementation.This will lay the foundation for an engaged community network primed for disseminating anticipated vaccines inHawaii's highest risk populations. Given the urgency to both improve public health safety and re-opening schools,results from this project may offer insights into an integrated model or toolkit from which health clinics and schoolsin underserved & vulnerable communities across the country might actively participate in abating this pandemic.",9,"9a, 9b, 9c"

The highest-  income American men live nearly 15 years longer on average than the lowest-income American men; the  corresponding gap for women is 10 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these disparities by income,  race, and other dimensions. Unfortunately, we currently lack information on how mortality rates due to COVID-  19 vary with individual income, because available U.S. population mortality data lacks information on income.  The absence of this information has hindered our ability to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and develop policies  to mitigate its impacts, particularly on disadvantaged and underserved populations, going forward. This project  will resolve these challenges by constructing a new public database of mortality rates incorporating  socioeconomic and demographic variables and covering the entire U.S. population. Using these data,  researchers will be able to analyze the sources of disparate impacts of COVID-19 on mortality across subgroups,  with the aim of understanding how to reduce health inequality in the pandemic and beyond. The project has  three specific aims. Aim 1 of this project is to release a new public database of mortality rates by age, income,  race/ethnicity, gender and county, and provide recurring annual updates to this database. This database will be  constructed by linking from tax returns, the decennial Census, and Social Security death records. Aim 2 will  characterize the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality rates by race and income in 2020-  21. This analysis will measure the quantity of excess deaths and disparities in their distribution caused by the  pandemic, and identify economic and health mechanisms generating those disparities. Aim 3 will measure the  long-term effects of post-pandemic changes in health, health behaviors, labor income, tax and transfer policies,  and behaviors on racial and socioeconomic inequality in mortality. This broader set of analyses will use the  substantial disruptions generated by the pandemic to examine how and why disparities are growing or shrinking  over time. Taken together, this project will contribute to research and policy work by providing critical new data  on the relationship between socioeconomic status and health, thereby providing a tool to monitor progress in  mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in underserved communities.",10,"10a, 10c"
C15854,Cardiorespiratory telerehabilitation for patients after hospitalization for COVID-19 in Brazil: randomized clinical trial,"Introduction: Although there is a lack of studies with specificities regarding post-COVID 19 clinical condition, patients who survive the acute condition are likely to suffer with post intensive care syndrome. Hence, they may experience respiratory, motor and psychological impairments, which should be addressed by long-term rehabilitation programs (RP). These programs aim to increase the chances of recovering from this syndrome. However, the offer to RP is worrying nationally and internationally, since, even in non-pandemic periods, there is an important deficit in the number of rehabilitation center opportunities. Considering the increase in the need of rehabilitation after COVID-19, there may happen a collapse in RP system. Moreover, there is a lack of consensus regarding the time after symptoms disappearance patients are still contagious, thereafter, distance RP (telerehabilitation) presents as an adequate tool, however, it must be tested before its implementation. Objectives: Study 1: to characterize physiological responses during the execution of activity daily life (ADL) in patients post-hospitalization for COVID-19. Study 2: to verify the effectiveness of cardiorespiratory telerehabilitation protocol in patients after COVID-related hospitalization. Methods: Individuals after COVID-19 related hospitalization will be assessed regarding eligibility criteria. For sample size will be executed a pilot study. Study 1 will be a longitudinal observational study and study 2 will be a randomized controlled trial coordinated by the Physiotherapy Department of the Federal University of São Carlos regarding a virtual domiciliary RP involving accessible and functional activities. The primary outcome will be functional capacity verified by physical tests. Expected results: we expect with study 1 to understand post-COVID-19 patient's PADL through an analysis of physiological variables after hospitalization and, with study 2 we expect to find and effective and accessible virtual RP with individualized prescription, thus increasing the access to PR benefits such as improvements in functional capacity and quality of life of patients after COVID-19 infection.",4,"4c, 4d, 4e"

C00828,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids,"Abstract: ""Organoids are three dimensional tissues derived from stem cells. The usage of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) enables the differentiation into organoids with human tissue-like features. iPSC can also be used to differentiate human lung organoids (HLO). The organization of HLOs is similar to the native lung, e.g. these organoids contain upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells, immature ciliated cells, smooth muscle, myofibroblasts as well as alveolar-like cell types. Thus, HLOs offer an excellent model to study human lung diseases like COVID-19. Moreover, the iPS derived organoids overcome several of the limitations of currently used biopsy lung derived models (availability of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2), inter biopsy variance).Within this proposal we aim to elaborate basics for the establishment of a high-throughput approach (differentiate HLOs with low variance). HLOs will be characterized using cryo-sectioning and immunofluorescence analysis upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to study viral replication kinetics and host responses. We recently contributed to the establishment of the first reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-2 offering the flexibility of using reporter viruses for a screening approach. Finally, we will test our system upon treatment with established antiviral compounds and aim to set up screening approaches to test antiviral compound libraries. Our approach offers a state-of-the-art model to study SARS-CoV-2 derived pathology and paves the way for the identification of effective antiviral drugs at high throughput level.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable",4,4b

For this research project, we will:   1. Estimate at the population level the short- and long- term impacts of the pandemic on site-specific adult cancer care trajectories using Quebec administrative health databases. We will use medical claims, hospital records, and death registry data for approximately 1,000,000 cancer patients diagnosed between 2010-2026 to assess the impact of the pandemic on cancer incidence, treatment pathways, and cancer survival in adults.   2. Expand a decision model of cancer epidemiology in Canada to include data on cancer incidence and mortality by socioeconomic status and ethnic identity. We will use this model to predict the long-term impacts of the pandemic on cancer health inequalities in Canada.   3. Update our review of Canadian cancer-related clinical practice guidelines to include pandemic recovery efforts across the cancer care system. Previously, we found that the cancer care system had quickly responded to the first pandemic wave by publishing guidelines for cancer treatment and prioritization during the pandemic. For this update, we will specially focus on how the healthcare system has implemented recovery efforts across the cancer care spectrum, including resumption of cancer screening and preventive services.   Our research will provide quick evidence needed to inform cancer care recovery efforts in Canada, and assess whether directives put in place to protect cancer care delivery during the pandemic have been effective at mitigating long-term negative impacts on cancer outcomes.","10, 11","10a, 11a"

C00387,AMRSim: A Microbial Reality Simulator,"Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are an established and growing issue in small animal veterinary practice in the developed world. The problem is, people can't see the bacteria on them, on animals, or on the surfaces and objects they touch. This makes it difficult to prevent and control infection in the most effective manner, as habits and standard practice are hard to change if you don't know what you are dealing with. While data exist to inform best practise in infection control, they are usually published in academic journals, thus having limited impact on what is done in practise.    Our solution is to make the 'invisible, visible' by building a three-dimensional graphical simulator of the interior of a veterinary practice in which humans, animals, and bacteria interact, according to rules observed from real-life. We are calling this simulator, AMRSim - A Microbial Reality Simulator.    The indoor environment of the vet practice can be viewed as a complex 'ecosystem' in which animals and humans interact with one another and their physical environment. Within this ecosystem there is a third, unseen group of actors - microbial agents - some of which have the capability to cause infectious disease in animals and/or humans. In the case of bacteria, they often persist in the environment on surfaces as a community. It is within these bacterial communities that they are more resistant to physical or chemical removal and are able to exchange mobile genetic elements that confer resistance to antibiotics. For this reason, activities such as disinfecting surfaces, sterilising instruments and treating patients with antibiotics, are a fundamental part of the working life of health professionals.    AMRSim will take data from the real world and make them 'come alive' in a visual way. Actual video footage will be used of the movements of humans and animals within a busy vet practice and the procedures undertaken, including those intended to reduce infection. The bacteria within the simulation will be introduced according to what is known of bacterial infection (types, location, antibiotic resistance) within vet practices from data already avaliable. Importantly, AMRSim will allow these normally invisible bacteria to be 'seen' as they multiply and spread through the indoor environment on people, animals and surfaces. By 'seeing' the interactions of animals, humans, and bacteria within space and time it will be possible to improve efforts to prevent bacteria entering and spreading through the physical environment, and improve their removal when they do.    AMRSim will be brought, at progressive stages of its development, to a series of co-design workshops with end-users to ensure it is made meaningful, appropriate and usable, and addresses key learning outcomes with respect to preventing and controlling infection.    The theory we shall test is that as practitioners interact with AMRSim, both in its development and then in its application, they will gain a greater appreciation for: 1) the impact their behaviours and activities can have on infection; 2) where weaknesses lie in current practise; and 3) where changes made to the way people and animals interact with each other and their environment can disrupt the status quo. These will lead to a reduced risk of bacterial contamination and infection, and ultimately reduced reliance on antibiotics.    Our previous work in the human health environment has shown the power of 'making the invisible, visible' by simulating infection control on a hospital ward using a visual simulator. We shall build on this experience with a new, multidisciplinary team with expertise in digital design, spatial design, co-design, environmental psychology, veterinary practice, and microbiology. It is our intention that the experience we gain in developing and using AMRSim will be applied more widely, such as for teaching students and to simulate other indoor environments where biosecurity is paramount.",5,5d

C03956,Structural and functional analysis of the coronavirus spike protein fusion peptide,"Project Summary / AbstractEnveloped viruses access their host cells by binding to receptors on the plasma membrane and then undergoingfusion with the host membrane. Both binding and fusion are mediated by a specific viral ""spike"" protein that istypically primed for fusion activation by proteolytic cleavage to expose the fusion peptide. Coronavirus fusionspike protein (CoV S) is a complex biomolecular machine that has a novel fusion peptide with has a great dealof inherent flexibility in its fusion reaction. This is exploited by these viruses in their diverse entry pathways andis a primary determinant of viral tropism. We have pioneered the concept that that the proteolytic cleavage eventsin S that lead to membrane fusion occur both at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains(called S1/S2), as well as adjacent to a structurally and functionally novel fusion peptide within S2 (called S2').Thus, there are notable differences between CoV S and most other class I fusion proteins including: 1) that theproteolytic events liberating the fusion peptide are diverse, and 2) that the fusion peptide itself is atypical insequence compared to other fusion peptides, containing a mixture of important hydrophobic and negatively-charged residues, and may represent a larger than normal fusion ""platform"" instead of a defined ""peptide"". Thusfusion peptide activity is likely controlled by reorganization of the fusion platform, based on both hydrophobic(i.e. lipid-binding) and ionic (i.e. Ca2+) interactions. Despite the recent availability of S structures in their pre-fusion state, there remains a very limited mechanistic understanding of membrane fusion for the CoV family, orany structural information to correlate structural biology aspects of S to its function in membrane fusion. Thisinformation is critical to understanding viral pathogenesis and CoV emergence into the human population. Wepropose an integrated biophysical, biochemical, and in vivo approach to study the unique cleavage-activatedregulation of CoV S protein, using Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as primary models. We will use state-of-the-art spectroscopyand an innovative single particle tracking technique to study S protein fusion peptide function, and combine thesewith in vivo infectivity studies, including at BSL3, will allow a complete picture of CoV fusion activation. Theseapproaches will reveal how structure and function vary depending on the key activators of S; i.e. receptor binding,protease availability and the local ionic environment. These studies will allow us to determine common principalsthat can be applied to all CoVs, moving the field forward with these innovative studies will provide criticalknowledge about CoV entry and tropism needed to safeguard human health from an emerging pathogen likelyto cause severe outbreaks, and for which few or no medical countermeasures exist.",1,1b
C09527,Development of lung T cell responses in infant respiratory immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARYThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes aspectrum of disease symptoms ranging from asymptomatic and mild/self-limited disease, to severe diseaseassociated with significant lung damage and high levels of morbidity and mortality. As all individuals areimmunologically naïve to this virus and there are currently no targeted treatments or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, protection and recovery depend on our own immune responses and supportive clinical care. Initially,children experienced largely asymptomatic or mild disease with severe disease resulting in significant lunginjury a rare occurrence. However, a new multisystem inflammatory disorder in children (MIS-C) related toSARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a late complication of infection. Children with MIS-C commonly present withcardiac dysfunction and shock, most closely resembling Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.Importantly, some children presenting with MIS-C have been reported to develop coronary artery aneurysms, afinding common to Kawasaki disease. The significant amount of mild/self-limited disease in children contrastedwith the excessive inflammation associated with SARS-CoV-2 suggests distinct immune responses.Additionally, the long-term implications, particularly to the cardiovascular system, of early life infection withSARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. We hypothesize that these distinct clinical manifestations in children, includinglack of symptomatic respiratory infection to SARS-Cov-2 is due to a robust and enhanced T cell response. Theaims of this proposal are to 1) Establish pediatric patient cohorts for comparing outcomes and immuneresponses across the spectrum of pediatric COVID-19 disease, 2) Define the pediatric immune response toSARS-CoV-2 and how it differs across the clinical spectrum of disease, and 3) Define the incidence of andpatient characteristics associated with sustained adverse cardiac outcomes for children with MIS-C andpediatric COVID-19. This project proposes to provide new insights into the pediatric immune and long-termcomplications of SARS-CoV-2 infection by employing a multi-disciplinary approach utilizing a team ofinvestigators including immunologists, pediatricians, and pediatric subspecialists (cardiology/critical caremedicine). These studies will provide invaluable insight that will help guide future decision making for treatmentand preventative strategies for children.","1, 4","1d, 4b"
C15106,The origin and future protective activity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific neutralizing antibodies,"PROJECT SUMMARY  SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 138 million people and resulted in over 2.8 million deaths so far, with the  expectation the pandemic will continue for many more months, and the virus will persist endemically for years,  exacerbated by emerging variants of concern (VoC). Although several vaccines are being used wide-spread, it  is unclear if they will be able to induce effective long-term immunity against emerging VoC. Highly effective anti-  viral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive, although several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the  Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein have been granted EUA for mild to moderate infection,  their effectiveness against severe disease has not yet been evident. With the slow pace of global vaccination,  limited anti-viral use/efficacy, and the emergence of antigenic drift variants, the trajectory of this pandemic and  future resurgences of the virus is of great concern. Fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of inducing  and sustaining protective humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical to its mitigation. The virus is now  classified into several clades, numerous VoC emerging, and indications including our work and others that some  of this antigenic drift is the result of the virus escaping from immune pressure and increased transmissibility. Drift  within the RBD is of the utmost concern as it can enhance the infectivity of the virus and negate the activity of  NAbs that may have developed from previous vaccination or infection. Numerous reports have emerged of  repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients, and breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals,  highlighting the imperfection of naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Utilizing our rationally designed  RBD/RBD-ACE2 fusion protein variants, we have identified epitopic and phenotypic heterogeneity amongst  RBD-specific human B cells and have isolated several potent RBD-specific human neutralizing monoclonal Abs  (NmAbs) (IC50<50 ng/ml) against SARS-CoV-2 which are entering into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial using inhaled  delivery in the coming months. We hypothesize that within RBD, the highly conserved regions (RBD-CR),  epitopes desirable for mediating broad and potent humoral protection, are surrounded by variable regions (RBD-  VR) that are structurally dynamic and highly susceptible to antigenic drift. Further, we hypothesize that RBD-VR  mitigate the development of potent and broad RBD-CR specific humoral responses through their  immunodominance and direct occlusion of RBD-CR. This RBD-CR/RBD-VR evolutionary dynamic is likely to  regulate the sustained protection (or failure) of humoral responses against future viral variants. We will 1) define  the ontological and phenotypic diversity of the human RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response, 2) define the  dynamics of maintenance of ACE2 binding and immunological pressure on constraining RBD evolution, and 3)  determine RBD Ab tolerance for and contribution to SARS-CoV-2 drift. Defining the limits of natural infection and  vaccination induced RBD neutralizing antibodies to drive antigenic drift and confer protection from divergent  SARS-CoV-2 viruses will inform the development next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics.","1, 6, 7","1d, 6a, 7a"

We will assess the  epidemiology and natural history of pediatric respiratory and enteric viral diseases and assess  transmission dynamics for vx-preventable (RV, Flu) and potentially vx-preventable pathogens,  such as norovirus (NV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. After obtaining  informed consent and assent, if applicable, in English or Spanish, we will interview families to  collect epidemiological and clinical information, vaccine history, and obtain study specimens  including respiratory and/or stool specimens, depending on clinical symptoms. Vaccination data  are recorded in our state vaccine database, which is very reliable and complete. During times of  COVID-19, novel methods of enrollment and capturing data may be utilized as per IRB-  approved protocols including verbal or online consent, telephone interviews to complete data  capture, and home specimen collection.

C06716,Unifying big data analyses for Sars-CoV-2 Research,"Summary: The COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a once in a generation, ""all-hands-on-deck"" event for thescientific community. This pandemic is also the first in which real time genomic data are available,e.g. via GISAID [1], where genomic sequences are deposited daily. Vital insights about the virus andthe epidemic depend on rapid and reliable genomic analysis of diverse viral sample sequences bymultiple laboratories. Yet we repeatedly encounter the same avoidable shortcomings early in viralinvestigations, including COVID-19: lack of reproducibility, rigor, and data/analytic sharing. Onlyabout 10% of the published genomes have quality metrics, primary data (read files), or any level ofdetails on analytics, making these data irreproducible and unverifiable; over 40% of GISAIDsubmissions to date provide no information about how the sequences were generated. Essentialquestions about the extent of intra-host genomic variability (indicative of adaptation or multipleinfection), viral evolution (selection, recombination), transmission (phylogenetic andphylogeographic) cannot be answered reliably if researchers cannot trust/replicate the source dataand analytical approaches. One of the key goals/deliverables of this supplement will be the openanalytic workflows that can be used to curate and standardize genomic data, and high qualityannotated variation data.",1,1c

C06182,Work-related stress: the Impact of COVID-19 on Critical Care and Redeployed Nurses,"Background: Critical care nurses (CCNs) and nurses deployed to critical care areas experienced significant challenges during the pandemic. They were faced with a multitude of difficult and new demands, including the high acuity and associated mortality rate of COVID-19 patients, the need to deliver care using personal protective equipment, to communicate and support relatives at a distance, and the well-publicised potential risks to personal and family health. There is a need to understand the impact of these increased demands at the individual, unit and organisational levels in order to know how best to support staff now and through possible second and third waves of the pandemic.     This 2-phase, mixed methods study will use a theoretical model of occupational stress, the Job Demand Resource (JD-R) model to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCNs and staff deployed to critical care areas. The JD-R model specifies individual factors (personal resources e.g. resilience), work environment and job characteristics (job demands (e.g. workload) and job resource (e.g. autonomy)) variables that may lead to either negative (health impairment, reduced job satisfaction, burnout) or positive (work engagement, commitment) outcomes for staff, and organisational outcomes (intention to remain and quality of care).     Phase 1: Questionnaire study: All CCNs employed within NHS ICUs in 20 adult critical care units across Scotland and three units in England (around n=2000) and registered nurses who were redeployed to critical care areas on at least 2 occasions will be invited to complete a questionnaire designed to measure all components of the JD-R model of stress. We have a recently completed study that employed the JD-R model to assess stress in CNNs prior to COVID. This study will act as baseline data for the current study. Structural equation modelling analyses will be used to assess the ability of the JD-R model to account for the data. These analyses will identify the sources of stress that impact on individual wellbeing and organisational outcomes, such as intention to remain in post. It will also identify factors that mitigate the impact of stress on individual and organisational outcomes.     Phase 2: Qualitative Interviews: in depth interviews with CNNs and redeployed nurses (up to 35 interviews with a stopping criterion) will explore the challenges and consequences of delivering critical care services during the pandemic and information about the support services they were offered, used and found useful will be recorded. Framework analyses will be applied to the data with the JD-R model providing the initial codes for charting. Interview text that remains after extraction of the JD-R coded text will be analysed using the usual framework method.     The use of the same theoretical framework for the quantitative and qualitative components of the study will facilitate integration of results across phase 1 and 2 of the study. Information about the support services offered, used and found useful by staff will be compared to the sources of stress and the factors that mediate or moderate the effect of stress on health and wellbeing identified in phase 1. Understanding the match and/or mis-match between stressors and support services provided will identify services to be retained, services that are candidates for discontinuance and areas of unmet need.","10, 11","10a, 11f"
C19395,Framing inequalities through causal stories: a cross-case comparison and critical reflection,"Despite being a central focus in research, policy, and practice in recent years, health inequalities have widened and are being further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The reasons are multiple and complex, but there is increasing concern that the framing of health inequalities may be contributing to implementation challenges. This is important because while the health sector is not alone in grappling with socially-driven inequalities in outcomes, there is a persistent desire to embed a 'health inequalities' perspective across all sectors and policies. The aim of this research is to employ theoretical and methodological tools from framing analysis to explore, compare, and critically reflect upon different ways in which inequalities in outcomes are framed across multiple sectors beyond health. These sectors include early years education, youth justice, and housing, and, for each, data will be collected through documentary analysis of academic literature and policy reports; semi-structured interviews with actors working to reduce inequalities; and group 'framing reflection' exercises. The research will produce novel comparative analyses, and interdisciplinary reflections, on contrasting ways of framing inequalities. These findings will illuminate the potential for more cross-sectoral accounts of inequalities that would lead to greater collective understanding and action on the cross-cutting underlying causes.",10,"10a, 10b"

C10656,Traumatic stress and  Mental Health Impacts  of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Front-Line Workers in Homeless Services,"Lay Abstract: This proposal addresses the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline workers in the homeless sector. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, our research reported high levels of direct traumatic stress among frontline workers. In five previous studies, we surveyed frontline workers in homeless services, in Calgary, Edmonton, AB, and Saint John, NB. Results showed consistently high rates of traumatic stress across all locations, exacerbated by lack of training, inadequate preparation for responses in a pandemic and a perceived lack of physical and psychological safety that could potentiate further primary traumatic stress.  Given the sudden and protracted impact of the COVID-19 virus and the systemic challenges faced in the social services, it is critical to examine how these experiences are impacting frontline workers' mental health and well-being. The overall goal of this research is to document the extent to which the COVID-19 crisis has impacted psychological well-being and work-related disability among frontline workers in the homeless sector. A second aim is to document rates of disability (stress) leave for staff through Workers' Compensation Board claims to further asses the extent of this impact. Finally, we will extend the study to four other Canadian cities.  Together this data will present important information on staff stress, the impact of the COVID-19 virus, resultant disabilities, and possible mitigating factors resulting from organizational changes. Thus, this study would provide understanding of the pandemic's impact on this vital workforce and illuminate any organizational actions that informed mitigating strategies for staff well-being. This is especially critical as health authorities predict a second and possible third wave of infections that would seriously deplete an already highly stressed group of essential workers.","10, 11","10a, 11f"
C06114,CoV-2 specific serological diagnostics based on epitopes (EpiCoV2020),"The challenge for immune diagnostics dealing with Corona viruses like SARS-CoV-2 is the high background of infections with many different types from this subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. This project aims at rapidly identifying individual peptide epitopes, both specific and unspecific, and mimotopes with improved affinities for serum antibodies from different patients. We are using resources readily set up for projects similar by the immunological and diagnostic challenge as well as readily available sera from a clinical partner.    The project's goal is not only to identify a pool of such epitope/mimotope sequences with a proprietary statistical phage display method, NGS and a specially developed software, but also to rapidly validate them in arrays and in a second step in simple PoC devices to identify those suitable for diagnostic tools. They will differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other Corona virus infections, even if the antibody titers are decreasing after the infection. Peptide diagnostics can be reproducibly produced by any peptide manufacturer around the globe. This would contribute to worldwide standards in COVID-19 diagnosis and identification of persons with acquired immunity against the virus.     In a more advanced setting differential epitope diagnostics will allow to correlate B-cell response with disease progression in a heterogenous background of recent Corona infections.

All participants receive repeated state-of-the-art neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing,bioassays, and detailed youth and parent assessments of substance use, mental health, physical health, andculture and environment.In March 2020, when our participants are ages 11-13, the world became substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an upheaval in the economy and the lives of almost every family. The majority of U.S.schools closed to reduce viral spread. Many parents incurred changes in work (from home, longer shifts,reduced wages, and/or job loss), some services and support systems became disrupted, and case counts anddeath tolls surge. The massive multifaceted impact of this unprecedented event has the potential to affect fordecades those who are currently children. The proposed research immediately leverages the ABCD cohort,infrastructure, and existing protocol to rapidly characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on eachchild in the study. By collecting this situational information as soon as possible, we can use existing ABCD datato examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, cognition, substance use,academic achievement, social functioning, and physical and mental health.The proposed project would query all ABCD participants and their parents multiple times about the impact ofthe pandemic on their lives and, in a subset of participants, examine their physical activity and sleep objectivelywith activity trackers (Fitbits), over the months of school closures, job loss, and disease spread. This will allowthe consortium and scientific community at large to test multiple aims regarding how various facets of thepandemic affect development. This includes: (1) characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on brainand cognitive development and onset of substance use; (2) evaluating the extent to which alternative schoolingapproaches exacerbate or mitigate the impact of the pandemic on brain and cognitive development andsubstance use outcomes; and (3) evaluating the extent to which family stressors exacerbate or mitigate theimpact of the pandemic on neurobiological, cognitive, and substance use outcomes.

C00868,Supplement: Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimics,"Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimicsThis supplement request explores the possibility that sialoglycans may be co-receptors for SARS and COVID-19 virus spike (S) proteins, as is the case with MERS and other Coronaviruses (CoVs). Numerous virusesrecognize host cell surface glycans that terminate in sialic acids (Sias), a family of 9-carbon-backbonemonosaccharides present at very high densities on all vertebrate cell surfaces, and on most secreted proteins--particularly mucins that line and protect mucosal surfaces like the airways. Viral recognition of host sialoglycansis affected by Sia type, linkage to, and the structure of underlying glycans. Much of this natural diversity of Siasin viral infection remains underexplored. While many respiratory disease-causing viruses target Sias, Siarecognition is not currently reported in SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic virus. This stands in contrast tothe extensive literature on Coronaviruses and Sia receptors and is likely because a definitive human proteinreceptor (ACE2) for the virus S protein has been identified. A similar situation existed for the earlier MERS-CoVwhich had a well-defined receptor (DPP4) but was later found to also bind Sias via a different binding site. Giventhe very high Sia density in vivo, and the fact that Sias are the first contact of a virus on a mucosal surface, Siadiversity is likely to play important roles during natural infections. We hypothesize that airway Sias are alsorecognized by S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. This supplement is based on strong foundationsbuilt by decades of studies of Sia diversity by the collaborating labs, including the parent project which addressesinstability of Sia O-acetyl modifications by synthesizing sialosides with corresponding N-acetyl analogs. Theurgent need for more careful exploration of Sia-binding functions of SARS and MERS will utilize a uniquesialoglycan microarray built up over years of collaboration between the labs. Additional diversity of humansialosides such as those with 9-O-lactyl Sia that have heretofore not been studied, but could be critical, will alsobe explored. We propose sialoglycan microarray studies of recombinant soluble external domains of S proteinsof MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with human CoVs causing milder diseases, todetect Sia-dependent binding that has been missed so far. We will synthesize sialosides containing naturallyoccurring 9-O-lactyl-Sia and more stable 9-N-lactyl analogs and integrate these with the microarray and bindingstudies. Computational studies, including molecular dynamics simulation of binding free energies, willcomplement the array studies by predicting Sia variants that might bind, and modelling binding seen in arraystudies. These studies will generate new knowledge that may help to better understand viral infection,pathogenesis, and transmission from animals to humans and among humans. Additional viral epitopes criticalfor binding neutralization may be identified that could suggest novel preventative and/or therapeutic approachesto COVID-19. This project is therefore well suited to the urgency of the current pandemic situation. Informationlearned can also be applied toward the prediction and prevention of future epidemics and pandemics.","1, 4","1b, 4b"

C17909,Theme 2 - the role of antibodies in Covid infection,"In their study, published in eLife (29 July), the scientists analysed blood samples collected from patients who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who were admitted to UCLH for other reasons, samples from health care workers as well as samples collected from patients at different points earlier in the pandemic. They identified COVID-19 antibodies in the blood, and in the lab ran tests to see if antibodies produced after infection with one variant were able to bind to and neutralise other variants. ... ""As the antibodies were able to bind to other variants at a similar level, but had differing ability to neutralise other strains, this suggests that there are only a few regions on the spike of the virus which are important to this neutralisation process. It is the mutations within these key sites which impact the ability of antibodies produced by one variant to neutralise another."" - from Crick news article August 2021.",1,1d
C00287,The Spread of the Coronavirus in Germany: Socio-Economic Factors and Consequences,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in China in January and the respiratory disease it causes, COVID-19, have spread around the world within a matter of weeks. To prevent the medical and health system from becoming overwhelmed by patients in need of treatment, efforts are being made to slow the spread of the disease over as long a period as possible. Due to the expected increase in the number of new infections, further measures and guidelines can be expected in the coming weeks and months that will affect virtually all aspects of people's lives in Germany. Urgent questions arise as to the medical and health impacts of the virus; the social, psychological, economic, and political factors that affect its spread; and the consequences thereof-questions that cannot currently be investigated due to the lack of a generalizable database. The planned research project aims to investigate the acute, medium-term, and long-term socio-economic factors in and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus in Germany. Based on standardized telephone surveys of a representative sample of Germany's will focus on subjective experiences, on how informed the population is, on how people are handling the crisis at an individual level, and on identifying the individual and social factors that play a role in this crisis and the consequences thereof. The survey will cover the following topics: a) health behavior and health inequality, b) labor market and economic situations, c) social life, networks, and mobility, d) mental health and well-being, and e) social cohesion.","9, 10","9a, 10c"
P25386,IMPACT: Innovations using Mhealth for People with dementiA and Co-morbidiTies,"Background: Health systems in LMICs are poorly equipped to care for chronic mental and physical disease, which are rapidly increasing with aging populations. Cognitive impairment challenges health systems on multiple fronts, incurring huge human and financial costs. Latin America has the highest projected increase in dementia incidence globally, and in Peru there are ~300,000 people with dementia (PWD). Many are undiagnosed and lack basic support. Care is often provided exclusively by family members. PWD have twice as many co-morbidities as those without dementia which, despite being treatable, are often missed, poorly managed and reduce quality of life for PWD and their carers.    Aims and objectives: Project IMPACT will use dementia as a tracer condition to strengthen health systems in Latin America through sustainable, integrated, person-centred, community-delivered, technology-enabled innovation. Our specific objectives are to i) evaluate health systems readiness to provide support for PWD; ii) develop and implement an mHealth application for diagnosis of dementia by community health workers (CHWs) in Peru; iii) determine the feasibility of an mHealth-delivered, CHW-supported intervention to improve health-related quality of life for PWD and their carers; iv) assess the socioeconomic burden of dementia in Peru. Through these objectives, and in combination with our Outreach, Capacity Building and Engagement activities, we will identify barriers to and facilitators for high-quality health systems.    Methods: Our strongly interdisciplinary team includes researchers, policymakers and community representatives working together across 5 interrelated work packages (WPs). WP1 (Health System Readiness) will assess the needs of PWD and their carers and the readiness of the Peruvian health system to meet those needs. The tools developed will also be applied in 3 other Latin American countries. WP2 (Diagnosis) will co-produce an mHealth app for CHWs to find cases of dementia and record co-morbidities. We will evaluate the acceptability and accuracy of this app in 1600 PWD and controls from four distinct regions of Peru: the capital city (Lima), a coastal semi-urban region, the Andes mountains and the Amazon jungle. We will test integration of the app into primary health care. WP3 (Intervention) will adapt an existing mHealth intervention, developed in the US, to the Peruvian context. The intervention will include co-morbidity management help, motivation for physical exercise and group-based activities and carer support. Its implementation will be assessed in a feasibility study. WP4 (Health Economics) will estimate the economic burden and impact on quality of life of dementia and co-morbidities using questionnaires administered to the PWD and controls identified in WP2. WP5 will oversee all project management activities and engage stakeholders and the wider community to increase awareness and tackle sigma.    Anticipated impact and dissemination: We will work with patients, carers, health care workers, not-for-profit organisations, academics and policy makers to co-design our research and ensure maximum impact for PWD in Peru and beyond. We envisage: i) the diagnostic app being implemented nationwide within the health service; ii) preparing for a full trial of the complex intervention; iii) informing the design of a National Dementia Plan in Peru; iv) adaptation and application of health system readiness tools in other Latin American countries.","10, 11","10a, 11a"
C03929,Impact of Vitamin D on the Chemopreventive Efficacy of Erlotinib against Oral Cancer,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has changed the practice of medicine in a fundamental manner resulting in sweeping changes in healthcare virtually across all medical specialties. Dentistry, in particular, has been dramatically affected by this pandemic, given the close 'person-to-person' contact involved in delivering dental care and treatment procedures that produce aerosols and often result in the dental health care professional (DHCP) contact/exposure to blood, saliva and respiratory droplets. Specifically, the pandemic has led to adaptations to diagnostic and treatment paradigms, modifications to clinical workflow and dental/oral care delivery models. Given that the pandemic is still on-going, the magnitude of the impact of these modified oral health care delivery models, especially in high-risk patient populations (e.g. cancer patients) is not known. This application for a ""Urgent Competitive Revision to Existing NIH Grants (Urgent Supplement)"" is being submitted in response to PA-18-935 to request supplemental funding to the R01DE024595 (PI: Seshadri, Mukund).

C07225,Juntos (Together): A community led approach to enhance to Covid-19 testing among vulnerable Latinos,"PROJECT SUMMARY Latinos are among the most heavily impacted communities by the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, with more than 3 times higher rate than non-Hispanic whites. To address this disparity, this team of investigators andcommunity partners has established a multi-pronged approach that leverages the skill set of trusted bilingual/bicultural peer navigators (or promotoras) to address social determinants of health (SDOH) that create barriers to testing (such as lack of insurance, immigration status, stigmatization or loss of job/income), and to expand access to free COVID-19 testing in community settings.     Our preliminary findings show that leveraging the promotora model for timely delivery of results (within 48 hours), paired with rapid linkage of COVID-19 positive patients to critical services (including clinical follow-up, food delivery, cash assistance, and/or isolation hotel), and referral of contacts for testing, increased acceptability and uptake of COVID-19 testing in a heavily impacted Latino community.     The overall goal of this Phase I Testing Research Project called Juntos (Together) is to work closely with our community partners to systematically evaluate and refine current COVID-19 testing strategies, and to implement and evaluate innovative customized strategies to rapidly increase reach, access, acceptance, uptake, and sustainment of FDA-authorized/approved diagnostics (especially viral tests) for this highly vulnerable and health care marginalized community.     Leveraging community partnerships and prior experience implementing an HIV testing campaign, we will develop and evaluate a customized Juntos COVID-19 testing campaign to address specific common concerns in the Latino community and link users to existing Johns Hopkins COVID-19 community testing sites and to new options, including home-based and/or self-testing kits and rapid tests (Aim 1).     To assess the overall impact of the Juntos COVID-19 Testing Project, we will rely on the latest in causal inference methods for evaluating population-level health interventions and implement a synthetic control analysis to compare testing uptake and positivity rate among Latinos in Baltimore City (intervention site) as compared to control zip codes across Maryland. (Aim 2).     Finally, informed by Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM framework, we will assess the implementation determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes of existing and novel Juntos testing interventions to inform future broad-scale implementation (Aim 3).     We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team withmethodological expertise in implementation science, community-based research, and laboratory medicine, andhave a mature and long-standing collaboration with our partners at Esperanza Center, Casa de Maryland, theMayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs, and religious leaders. Our team is enthusiastic to propose this implementation study to enhance access to testing for the Latino community, and will actively coordinate and share data and protocols with other grantees, the CDCC, and other research supported by the RADx-UP program.","3, 4, 8, 9","3c, 4c, 8d, 9a, 9b, 9c"
C09520,Nanobody-Based Electrochemical Biosensor for Real-Time Detection of Aerosolized SARS-CoV2,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted 6.2 million Americans and killed 190,000 as of early September2020 (WHO website); a roughly 3% mortality. Between a shortage in testing and unidentified asymptomaticindividuals, the actual number of those infected could be 6 to 24-fold higher than that reported. SARS-CoV-2(CoV-2), the virus underlying the disease, results in a range of symptoms; in select cases a severe respiratoryillness that impedes breathing that could lead to hospitalization and death. CoV-2 is transmitted person-to-person via inhalation of the virus through mucosal membranes of the nose and throat from transfer aftertouching a contaminated surface or by inhaling aerosolized virus. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is likely to beprevalent well into 2021 and beyond. We must increase our ability to test for CoV-2. First, testing is needed to diagnose individuals that aresymptomatic or asymptomatic to reduce community spread. And second, monitoring gathering areas forairborne virus that could inform the decision to shutdown a space or implement disinfection and mitigation ofan area. We propose to use an electrochemical biosensor in two detection devices, 1) a diagnosticbreathalyzer for instant detection of CoV-2 and 2) an airborne detector for real-time, continuous surveillance ofa large space. We have developed a novel ultra-sensitive, antibody-based electrochemical biosensor to detect CoV-2repeat binding domain (RBD) spike protein. The technology is based on a micro-immunoelectrode (MIE)biosensor pioneered by the Cirrito laboratory to study protein dynamics in the setting of neurodegeneration (2,3).The biosensor uses voltammetry to measure the oxidation of tyrosine amino acids; oxidation is the release ofelectrons that the biosensor measures as a change in current. Antibodies are covalently attached to theelectrode surface to provide selectivity. Our prototype CoV-2 biosensor is sensitive to 2 femtogram/ml,compared to several current CoV-2 antigen tests that are sensitive to the low picogram/ml range. The proposal will first (Aim 1) optimize our CoV-2 biosensor to detect CoV-2 viral particles, as well as testseveral parameters to increase sensitivity and longevity. Aim 2 will build a test breathalyzer that will utilize anebulizer to generate virus laden air containing aerosol droplets similar to a breath that contain definedconcentrations of CoV-2 viral particles. Aim 3 will test the airborne biosensor in a realistic environment. Co-IChakrabarty's laboratory has unique capabilities of mimicking real-world environmental conditions, especiallyin the context of atmospheric aerosols, necessary for testing and optimizing the biosensor's performance forfield deployment. Atmospheric conditions include relative humidity (RH) and temperature, as well as commonairborne pollutants found indoors. Finding novel means to detect the CoV-2, as well as create a platform to detect other and futurepathogens, would enable us to limit the viral spread throughout the community in the current and futurepandemics.","1, 5","1a, 5b"
P21470,Furopyrimidines as novel inhibitors of henipaviruses,"The emergence and reemergence of pathogenic viruses represent continuous infectious disease threats  to public health. Among these, the paramyxoviruses, which include many important human and animal  pathogens, also include two excellent examples of emerged, zoonotic viral pathogens of importance: the  henipaviruses; Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV). HeV and NiV have a uniquely broad host  tropism capable of infecting at least 18 animal species across 6 orders of mammals. HeV and NiV can  also cause a systemic and often fatal respiratory and/or neurological disease in 11 mammalian species  including humans. These henipaviruses remain significant biothreats to humans and economically  important livestock in Australia and throughout South East Asia. In addition, there are no vaccines or  antivirals approved for human use. Thus new treatment options are urgently needed. This application  defines a plan to develop potent, small molecule inhibitors, which inhibit henipavirus replication. We have  identified compounds that inhibit replication of these viruses, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range.  In this application, we propose three specific aims: (1) To optimize the lead (and backup) scaffold and  select developmental candidates; (2) Develop the SAR in the henipavirus infectious assay and further  investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of the replication inhibitors; and (3) Select henipavirus  inhibitors with in vitro ADME properties suitable for whole animal testing in an infectious animal model.",6,6a

C10731,The Effect of COVID-19 Policies on Road Traffic Injury Among Vulnerable Road Users in Canadian Cities,"An unexpected benefit of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a temporary, dramatic reduction in road traffic injuries. Pandemic-related stay-at-home and physical distancing policies led to great reductions in police-reported collisions during the early stages of the pandemic. However, with the progression of the stages of re-opening, reports of collision fatalities have been emerging, likely due to reported increases in speeding.  We will assemble collision data from March 2017-April 2023 in 4 Canadian cities - Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver and across provinces. The objectives are to 1)determine the effects of the implementation of COVID-19 'stay home' and physical distancing policies on rates of road traffic deaths and injuries 2) determine the effects of relaxation of COVID-19 'stay home' policies (while maintaining physical distancing policies) on rates of road traffic deaths and injuries 3)determine the effects of specific COVID-19 related local roadway mitigation strategies on road traffic injuries and deaths (e.g. lane closures, new bicycle lanes). Collisions and specific new local road safety strategies, such as bike lanes and road closures will be mapped. Collision rates before the implementation of stay-at-home and physical distancing policies, during implementation, and after the relaxation of policies will be compared as well as before and after the implementation of specific road interventions. Data will be analyzed by age, sex, injury severity and travel mode.   Cities now have a critical opportunity to institute policies to create safer walking and cycling environments. This pan-Canadian team brings decades of experience having collaborated on applied interdisciplinary research related to active transportation, motor vehicle collisions, road safety policy and the built environment.

C15873,Development of VLPs-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other human Coronaviruses,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines must be one step ahead of the rapid evolution of the virus. Therefore immunogenic and flexible vaccine platforms are needed. Variants of concern (VOCs) that continually emerge with an unprecedented spread of the virus have already significantly increased the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 and affected the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines and vaccination worldwide, being no different in Brazil. Moreover, the recent pandemic is not the first and will not be the last one caused by zoonotic Coronaviruses in this century, as seen with SARS and MERS. Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) are a highly versatile and already consolidated vaccine platform against other viruses, such as HBC and HPV. And the recent approval and success of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 is also exciting since this technology is versatile and easily adaptable against new epidemiologic threats. This project will develop three VLPs-based vaccines: two composed of QB-VLPs associated with mRNA against SARS-CoV-2 and Pancoronavirus, respectively, and another homologous VLPs comprising the S, M, E, and N proteins from SARS-CoV-2. The use of novel vaccines that use mRNA associated with VLPs represents a promising way of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, new VOCs, and future Coronaviruses outbreaks.",7,7a
P21952,Evaluation of a PPMO Inhibitor of Lassa Virus Infection and Disease in a Guinea Pig Model,"Evaluation of a PPMO Inhibitor of Lassa Virus Infection and Disease in a Guinea Pig Model  ABSTRACT:  Lassa fever (LF) is caused by infection with Lassa virus (LASV), and is currently a major human disease problem  in much of West Africa, causing thousands of deaths annually. Recent outbreaks of LF have been characterized  by an increased number of cases and larger geographic footprint compared to previous outbreaks, and constitute  a burgeoning public health crisis. In addition, the number of LF cases imported into non-endemic countries is  growing, and there is also concern that LASV could be used as an agent of biological warfare. There is as yet  no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral therapeutic to intervene against LASV-infections and treat patients with  LF, and current treatment options have poor efficacy. There is therefore an immediate and critical medical need  for new antiviral compounds to address LASV. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers  (PPMO) are a class of single-stranded-nucleic acid analogs that can enter cells readily and interfere with the  production of viral proteins through steric blocking of complementary RNA. PPMO have shown considerable  antiviral efficacy in vitro and in vivo against a number of RNA viruses, including several arenaviruses. We  propose to synthesize two PPMO targeting highly conserved RNA sequences in the genomic termini of the LASV  genome. Each PPMO will be tested in a non-cytotoxic dose-range for antiviral activity against several genetically-  disparate strains of LASV. The PPMO exhibiting the highest antiviral efficacy in vitro will then be advanced to  testing in a guinea pig model of LASV disease. Animal weight, temperature, appearance and behavior, along  with mortality and viral titer in several tissues will be monitored. This study is designed to evaluate the ability of  PPMO to reduce morbidity and mortality in a small-animal model of of severe LASV-disease. If successful, the  project will produce an inhibitor that would be immediately useful as a research reagent against any strain of  LASV and as a candidate for further development as a therapeutic agent against LASV infections in humans.",6,6a

C01311,New Approaches to Bayesian Data Science: Tackling Challenges from the Health Sciences,"The health sciences have seen an explosion in the amount of data collected at both individual and population levels. This data can be varied, including genetic information, health records, data on activity levels obtained from wearable devices, and image data from scans. There is huge potential for improved diagnoses, timely interventions and more effective treatments if we can fully extract understanding from this data. Example applications included real-time monitoring of patients, developing personalised treatment, or real-time monitoring and decision-making for epidemics. However the data science challenges in extracting these insights are vast.    Features of these challenges include the need to make inferences about and decisions for individuals from within a population, and the need to synthesise information from disparate data sources and data types. Whilst we have substantial data collected at a population level, the amount of information on any given individual may be still be limited. Appropriately quantifying uncertainty is crucial for making decisions, with the optimal decision often being driven by the probability of relatively rare events (e.g. extreme reaction to a drug). We need model-based approaches to data science that can leverage scientific understanding, but we need the statistical analyses to be robust to unavoidable inadequacies of these models. Underpinning many of these applications is the requirement to develop new understanding, and this differs from a focus on making predictions that it is most common among current statistical or machine learning methods.     Bayesian data science provides  a natural framework for tackling these challenges. Bayesian methods are model-based, can appropriately quantify and propagate uncertainty, and through hierarchical models are able to use population-level information when making inferences about individuals. Repeated application of Bayes theorem gives a natural paradigm for synthesizing information across multiple data sources. However, current Bayesian data science methods are not feasible for many modern, big-data, applications in the health sciences. Bayesian methods require integrating over uncertainty. Such high-dimensional integration carries a substantial computational overhead when compared to alternative, often optimization-based, data science methods. So while the motivation for Bayesian analysis is clear, this computational overhead means that, currently, implementing Bayesian approaches is often not feasible.      This programme of research will develop the new approaches to Bayesian data science that are needed both within the health sciences and more widely. It builds on recent breakthroughs in Monte Carlo integration methods that show great promise for being efficient for large data; and on new paradigms for Bayesian-like updates that are suitable for complex models and which focus modelling effort just on the aspects of these models that are most important. It will address key research challenges in the health sciences -- directly developing new insights and understanding for these.",,
P23603,Preventing non-communicable diseases caused by the post-acute phase of cOvid-19 INfecTion,"The post-acute phase (PAP) of COVID-19, occurring 'â•4 months after the acute phase, is associated with an increased risk for the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The risk of complications in this phase does not depend on the severity of the acute phase. In the EU, more than 183 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported and up to 70% of patients suffer reduced organ function in the PAP. Our conservative estimate it that 5% of people who have suffered COVID-19 are at risk of developing NCDs of the pulmonary, cardiovascular and renal systems due to the PAP.    To avoid the significant socioeconomic costs related to this burden, POINT will develop knowledge-based biomarkers for prevention and management of NCDs, a virtual twin model that offers clinical decision support, and clinical guidelines and recommendations for the entire health care value chain with special attention to vulnerable groups. We will fulfil an unmet need for knowledge and tools to minimize the risk factors of the PAP at the optimal point in time, when healthcare systems will have to redirect their focus from the acute phase of COVID-19 to the post-acute phase. The outcomes of POINT will aid the health care value chain already from an early phase of the project. Furthermore, POINT will correlate and promote knowledge on the development of NCDs in general and the risks of PAP from other infectious diseases.    POINT will meet the challenges with a holistic approach from a truly interdisciplinary consortium consisting of clinical experts, molecular biologists, behavioural scientists, and computer scientists, who will take advantage of cohorts of more than 6 million Europeans, and cross-sectional biobanks from more than 6000 Europeans.

P25523,Investigating the molecular mechanisms of a novel group of small-molecule Bax inhibitors,"The mitochondria has always been known as the ;powerhouse of the cell. However, the association between neuronal health and mitochondrial function is something that is not widely known. When a neuronal cell encounters a stressor during a stroke (oxygen deprivation), brain injury (physical trauma) or epileptic seizure (electrical disturbance), a pore forms on the mitochondria which ultimately results in a signal cascade that leads to cell death. Therefore, the prognosis of patients is largely influenced by the magnitude of neuronal cell death following one of the aforementioned events.The David Andrews lab specializes in uncovering how a protein called Bax regulates mitochondrial dynamics during cell death. Recently, we uncovered several small molecules that inhibit Bax activation. Therefore for this proposal, we seek to understand the mechanism by which the small molecules suppress Bax-mediated cell death. First, we wish to characterize the binding site and affinity of the small molecule inhibitors to Bax. Second, we would like to uncover whether Bax activation is suppressed by the small molecules on the mitochondria or elsewhere in the cell. Third, we wish to study Bax dynamics and behaviour once it is suppressed by the small molecule inhibitors. Finally, we need to assess and quantify the extent to which the small molecule inhibitors prevent Bax-mediated cell death.Understanding how the small molecule inhibitors suppress Bax activation from a mechanistic point of view is predicted to facilitate future drug design aimed at ameliorating patient prognosis following a stroke, seizure, or brain injury. Thus, Bax is a promising druggable target with medicinal potential.",4,4b
P22674,Seasonal and universal Vaccination in aged populations with pre-existing immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Current influenza (flu) vaccination based on hypervariable hemagglutinin (HA) protein fails to provide  effective cross protection. The efficacy of vaccination is low in the aged populations even with pre-existing  immunity. The impacts of pre-existing immunity on the immunogenicity and efficacy of universal and seasonal  vaccination largely remain not well understood in the aged populations. Development of new flu vaccines and  vaccination strategies improving cross protective efficacy in young naÃƒÂ¯ve and aged hosts with pre-existing  immunity is of high priority. Mono conserved antigenic targets inducing cross protection tested in naÃƒÂ¯ve animal  models include the flu A virus M2 extracellular domain (M2e), HA-stalk domains, and neuraminidase (NA) were  reported but insufficient for translation to humans. The multi-target universal vaccines in naÃƒÂ¯ve and aged hosts  with pre-existing immunity remain to be developed.   We developed heterologous tandem repeat of M2e (5xM2e) presented on immunogenic virus-like  particles (5xM2e VLP). Vaccination with 5xM2e VLP was effective in broadening cross protection but  suboptimal. A further improved universal vaccine should be developed. Our preliminary studies found  synergistic effects on improving cross protection by both M2e and NA immunity. Therefore, as a new universal  vaccine candidate, we developed a multi NA + 5xM2e VLP vaccine containing multi-subtype NA and 5xM2e on  the same VLP particle. In addition, we newly designed genetically linked novel recombinant M2e-stalk  universal protein vaccines effectively inducing both M2e and HA-stalk immunity and conferring broad cross-  group protection. Adjuvanted universal vaccination will overcome the aging-related immune senescence by  activating T and B immune cells in naÃƒÂ¯ve hosts or aged populations under pre-existing immunity.   In this project, we will test the hypothesis that new universal vaccination inducing multi immunity (M2e,  Stalk, NA) will enhance the breadth and efficacy of cross protection in adult and aged populations with or  without pre-existing immunity. Under Aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of multi-target universal vaccines in  young adult mice and ferrets under naÃƒÂ¯ve and pre-existing immune conditions. In Aim 2 studies, we will  determine the durability of cross protective immunity by multi targeting new universal vaccines and test a  vaccination strategy enhancing cross protection in aged mouse and ferret animal models. In the Aim 3, we will  investigate cross protective immune mechanisms of multi targeting universal vaccination in young and aged  mouse models. The outcomes in this project will be highly significant in the aspect of translational science and  relevance to improve the cross protective efficacy of flu vaccination.",7,7a
C07330,Covid-19: Industry Level Origins of Fluctuations in Growth Rates and Economic Welfare,"The impact of the COVID-19 shock on the UK economy has been heterogeneous across sectors, suggestive of significant reallocation as the economy recovers. Government support for the economy will therefore need to be targeted at specific sectors in order to be effective. We can observe sector-level stock prices and dividends, and estimate wages, but cannot observe directly how expectations of their long-run growth rates and sector sizes have shifted in response   to the COVID-19 shock. However, using an asset pricing theory model (based on an extension of work by one of the applicants [Bhamra, Kuehn and Strebulaev (2011)] we can use sector-level stock prices   and dividends and wages to derive equations linking these variables to expected long- run growth rates of dividends and wages across sectors. We can hence estimate sector-level expected long-run growth rates and show how they have changed in response to the COVID-19 shock. We can also estimate the contribution of each sector to aggregate welfare in terms of labour income and consumption and   show how these contributions have changed over time. By basing our analysis on asset prices, we can update our estimates of sector-level growth rates In real time. This is important, because sector-level macroeconomic data often lags events (e.g., UK sector-level data on output for February 2020 was released by the ONS on 9th April 2020). Existing work has exploited asset prices to estimate aggregate growth rates for the US [see Gormsen & Koijen (2020)], but no such work exists at the sectoral level.",10,10c
P22735,Automated chemo-enzymatic synthesis of N-glycans for host-pathogen interactions,"SUMMARY  Numerous viruses initiate infection by binding to cell surface glycans of the host. The selectivities of viral  receptor binding proteins for specific glycans critically determine host range, tissue- and cell tropism  and pathogenesis. A detailed understanding of receptor usage by respiratory viruses is critical for the  development of surveillance, prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate risks of future pandemic  outbreaks. Glycan receptor usage by respiratory viruses have been difficult to probe because of a lack  of appropriate panels of glycans for structure-activity studies. The latter is due to limitations in synthetic  methodologies that do not permit the preparation of large panels of biological relevant glycans.  In this program, chemoenzymatic methodologies will be developed that make it possible to prepare a  wide range of N-glycan found in the respiratory tract of human and relevant animals. It is based on a  new synthetic paradigm, which we coined Ã¢Â€ÂœStop-and-Go-Chemoenzymatic GlycosylationÃ¢Â€Â. It uses  chemically modified sugar nucleotide donors that can be employed by relevant glycosyl transferases to  give products in which particular residues are temporarily blocked from further enzymatic modification.  At an appropriate stage of synthesis, the blocking group can be removed to give a natural glycan. The  speed of glycan synthesis will be increased by developing an automation platform that can perform  enzymatic and chemical manipulations. The new methodologies will be used to prepare a collection of  complex N-glycans that resemble structures expressed by respiratory tissue for host-pathogen studies.  In this application, the collection of glycans will used to examine in detail receptor usage of influenza A  viruses. The glycans will be printed as a microarray to probe binding specificities of human and animal  influenza A viruses. Selected compounds will be examined in dynamic binding assays to establish the  interplay between hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) activity. The proposed studies will  uncover unique traits of human and animal IAVs, which will facilitate the implementation of surveillance,  prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate risks of future pandemics. The result of the studies will  be exploited to develop an array-based system to antigenically characterize IAVs, which will greatly  facilitate strain selection for seasonal flu vaccination.  1","1, 4","1b, 4b"
C03920,Administrative Supplement Covid19: Molecular Regulation of B cells and T cells in Human SLE,"The COVID19 pandemic illustrates the urgent need for understanding human B cell responses to emergentpathogens and its application to assessing herd immunity. Our laboratories have described the phenotypic,immunological and molecular features of different arms of human B cell responses and in particular, the originalcharacterization of the human extrafollicular effector B cell activation pathway and its contribution to differentmemory and plasma cells responses. On that basis, we we propose to interrogate the different arms of the B cellresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 virus; to identify the B cell compartments that participate in the early, ongoing andlate post-infection responses; and to determine their contribution to the establishment of herd immunity, at leastin part through the generation of protective B cell memory. The latter is an essential feature that could beuncoupled from the persistence of serum antibodies; and therefore, would go unrecognized unless formallytested. We postulate that the establishment of cellular B cell memory and the ability to evaluate its magnitudeand quality will be critical to track the risk of the population to short-term re-infection and seasonal exposure; todesign vaccines capable to trigger this protective feature; and to develop SARS-CoV-2 B cell-based diagnostictests. These goals will be accomplished using blood samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected and convalescentindividuals through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cellresponses through multidimensional B cell flow cytometry A precise adjudication of the cellular origin,magnitude, and persistence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 B cell response will be accomplished by antigen-specificflow cytometry and validated by multiplex antigen assays and single cell analysis of the B cell populations. Aim2. Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell memory and herd immunity. Phenotypic features andantigen-specific flow cytometry assays established in aim 1, will be applied to intermediate and late post-infectiontime points in order to understand: a) the cellular compartments in which SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell memoryresides; b) its quality, magnitude and distribution within the population; c) its provenance (whether from early oflate cellular precursors); and d) its concordance or conversely, uncoupling from serological responses and thegeneration of long-lived plasma cells (LLPC).",1,"1b, 1d"
P25515,Identifying the molecular determinants of ketamine's antidepressant action,"Ketamine was recently approved for chronic depression in patients who did not respond to other forms of treatment. Unlike ""classical"" antidepressants, ketamine acts rapidly and has sustained effects after a single infusion by changing the brain structure and increasing the amount of neuron-to-neuron contacts (also known as synapses). Despite its proven efficacy, ketamine can have serious side effects, including the potential for abuse. Therefore, understanding how ketamine's antidepressant effects are produced can be used to improve effectiveness and reduce potentially harmful side effects. We recently demonstrated that ketamine's antidepressant action involves the activation of the protein synthesis machinery in neurons that inhibit other neurons. In the current proposal, we want to determine which receptor is responsible for this effect and which newly synthesized proteins produce ketamine's antidepressant effect. By combining cutting-edge molecular, cellular, and behavioural techniques, we will understand the underpinnings of ketamine and improve treatment options for people with depressive disorders.",6,6y
C17927,Phase 1 COVID-19 Data and Connectivity - National Core Study (Phase 1 D&C-NCS),"The Data and Connectivity study sits across the other National Core Studies and delivers a national health data research capability to support COVID-19 research questions, ensuring datasets are discoverable and accessible and linkages are established to answer the priority research questions from the other five National Core Studies. Making data available for wider research use will increase the scope of benefits beyond the specific studies above, leading to unexpected benefits and boosting UK research capacity more generally, increasing return on investment for the NCS programme.  Data integration and harmonisation of methods and standards will enable rapid research and development of new interventions and technologies across the spectrum of COVID-19, and knowledge and technology transfer to other clinical and public health areas.  Collation and linkage between datasets is critical to bringing the core studies together, ensuring that each of them can deliver against their policy priorities e.g. hospital data may not currently be linked with GP data and wider community data (e.g. socioeconomic data or data on housing and the built environment). Access, cleaning, linkage and use of these datasets together is needed to fully understand links between these factors and outcomes.  Delivery of the COVID-19 Data and Connectivity Study will involve close interaction with data custodians, the public and patients, and providers of UK-wide national Trusted Research Environments (TREs) to ensure the required data is stored safely and securely, made readily available to approved researchers and is associated with compute, analytical and data services that make it easier to address priority research questions in a transparent and trustworthy way.  Phase 1 will:  • Continue to respond to emerging COVID-19 research priorities, mapping key datasets required by the National Core Studies, NIHR UPH Studies and SAGE sub-groups to allow research which can inform policy and operational decision making across the UK  • Further develop the data infrastructure and services across the UK to allow faster access to high priority health, administrative, molecular, and behavioural data assets for researchers working on the most important COVID-related studies, ensuring priority research questions can be answered efficiently, in a transparent and trustworthy way.  • Strengthen and extend the existing national Trusted Research Environments (TRE) and UK Health Data Research Innovation Gateway infrastructure through inclusive four nations approach ensuring the priority datasets for COVID-19 research are findable, accessible, inter-operable and reusable (FAIR) as a single ""shop window""",11,11d
C00382,"Disability and Community: Dis/engagement, dis/enfranchisement, dis/parity and dissent - aka The D4D project","Disability and Community: Dis/engagement, Dis/enfranchisement, Dis/parity and Dissent (aka the D4D project) will investigate the evolving ways in which disabled people express, perform, experience and practise 'community'. The work will be informed by critical disability theory, and it will foreground the knowledge and lived experiences of disabled people. The project team brings together academics from a range of disciplines, community investigators with expertise in performance and arts practice, and community partners (including Shape, Accentuate and DRUK). Our goals are to learn from participating communities, to build understanding, to generate opportunities for connections, solidarity, resilience and activism, and to create meaningful legacies for the communities and partners involved. D4D will explore aspects of the historical, clinical, institutional, political and technological construction of disabled communities, and trace the ways in which community members have contested, rejected and embraced these varied possibilities over time. The project will facilitate agency and empowerment among participants, facilitate knowledge exchange and professional development, and create new spaces for dialogue and intervention. D4D's research question is: In what ways are disabled people connected/disconnected to/from surrounding communities, and how might they trouble existing affiliations, re-situate themselves, and re-shape communities around them? The team will explore this question while drawing on disability studies and community research literature, and engaging in continual collaboration and reflection (on issues of power, ethics and research practice, for example). There will be 8 work streams: WS1 - will explore issues of integration and marginalization, focusing on two settings: mainstream schools and the work-place. It will explore lived experience of 'inclusion'. This work will combine ethnographic studies, with a series of cultural animation workshops through which disabled participants will articulate and explore aspects of inclusion and marginalization. WS2 - will explore the ways in which technology might impact on or facilitate experiences of social belonging, by focusing on play. The steam will support methodological development, as it will involve exploring the ways in which new technologies can support the agentic participation of non-traditional research participants. WS3 - will examine the origins, development and future of the Disability Arts community. In particular, this will involve exploring the tensions within 'identity arts' movements regarding issues of affiliation and community. WS4 - this strand will explore how participants form, experience and express alternative community, as well as how they manage their (dis)placement and disqualification by mainstream society. This research will also support disabled communities critically responds to clinical practice. WS5- In this strand, arts based research will drive an investigation of past, present and future disabled communities. In particular, through the creation and exhibition of an interactive art-piece, 'Evolution', mainstream audiences will be asked to consider disability perspectives on such matters as eugenics and genetic screening. WS6 - Playful Bodies, Technology and Community will address technologies, social change and the body, and identify the implications for disability and community, while drawing on player studies, social media research, collaborative game design, and public play. WS7 - Ethics, reflection and learning for participation will inform all the above activities and support the practices and professional development of all those taking part.

C19627,Development of a nanoparticle-based vaccine candidate to the SARS-CoV-2,"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus in the province of Wuhan in China is an international concern since there is a risk for spreading the infection outside the Chinese territory. The spreading of the virus is facilitated by its human to human transmission by aerosols.  Several approaches must be taken to limit the spread of the virus, including quarantine, the decontamination of infected areas, early detection in patients, etc.  It is also widely recognized that vaccination is from far the most efficient approach to control the spreading of the infection and protect the population.  We propose first the development of a vaccine component-1 to the SARS-CoV-2 based on the use of an immune enhancer nanoparticle coupled to peptides derived from the virus nucleocapsid. This vaccine will trigger a protective immune response against the virus. The use of peptide antigens allows moving very fast in the development of the vaccine candidate. Besides the speed, this approach has the merit to induce a broad CTL immune response that should also trigger protection to any strains of the virus that are related to the first invading coronavirus, like the SARS virus of 2002. Second, we will design and prepare a second vaccine component that will elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2. Finally, both components will be combined in one vaccine formulation that will provide robust protection to the SARS-CoV-2 and also to related viruses, like the SRAS virus of 2002.  The nanoparticles used to attach the vaccine antigens are very stable. The coupling to the nanoparticle will stabilize the antigens and generate a very stable vaccine formulation that can be stockpiled for a long period (years) without loss of integrity. This is an advantage because to insure preparedness to other epidemics with related viruses.",7,7a
C01018,Recherche Fondamentale (basic research) - Marqueurs prognostiques muqueux et systémiques de la résistance versus la tolérance dans la pandémie COVID-19    Mucosal and systemic clinical prognosis markers of resistance and tolerance in COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is due to infection with SARS-CoV2 coronavirus and represents a major public health threat, due to unusual rapidity of viral spreading in humans, severity of symptoms and mortality rate. Recent data reveals that the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection can vary greatly among individuals, from asymptomatic to mild symptoms, severe symptoms or critical conditions. The reasons underlying this variation in the clinical outcome remain unknown. There are two main ways a host deals with infection. One is through resistance, the ability to restrict or eliminate the infectious agent. This function is primarily performed by the immune system. The second, disease tolerance, is the capacity of the host to avoid or restrict the pathological consequences of an infection. The rate of contamination by virus spreading to highly exposed healthcare professionals has been dramatic. Through longitudinal multi-parametric and pathophysiological analysis, the study will provide directly in human, the proof of the concept that disease tolerance allows for homeostatic protection against an ongoing viral infection in such emerging pandemic infection. We speculate from past experience and know-how on mucosal regulatory pathways maintaining protection and homeostasis against viral infections, that IgA and Treg/Th17 division of labor is essential both for controlling virus and at the same time ensuring a safe host responsiveness, with minimal collateral damage, from onset to end of infection and resolution of disease. The clinical follow up of the individuals, from early onset mild clinical symptoms to more severe pathological signs (respiratory failure, morbidity, mortality), will allow to retrospectively identify severity and risk individuals associated to failure of disease tolerance mechanisms. This knowledge should help to better control COVID-19 pandemia and would provide a scientific basis, un-valuable for identifying individuals that should benefit from therapeutic intervention and/or vaccination strategies.",4,"4a, 4b"

P22950,Modeling toolkit to evaluate multifaceted control strategies for seasonal and pandemic influenza,"PROJECT SUMMARY  We will develop a data-driven model of seasonal and pandemic influenza transmission throughout the US to  accelerate robust assessments of multifaceted influenza intervention strategies. We will work closely with the  CDC Modeling Network to advance the fidelity, transparency and translation of models as an evidence base for  influenza policy making, prevention and control. This project extends a metapopulation model of influenza  transmission within and between 217 major metropolitan areas in the US that we are developing in  collaboration with the CDC Modeling Network. The model includes travel between cities, age- and risk-group  specific susceptibility, probability of clinical outcomes, intervention efficacies and uptake rates, as well as the  impacts of local climate and school calendars on transmission rates. Using a range of public health,  epidemiological, societal and economic metrics, the model can flexibly evaluate thousands of candidate  intervention strategies, including time- and location-based combinations of vaccines, antivirals, and social  distancing measures with potential subgroup-specific prioritization.  Our proposal includes four major aims. In Aim 1, we will extend our US Influenza Model to include the co-  circulation of multiple viruses competing via transient heterosubtypic immunity. We will derive new estimates  for the duration and magnitude of heterosubtypic immunity and design strain-specific strategies for effectively  controlling co-circulating seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. In Aim 2, we will evaluate intervention  strategies that leverage newly approved and combined antiviral drugs. We will fit within-host viral dynamic  models to clinical data on new antivirals to estimate the efficacy of various drug regimens in different  subpopulations with respect to disease severity, infectiousness, and the risk of antiviral resistance. In Aim 3,  we will build a granular within-city model of influenza transmission based on abundant data and local  collaborations with public health and healthcare leaders in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Area. We will  apply the model to elucidate socioeconomic and geographic disparities in influenza risk and design  interventions that ameliorate such gaps. In Aim 4, we will build an interactive visualization platform that allows  users to specify epidemic scenarios, implement layered interventions as simulations unfold, and view the  model dynamics through the lens of a surveillance module based on the CDCÃ¢Â€Â™s FluView Interactive portal.  We will work extensively with the CDC Modeling Network to build a diverse portfolio of validated models and  best practices for collaborative decision support. Our projects will contribute flexible models for the evaluation  of multifaceted influenza interventions, elucidate competition among influenza viruses and the efficacies of  novel antivirals, and provide insights into socioeconomic disparities in influenza burden. Furthermore, our  innovative visualization tool will broadly support the translation of science to public policy.","3, 8","3a, 3b, 3c, 8b"

P22467,"Pellino-1, a novel target for treatment of congenital Zika syndrome","Project Summary  Zika virus (ZIKV) a newly emerging mosquito-borne Flavivirus, has been associated with the neurological  autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in fetuses and  infants, including microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine growth restriction. Currently, neither  treatments nor approved vaccines are available for use in humans to protect against ZIKV infection. It has  been reported that ZIKV infection of susceptible pregnant dams led to placenta damage and virus transmission  to the fetus. Placental trophoblasts are epithelial cells that invade and remodel the uterine wall during  placentation and are permissive to ZIKV infection. Human neural stem or progenitor cells (NS/PCs) were more  susceptible to ZIKV replication than mature cortical neurons. ZIKV induces more cell death in human NS/PCs  than in mature cortical neurons and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in attenuated cell growth.  Inflammation is a critical contributor to both normal development and injury in the immature brain. Intrauterine  ZIKV infection during early pregnancy was reported to cause placental inflammation, and a reduction of  neonatal brain cortical thickness. ZIKV- induced toll-like receptor 3 activation in human cerebral organoids was  accompanied by depletion of NS/PCs. Our collaborator of this project, Dr. Ping Wu, has recently shown that  ZIKV- induced differential innate immune responses, particularly, inflammatory cytokine production correlates  with alterations in neuronal differentiation among NS/PCs. Thus, direct ZIKV infection and/or ZIKV- induced  inflammatory responses in placental trophoblasts and NS/PCs contribute to CZS formation. Pellino (Peli)-1, an  E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a positive regulator in pathogen recognition receptor- mediated inflammatory cytokine  responses. It is expressed on many cell types and is enriched in the central nervous system (CNS) tissues. We  have recently found that Peli1 is required for viral replication and induction of inflammatory cytokines and  chemokines in microglial cells and neurons during another falvivirus- West Nile virus infection. We also found  that Peli1 expression was upregulated in human NS/PCs following ZIKV infection. Treatment with the Peli1  inhibitor Smaducin6 reduced both viral load and inflammatory cytokine production in ZIKV-infected NS/PCs.  The long-term goal of our project is to understand the molecular and immune mechanisms of ZIKV-induced  neurological diseases. Specifically, we hypothesize that Peli1 promotes ZIKV infection, induction of  inflammatory immune responses and cell death, resulting in impaired neurogenesis and CZS. We will first  determine the role of Peli1 in an in vitro model of CZS. Next, we will evaluate the therapeutic effects of  Smaducin6 in animal models of CZS. Results from this study will provide important insights into ZIKV  pathogenesis. In addition, identifying the mediators responsible for alterations in brain development is key to  prevention and treatment of CZS.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"

P23186,A Fully Integrated Point-of-Care Test for Ebola,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The objective of this proposal is to develop a new point-of-care test (POCT)Ã¢Â€Â""the D4 assayÃ¢Â€Â""for early field-  detection of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Currently, EBOV is diagnosed by RNA detection using reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR requires a makeshift BSL-4 grade laboratory in the  field, expensive equipment, and highly trained personnel. Other POCTs, including the user-friendly lateral-flow  assay (LFA), lack the sensitivity for early detection that is critical for timely intervention with the available  antibody cocktail that yields 90% survival rates for patients with low viremia. Our objective is motivated by an  urgent clinical need for a POCT that (1) detects EBOV infection in the field quickly and reliably, (2) requires little  on-field infrastructure, (3) yields results in 30 min, and (4) matches or exceeds the performance of RT-PCR. To  achieve these goals, we have designed an integrated POCT the D4 assay that has four simple stepsÃ¢Â€Â""dispense,  dissolve, diffuse, and detect that require limited handling and skill to perform. This new-frontier technology takes  advantage of the presence of an unmistakable, viral secreted glycoprotein sGP that is present in the serum of  infected patients very early in infection. We have generated customized monoclonal antibodies (Abs) for sGP to  use in the D4 assay. The current prototype D4 assay that we have designed detects EBOV infection at least one  day earlier than RT-PCR in infected monkeys and at a far lower cost than RT-PCR or LFA. In this proposal,  we plan to advance our development and improve the sensitivity of the D4 assay further as well as reduce the  assay time from 60 min to 30 min. Our strategy is to increase the equilibrium binding constant of our current Ab  pair from ~10-9 M to ~10-11 M with antibody affinity maturation techniques and high-throughput screening of  antibody pairs. The enhanced D4 assay kit will have inkjet-printed capture and detection antibodies on a protein  and cell-resistant polymer brush on a glass plate encased in a passive capillarity microfluidics chip. The assay  output will be fluorescence of microspots on the D4 chip. We have developed a portable handheld fluorescence  detector to capture and image the spots and automatically convert them into the concentration of analytes for  quantitation and uploaded to a secure server. The design will be rigorously tested and validated with samples  from infected human cells and laboratory-challenged non-human primates. At the completion of this project, we  will have a field-ready, user-friendly, and highly sensitive POCT that will allow healthcare workers to detect EBOV  in serum, blood, or other bodily fluids in 30 min. The new design will push the current boundaries of EBOV  detection and facilitate more expedient deployment of infection control and patient support measures that can  yield 90% survival rates or better if implemented early in infection. Because the D4 POCT is multiplexable, it will  set a precedent for broader utility beyond EBOV to diagnose many other infectious diseases.",1,1a
P21159,Convalescent Plasma to Limit Coronavirus Associated Complications: A Randomized Blinded Phase 2 Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Plasma to Placebo in COVID-19 hospitalized pa,"Abstract: There are not any scientifically proven or approved therapies for COVID-19. Convalescent plasma (CP), whichis plasma that is obtained from people who have recovered from COVID-19, contains antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes this disease. CP has a long and storied history of improving symptoms and mortalityfrom other pandemic diseases, such as 1918 and 2009 influenza and SARS, as well as a myriad of other toxin-mediated and infectious diseases. Thus, CP is a rationally based and readily available therapeutic option forCOVID-19. There are thousands of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in the New York City area whohave donated their plasma to help others who are suffering from this disease. This project is a collaborativerandomized blinded placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with CP in hospitalized patientswith COVID-19 that is being conducted at three New York University (NYU) Langone Health hospitals inManhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island, Bellevue Hospital Center, and three Montefiore Medical Center (MMC)hospitals in the Bronx. We designed and launched this trial as the pandemic surged in NYC by rapidly developinga multicenter, well-powered Phase 2 trial via regional collaborations established by Einstein-Montefiore andNYU-Langone CTSAs with support from the New York Blood Center (NYBC). The hypothesis underpinning thetrial is that compared to placebo, administration of CP will avert respiratory deterioration, the main cause of deathin patients with COVID-19. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To examine whether CP decreases thelikelihood of respiratory deterioration in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 compared to placebo (saline solution,SS) at 14 days from administration, and 2) To identify associations between quantitative and qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who receive CP and placebo.The public health benefit of proof of CP efficacy against COVID-19, which has already caused 338,000 infectionsand 21,845 deaths in the United States and 187,250 infections and 1,127 deaths in New York City would be atremendous and public health advance that could save thousands of lives.",6,6b
C04655,"COVID-19: role of co-infections, and drug repurposing for treament","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19. Our lack of understanding about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the human airways is an important barrier to developing effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. So far, we know that COVID-19 disease severity increases with age, with very few severe cases among children. In China, the case fatality ratio was 60-year olds, rising to 15% in those >80.   This project will focus on two aspects of the host response of infection, studying how the cells that line the airway respond to the virus, and whether the recruited immune cells (focussing on the behaviour of neutrophils that are the first to respond to infection) the help reduce viral load or contribute to airway damage and the build-up of debris in the airways. We will use an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection model of the airway epithelium from young children, adults and the elderly. Our objectives are to determine:  1) if the primary site of infection - the nasal epithelium - of the elderly exhibit increased viral replication and increased inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to children. 2) the molecular mechanisms that govern age-determinants of COVID-19 disease severity using single-cell genomic analysis of cultured cells and comparing outputs to the same data from age-matched COVID-19 patients using scRNAseq. 3) whether the innate immune response to SARS-CoV2 infected airway epithelium exacerbates inflammation and contributes to the severity of illness in the elderly by measuring a) the intensity of immune cell (neutrophil) recruitment to the airway b) epithelial damage and c) neutrophil phenotype and function. It is important that we understand the reasons for these fundamental differences in responses in order to help determine what the most appropriate therapy is for COVID-19 disease in these age groups. There is much debate about the utility of novel and exsiting anti-virals as well as immune modulator therapies including NSAIDs and Tocilizumab. This project will rapidly deliver new understanding about the viral pathogenesis and the cause of these age-related disparties in disease outcomes. Not only will this help support the development of effective therapeutics in the short-term, underlining the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates, but it may also highlight important risk factors or protective mechanisms that could be used to develop early interventional or prophylaxtic therapies in the long-term.","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4a, 4b"

C00925,School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study : Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-COV-2 (HEROS) Supplement,"COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly affecting humans around the globe.While initial epidemiological data have focused on cases that resulted in severe respiratory disease seenpredominantly in adults, little information regarding the infection burden in children is available. This iscomplicated by the observation that many virologically-confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic. Homeenvironments are established sources of exposure that exacerbate symptoms of asthma and home-basedinterventions are proven effective. Prior to the inception of the School Inner-City Asthma Study (SICAS-1), noAmerican study had comprehensively evaluated the relationship between urban exposures in school,classroom, and home environments and asthma morbidity. Nearly all elementary school children spend 7 to12 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. From SICAS-1, we learned thatstudent classroom-specific mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutant exposure is associated withworsening symptoms. We also demonstrated our ability to reduce these exposures in a busy, school setting.Our proposal builds upon our established, successful school-based infrastructure to determine whether aschool/classroom intervention will efficiently and effectively improve asthma morbidity by reducing theseexposures. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of school/classroom based environmental intervention inreducing asthma morbidity in urban schoolchildren. Our central hypothesis is that reducing classroom/schoolexposure to mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutants will decrease asthma morbidity in students withasthma. We plan to test this hypothesis in an intervention study of 250 elementary students with asthma frommultiple classrooms in 40 Boston inner-city elementary schools. Our clinical trial aims are to determine theeffectiveness of a school/classroom based environmental intervention (school integrated pest managementand classroom air purifying filter units within these schools) to reduce asthma morbidity. The supplement tothe parent grant is to leverage the cohort for the to participate in the multi-center survey entitled HumanEpidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), study. This study can be rapidly implemented andrealistically conducted without necessitating any visits to a clinical research center. In addition to the need forsurveying children for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, this study will allow a comparison betweenchildren with asthma and other atopic conditions and children without those conditions through remote surveysand collection of samples. This study is an unprecedented, high impact opportunity to leverage the parent trialwith in scope in understanding how SARS-C0V-2 differentially affects children with the condition of interest,compared to children without it.","3, 4","3a, 3b, 4a"
P23291,A functional evolutionary genetic approach to combat viral infection,"Project Summary  Humans are under increasing threat from viruses that spill over from animal reservoirs. Most of  these viral diseases lack targeted treatments. We speculate that this unmet medical need might  be addressable by first understanding the evolutionary principles underlying antiviral immune  responses. A major component of innate immunity in mammals is the interferon response.  Interferon induces hundreds of genes, many of which encode effector proteins that suppress  viral infection. In mammals, these antiviral effectors are rapidly evolving, most likely in  response to the genetic ""arms race"" continually occurring between virus and host. Further,  certain mammalian orders, such as primates, rodents, bats, and carnivores, are particularly rich  in viruses that have the potential to spill over into humans. We hypothesize that the genomes of  these viral zoonotic reservoirs encode unique antiviral effectors that may be harnessed to  combat human viral pathogens. The goals of this project are to identify, characterize, and  validate the efficacy of novel antiviral proteins from diverse non-model mammalian species.  State-of-the-art genetic screening platforms will be used to discover antiviral genes in primary  cell cultures obtained from multiples species in the following mammalian orders: Primate,  Rodentia, Chiroptera, and Carnivora. Validated effectors will be characterized mechanistically  with a suite of virological, biochemical, molecular, and cell biological approaches. The potential  for these effectors to suppress human viruses will be tested in murine models of human viral  disease. Outcomes will include the creation of the first comprehensive Mammalian Antiviral  Protein Atlas, the discovery of new genetically-encoded antiviral mechanisms, and proof-of-  concept that human viral disease can be thwarted by naturally occurring proteins from other  species. The impact of this proposal will be the development of a new area of biomedical  research at the intersection of virology, immunology, and evolutionary biology. Long term  prospects include harnessing the results of these studies to inspire alternative approaches to  antiviral drug development.","1, 6","1b, 1c, 6a"
C00911,/7: Longitudinal evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on high-risk new and expectant mothers,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant environmental event in living history and is leading tounprecedented social, economic and health consequences. There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequences fortheir children's birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre -existingsubstance use, mental health conditions and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across seven geographically-representative sites from theNIH HEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University, OregonHealth Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter, University of Vermont and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartum women intoa multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial and substance use risk acrosspregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioral developmentduring the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatal COVID-19 relatedstress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress and infant temperament and neurodevelopmentand 2) substance use, mental health and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negative COVID-19 relatedhealth and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey, birth and postpartumdata will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers per site (providing a totalconsortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19 related experiences andresponses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohorts obtained prior to the pandemic.Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poor mental health and low socialeconomic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources as resilience factors that influenceCOVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioral outcomes. The effects of geographiclocation will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity, variation in local government policies andresource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect and bank longitudinal perinatal biospecimens inN=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the biological mechanismsthrough which the effects on maternal psychological and physical health influence offspring brain and behavioraldevelopment. Through this analysis of COVID-19 related stress, contextual factors and child outcomes, we willdevelop comprehensive understanding of effects and modifiers of this event on health outcomes in individualsthat vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life, one of the most sensitive timepoints in human development.","4, 10","4a, 10a, 10b"
C19830,The COVID-19 pandemic and its longitudinal associations with youth's mental health: Examining risk and protective factors,"In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian government implemented several restrictive measures since March 2020 to decrease social contacts and increase physical distance. Although these measures were necessary to limit the transmission of the virus, there are reasons to be concerned about their impact on the adolescents, who are probably the group with the greatest need to socialize with their peers. In fact, it may have been more difficult for adolescents during the pandemic to have their first romantic relationships, to be involved in schools or get a job. Some youth may be even more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic, namely, those having experienced prior adverse life events such as child maltreatment or bullying, and adolescents belonging to a sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ2+). Indeed, independent of the pandemic, these two groups tend to experience greater rates of stigma, social isolation, and mental health issues compared to their non-victimized, non-minoritized peers. Moreover, as the pandemic deprived them of the majority of extra-familial supports and/or programs, it may have been more difficult for these adolescents to cope. The proposed research will examine the effects of child maltreatment and bullying on youth's mental health in the aftermath of the pandemic (e.g., COVID-related stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety/depression, alcohol and drug) and the impacts of support and extra-curricular activities on their well-being. We will also examine these outcomes among sexual and gender minority youth. This study will document the progression of mental health among 3,900 adolescents, before (school year 2019-2020), during (school year 2020-2021) and after (school year 2021-2022, present proposal) the COVID-19 pandemic.

P23832,Developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for pandemic preparedness,"Antiviral drugs will be key in the management of future virus outbreaks. For each virus family with epidemic/pandemic potential, stockpiles of potent drugs are needed that can be deployed when a new pathogen emerges. Such broader-acting drugs (targeting conserved viral functions) are needed as of 'Äúday one'Äù of an outbreak, for treatment and prophylaxis (e.g., in HCW and frail patients). In combination with quarantine measures, such drugs will delay (global) spread, allowing time for vaccine-development. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, PANVIPREP'Äôs core partners have successfully collaborated in leading European antiviral drug research projects. This provides a solid scientific basis in combination with translational drug discovery expertise. The team includes virologists, biochemists, structural biologists, medicinal chemists and pharmacokinetics experts. Previously developed know-how and toolboxes will be a major asset to achieve immediate impact. PANVIPREP aims to greatly expand the antiviral portfolio and identify novel druggable targets of high-risk RNA viruses. Hits will be identified through (i) phenotypic antiviral screening of compound libraries (ii) structure-based drug design, (iii) in silico screening, supported by the latest machine-learning methods. We will deliver 25 to 50 high-quality, broad(er)-spectrum (pan-genus/pan-family) hit molecules/hit series. Two of these will be developed to the early lead stage, including proof of concept in animal infection models. Remaining hits will serve as chemical tool-compounds to explore mechanisms of action thereby identifying novel druggable targets in RNA virus replication.

The workflow will integrate best practices in antiviral drug discovery with a range of methodological innovations, including AI-based methods, thus renovating and accelerating the antiviral hit discovery pipeline future use and contributing to pandemic preparedness.",6,6a
P25351,Informing interventions to support children and young people with long-term effects of infections in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic era: Analyses of linked survey data and electronic health record data in England,"Background   SARS-CoV-2 infection (which causes COVID-19 disease) is generally mild in children and young people. However, a large number have symptoms weeks after infection, loosely termed 'long-COVID'. Previous studies, and an online discussion group with families affected by long-COVID held to inform this study, have shown that symptoms are wide-ranging and can be severe. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence considers long-COVID to include the broadly-defined 'ongoing symptomatic COVID-19' (signs and symptoms 4-12 weeks after infection) and 'post-COVID-19 syndrome' (signs and symptoms more than 12 weeks after infection), but does not specify what these symptoms are. The likelihood of children and young people developing long-COVID, which of them are most at risk, and their long-term outlook, are unknown.    Many different viral and bacterial infections besides SARS-CoV-2 can cause lingering health effects in children and young people. It is not clear if the reasons for developing long-term health effects from other infections are similar or different to long-COVID. It is also not known whether the healthcare needs are similar or different. Consequently, the burden on the NHS and wider society is unknown. All of these gaps in our knowledge make it very difficult to plan healthcare services, and for doctors to advise at-risk and affected children and young people.   The Schools Infection Survey   The Schools Infection Survey (SIS) is the only nationwide study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schoolchildren (4-18-year-olds) in England. During the academic years 2020-21 (SIS-1) and 2021-22 (SIS-2) it regularly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and recorded symptoms and school absence for all participants. The Department for Education also has data on school absence.   SIS-2 recently reported that 1.8% of primary school pupils and 4.8% of secondary school pupils had long-COVID.   Linking to data on numbers of GP visits, hospital admissions, related diagnoses, and prescriptions following an infection in SIS participants could give us a lot of information about how SARS-CoV-2 and other infections affect children and young people, as well as the burden and cost to the NHS. Using linked data would avoid using more questionnaires, which the discussion group said can be burdensome for families with an ill child.   Factors which contribute to vulnerability to long-term health effects, such as age, gender, deprivation, pre-existing illnesses, and multiple infections, will be investigated.   Research Questions and Methods   This research will address the following questions:   1. How many children and young people in England have long-COVID, what are their risk factors, what are their healthcare/educational needs, and what is the associated cost?   2. How similar or different are the risk factors, healthcare/educational needs and cost, and numbers affected, for long-term effects of other infections (using fever as a marker) in children and young people in England?   To do this, SIS data will be linked to data on health service attendances, diagnoses, prescriptions, and school absence. Different infectious causes of fever will be investigated.   The results from SIS will be scaled up for all children in England.   Use of Study Findings   This four-year study begins in April 2023. Within the first 18 months, the risk of long-term outcomes will have been analysed, and initial cost estimates produced. The findings will be published in academic journals and policy reports, and shared with the media. Information will be produced to provide much-needed reassurance for affected families, and to empower families to decide when to manage symptoms at home and when to seek a healthcare consultation. Families affected by long-COVID will be engaged regularly throughout the study, and will be crucial to shaping the study outputs. They have already advised that videos would be more accessible than a lot of written information.","4, 9","4d, 9e"

This increase in human research, creates an urgent need for improved bioethics leadership, training,  policy and research. It is, therefore, critical and timely to ensure that researchers and members of institutional  review board (IRB) in Mali have the requisite knowledge, and capacity to ensure the research meets ethical,  cultural, and regulatory expectations. To meet the ethics training needs of Mali, we propose a research ethics  capacity building program to strengthen research ethics education and research in Mali through an innovative  model of sustainable capacity development to prepare the next generation of ethics researchers. This program  will be based on close collaboration between two institutions Ã¢Â€Â"" the George Washington University Milken Institute  School of Public Health (GWU), USA and University of Science, Techniques & Technologies of Bamako  (USTTB), Mali.

We will implement a faculty development program for  selected Malian faculty aimed at enhancing analytical capacity in ethics research and training. The selected  Malian faculty will participate in intensive courses in US, work with GWSPH faculty in developing curricula and  co-delivery of ethics curriculum during year 2. Specific Aim 2: To develop a research ethics specialization  within the existing USTTB Masters of Public Health (MPH) program in order to train a core group of  professionals with expertise in research ethics in Mali. We will develop a new curriculum in research ethics  within the MPH program at USTTB. The Ethics modules will also be offered as part of a one year Diplome. We  will also offer short term training workshops and webinars at USTTB including both basic and advanced topics  each year. Specific Aim 3: To promote research around key priorities for research ethics in Mali. We will  through our trainees conduct relevant national research on ethics to inform public health, training priorities and  health care delivery including ethics of research on infectious and emerging diseases as well as genetics and  genomics. Specific Aim 4: To create a dedicated Ã¢Â€ÂœResearch Ethics UnitÃ¢Â€Â within USTTB in Mali.

P22722,Development of CM-IAV1 for Treatment of High-risk Pandemic Influenzas,"Project Summary  Health and human services (HHS) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  (BARDA) have suggested a severe pandemic influenza outbreak is the greatest current threat to national and  global security. The Center for Disease Control rates H7N9 as the most threatening of the Influenza A viruses  as it, along with H5N1, have fatality rates of ~40% and ~60%, respectively. Models have predicted that an  H7N9 pandemic could result in infection of one third of the world population and death of ~40% of those  infected, making it the deadliest virus in recorded history (the 1918 flu had a fatality rate of ~2.5%). There is  currently no approved therapeutic for severe influenza infection, and in the case of H7N9 ~98% of those  infected develop severe infection and require hospitalization. This project seeks to provide some hope of  protection in such an outbreak by advancing the most effective broad-spectrum human antibody therapeutic  currently available, CM-IAV1. CM-IAV1 is a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal that is cross-reactive for  group 1 and group 2 avian influenza. CM-IAV1 has already been shown to protect mice against lethal (non-  laboratory strain) H7N9 and H5N1 when given in a single dose 72 hours post-infection. To leverage this  outstanding preclinical data, we have assembled a world-class team that is focused on advancing CM-IAV1  into the clinic. The experiments presented in this application will take a promising preclinical agent and,  together with our continued and parallel investments, create a clinical asset with enormous potential to reduce  morbidity and mortality associated influenza infection from the most relevant CDC- prioritized pandemic  strains. We believe that development of this antibody, at this time, and by this team represents the best hope  of offering meaningful lifesaving protection against the terrifying possibility of a global Influenza A outbreak.  The overarching goal of this project is to advance a novel broad-spectrum, lifesaving therapeutic for pandemic  influenza A infection from promising preclinical candidate through investigational new drug (IND)-enabling  studies to IND filing.","4, 6","4e, 6a, 6g, 6h, 6i"
P22765,Rapid response to pandemic influenza via multi-antigen RNA-based vaccine,"Project Summary  The proposal is to develop an RNA-based, rapid-response influenza vaccine prototype, supporting NIAIDÃ¢Â€Â™s call  for nucleic acid-based vaccines that protect against pandemic influenza threats. Avian influenza A H7N9 causes  severe respiratory illness with a high mortality rate. The virusÃ¢Â€Â™ high zoonotic capacity has raised serious concerns  over the possibility of a pandemic, with the risk being potentially similar to that of H5 strains. While progress has  been made in the development of H5 influenza vaccines, H7 products have lagged. The proposed H7N9 vaccine  will be innovative in two respects. 1) H7N9 vaccines typically focus on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein as the  main immunogen, but immune responses to HA H7, while protective, are weaker than those against other HAs  in humans. Therefore, Tiba will develop a multi-antigen approach, specifically including optimized ratios of the  virion proteins HA, NA, M1, and NP. This approach is expected to increase the immunogenicity and heterotypic  protective potential of the vaccine. 2) Conventional lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are the mainstay of nucleic  acid delivery, require a large proportion of Ã¢Â€ÂœstructuralÃ¢Â€Â lipid, resulting in a relatively low RNA content. Tiba has  developed a modified dendrimer nanoparticle system that maximizes the delivered RNA mass content, protecting  RNA from degradation, and enables efficient uptake by cells in vivo. The prototype composition developed here  will serve as a platform into which any outbreak antigen sequences could be rapidly implemented. Tiba will meet  the near-term goal of developing a prototype HA/NA/M1/NP vaccine to advance toward live virus challenge  experiments and IND-enabling studies in Phase 2 by completing three Phase 1 Aims. The first is to validate  performance of a H7 HA replicon RNA-based expression construct in vivo. This will be generated and formulated  with TibaÃ¢Â€Â™s delivery system and tested in BALB/c mice at 0.2 Ã'Âµg, 2.0 Ã'Âµg, and 20 Ã'Âµg to measure cellular and  humoral immunogenicity. These studies will establish the minimum dose required for subsequent experiments.  In the second Aim, Tiba will generate and test individual formulations of NA, M1, and NP mRNA and replicon  candidates, validating their performance in vivo at similarly increasing doses by T cell ELISpots and, for NA, also  by ELISA to measure antibody responses. The final Aim is to compose a multi-antigen prototype vaccine  combining the optimal balance of HA replicon RNA with NA, M1, and NP RNAs by co-encapsulating the four  payloads in a single nanoparticle formulation. This multi-antigen candidate vaccine will be tested in male and  female BALB/c mice, in comparison to HA-only and irrelevant antigen-coding control vaccines to determine if  immunogenicity is retained against all components, and if anti-HA responses benefit from inclusion of the  additional virion proteins. The candidate prototypes will be compared to state-of-the-art LNP formulations to  evaluate the performance of TibaÃ¢Â€Â™s delivery technology compared to the current gold-standard for RNA vaccines.",7,7a

C20707,Engaging Stakeholders and Planning for the Implementation of Virtual Care Competencies within Mental Health Care,"The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid transition to virtual care across Canada. However, research indicates that health care providers often felt under-prepared to make the transition to virtual practice. As virtual care becomes a mainstay of practice, there is an urgent need to develop education and training resources to ensure a workforce that is both confident and competent to provide mental health care virtually. Preliminary results indicate that efforts are underway to develop discipline-specific virtual care competencies. However, there is a lack of consensus on the virtual mental health care competencies required for interprofessional care teams. Moreover, virtual care competency frameworks rarely address the transdisciplinary training needs of professionals working in mental health contexts. As a result, our project objectives are twofold: The first goal (1) is to disseminate our virtual mental health competency framework, designed collaboratively with health professionals in mental health contexts. The second goal (2) is to leverage stakeholder input to plan for the implementation of the virtual mental health competency framework in health professions education and curriculum support. The competency framework emerging from this grant will serve as the foundation for future development and expansion of virtual care curriculum modules and virtual learning resources to further support virtual mental health care capacity building across Canada. ",10,10a
C09517,Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness,"In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has evolved as anew threat to children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolvingthat there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict diseaseprogression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization ofMIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), we will collectclinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein andantibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use thesedata to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostictests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our establishedcollaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known humancoronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immuneresponse in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of theassembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled onpeptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children withCOVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria havebeen established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus onplatform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity inchildren with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection,point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular datawill be deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of researchhave already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinicalsamples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics,and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration andproductivity.

C07425,DisCoVer: Aptamer biosensors for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces,"The high survivability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, such as metal, plastic, glass and some fabrics, means that fomite transmission is likely to play a key role in the spread of nosocomial COVID-19 infections. With effective vaccines or counteractive drugs against the virus yet to be fully realised, effective monitoring of surfaces potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 is vital to managing infection rates and protecting healthcare workers.  However, such environmental monitoring efforts are limited by the length of current viral testing processes (i.e. through swabbing, genomic extraction and RT-PCR), which prevents the identification of viral contamination in real-time. Biosensors, a group of molecules able to produce measurable signals in response to biological interactions, may overcome these challenges by allowing the rapid, specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in situ, without the need for extensive processing or specialised equipment. This work will therefore involve the development of an optical biosensor towards SARS-CoV-2 based on aptamer recognition. Through delivery to surfaces as part of an aerosolised spray reagent, this sensor will allow the 'stand-off' visualisation of viral deposits through the production of discrete areas of fluorescence thereby allowing healthcare workers to quickly triage objects in need of decontamination. Biosensor construction will be based on a 'molecular beacon' design, in which an initially quenched dual-labelled probe is restored to a fluorescent state upon SARS-CoV-2 binding. Fluorescence emission signals will be provided by bright and highly stable conjugated polymer nanoparticles, whilst molecular dynamics simulation and modelling studies will be  used to ensure high biosensor specificity/sensitivity.",5,5b
C00833,Domestic animals as potential vectors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission,"Abstract: ""The recent emergence and the rapid pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 pose a global health emergency. The origin of the virus has not been fully investigated so far. It is assumed that horseshoe bats harboring progeny coronaviruses serve as the natural reservoir host, while pangolins may serve as intermediate host. However, information on potential permissive animal species is largely lacking. Given the frequent and close contact between humans and domestic animals, is it important to elucidate whether animals such as dogs, cats or ferrets and livestock, especially cattle and pigs, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and might promote viral dissemination among animals and humans. Indeed, there is already circumstantial evidence that dogs might become infected by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this project will employ primary cells obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract of a variety of domestic animals to determine permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies will include mode of entry and spread and pathogenetic mechanisms using molecular and microscopic analyses. The results will facilitate risk assessment and prevention of potential interspecies transmission.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: domestic animals (cats, dogs) and farm animals (bovine animals, pigs)",2,2a
P22771,Kaiser Washington Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit,"Abstract  Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to human health, with many types of infections having  far-reaching, global consequences. The ability to develop vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics to  prevent, treat, and identify infectious diseases is a critical public health need. Clinical trials are an integral  component of these development efforts. Since the 1960s the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units  (VTEUs) have conducted trials that have evaluated promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates for infectious  diseases such as influenza (including pandemic and avian influenza), malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal  infection, in children and adults. In addition, the VTEUs have quickly launched trials in response to newly  emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, and Waves 1 and  5 of the H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks in China. These efforts have provided data that informed public health  policy.  This proposal is in response to a new VTEU structure which will involve greater collaboration between the  VTEUs, NIAID, and the newly formed Leadership Group structure that are all part of the NIAID Infectious  Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). The IDCRC will enhance integration and efficiency of  operations and, importantly, will foster the collaborative team science approaches now recognized as optimal  to address important and complicated public health research priorities.  Under the new cooperative agreement, the Kaiser Washington VTEU will continue to conduct clinical research  and trials, including trials conducted under an IND or IDE, within the Kaiser Washington integrated care system  to contribute to the priority research foci of NIAID. These priority areas include malaria, influenza and other  respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections and include clinical trials, including human challenge models,  and pharmacokinetic studies. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Seattle area infectious  disease research partners who will provide scientific expertise, specialized facilities, and advanced  immunologic laboratory capabilities. The Kaiser Washington VTEU will also develop and maintain surge  capacity for clinical site, pharmacy and laboratory operations to enable the rapid initiation of clinical trials and  other studies in response to emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats of public health importance.","4, 6, 7","4e, 6j, 7j"
P23185,Insight into the Ebola virus glycoprotein fusion mechanism gleaned from the 2013-2016 epidemic GP-A82V variant,"The 2013Ã¢Â€Â""2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic was orders of magnitude larger than any previous EBOV outbreak. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V, an EBOV glycoprotein mutant that came to dominate the outbreak, increases infectivity in human cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases infectivity, and to clarify its significance for Ebola virus replication and transmission, we have assembled a team that leverages NIAID resources at the IRF-Fort Detrick and the Genomic Center for Infectious Diseases at The Broad Institute. Aim 1 will be to investigate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases virion fusogenicity. Computer modeling suggests that GP-A82V destabilizes glycoprotein conformation. Mutations engineered based on the models will be tested for effects on infectivity, the reorganization of critical interactions as determined by molecular dynamics simulations, conformational equilibrium as determined by smFRET, novel assays for GP fusion, Cryo-EM of GP trimers, and crystal complexes with the NPC1 C-loop. Aim 2 will be to assess the effect of GP-A82V in the context of the EBOV Makona variant on infectivity in human cells in vitro and in humanized mice. We will generate a reverse genetic system for the ancestral EBOV Makona lineage and test the effect of GP-A82V on this background. Replication of WT and GP-A82V will be compared in U20S cells, in human dendritic cells, and in a novel humanized mouse model where the effect of GP-A82V on virus sequence adaptation to specific tissue compartments will be assessed. From these experiments we expect to clarify the significance of GP-A82V for viral replication and transmission, taking into account the genetic background of the EBOV and the species-specific effects of GP-A82V. Aim 3 will be to examine the effect of GP-A82V on neutralizing antibodies. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V is relatively resistant to neutralization by particular antibodies. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of GP, we will determine whether neutralization resistance is a general property of GP-A82V, or if this trait is specific to antibodies targeting particular regions of GP. If differential neutralization is observed with particular antibodies, the effect of these on viral titer will be tested in the humanized mouse model. We will also determine whether GP-A82V alters neutralization sensitivity to convalescent sera from Guineans infected early or later in the outbreak, and from individuals treated at Emory University. From these studies we hope to determine whether the antibody response to EBOV was different depending on whether a person was infected with virus bearing GP-A82 or GP-A82V. If differences in neutralization titer correlate with virus genotype it would contribute to understanding the factors that determine survival in an infected individual or the efficiency of transmission to people who come into contact with infected body fluids. Finally, these studies will provide valuable experimental tools that will inform our studies on GP structure and function.",1,"1b, 1c, 1d"
C06912,Mechanisms of dysregulated immunity with aging,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTSince our competitive renewal was funded last year, a global pandemic of a novel coronavirus has emergedthat has resulted in higher number of deaths than prior coronavirus outbreaks (e.g., SARS, MERS). Inparticular, older patients (i.e., > 60 years old) exhibit markedly increased mortality from COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) infections. Hence, we urgently need to understand why older people exhibit worse outcomes during COVID-19 infection. Based upon our preliminary data in mice employed in the parent R01, we hypothesize that duringCOVID-19 infection with aging, senescent alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) secrete neutrophil-attractingchemokines to induce neutrophil recruitment into the lung as well as PGE2, a pleiotropic lipid mediator, whichsuppresses alveolar macrophage proliferation and function. As alveolar macrophages are key in clearingdebris and resolving inflammation, we postulate that impairments in alveolar macrophages with aging inhibitinflammation resolution during influenza infection. In Aim 1, we will leverage the human AEC culture describedin the parent R01, to understand how aging impacts the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV2 infection inAEC and how this impacts neutrophil and alveolar macrophage. In Aim 2, we will leverage, through ourcollaborators, ongoing screens of repurposed FDA agents and novel anti-microbial peptides to identify noveltherapeutics to mitigate the effects of SARS-CoV2 infection in AECs with aging. This administrativesupplement is a natural extension of our funded NIA project on aging and the innate immune response toinfluenza, and could provide urgently needed insights to the mechanisms by which aging promotes mortality toCOVID-19 and potential therapeutics to reduce the suffering and death of older people with COVID 19.","4, 6","4a, 4b, 6g"
P21471,Roles of Pteropine Bat and Human TRIMs in Regulating Henipavirus Infection,"Project Summary  Bat species are the natural hosts of several emerging and re-emerging viruses including henipaviruses (HNVs).  Although infection with these viruses causes high case fatality rates in humans, bats appear tolerant. Old World  fruit bats in the family Pteropodidae are the natural reservoirs of HNVs, including Henda (HeV) and Nipah (NiV).  HNV-pteropine bat ecological interactions are well-studied, but the mechanisms underlying the limited  immunopathology in pteropine bats following HNV infection are unknown.  During HNV infection in humans, the antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) pathways are suppressed in part through  the antagonism of tripartite motif proteins (TRIMs). TRIMs are involved in modulating antiviral immune responses  including IFN-I production and signaling pathways. Some members of the TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligase family  stimulate the IFN-I and pro-inflammatory antiviral pathways to promote viral clearance while others antagonize  these pathways to limit immune-associated pathology. We have generated preliminary data that demonstrates  NiV activates the IFN-I signaling pathway human cells late in infection, but IFN-I signaling remains antagonized  efficiently in bat cells throughout the duration of infection. Based on this observation, we predict that bats have  evolved to express a TRIM in response to NiV infection that negatively regulates the cytoplasmic RNA recognition  pathway to prevent the cytopathic effects of innate immune signaling. Previously, we described the role of NiV  matrix protein (NiV-M) in the degradation of human TRIM6, which inhibits TRIM6-mediated activation of IKKÃŽÂµ-  dependent IFN-I production and signaling. We found that bat TRIM6 interacts with NiV-M, but bat TRIM6 resists  NiV-M mediated degradation. Due to this species-specific difference, we are interested in identifying the  mechanisms that confer degradation resistance to bat TRIM6 and understanding the roles of TRIM6 during NiV  infection.  In this proposal, we hypothesize that NiV infection induces the expression of an immunosuppressive TRIM in  bat, but not human, cells that promotes tolerance, and that species-specific differences in NiV-M-mediated  TRIM6 degradation influences the course of infection. We will interrogate our hypothesis through two specific  aims: (1) to identify pteropine and human TRIM orthologs differentially expressed after NiV infection and  determine their roles in innate immune regulation and (2) To elucidate the mechanistic roles of human and bat  TRIM6 in regulating NiV infection. Overall, the results of the proposed study will promote our understanding of  the molecular regulation of pteropine bat IFN-I pathways and potentially identify factors that facilitate batsÃ¢Â€Â™  tolerance to HNVs. Elucidating the mechanisms that promote tolerance to HNV may serve as a basis for the  development of human therapeutics.",2,"2a, 2y"

We showed evidence of repeated introductions by returning migrant workers and international travelers leading to the emergence and rapid country-wide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 lineages or variants. Bangladesh urgently needs an integrated genomics network suitable to identify and track known or novel variants.

C06919,Care Coordination for Complex Cancer Survivors in an Integrated Safety-Net System,"PROJECT SUMMARY/Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a new and significant health threat for cancer survivors. Cancer survivorsare often immuno-compromised from cancer treatment and thus may have higher risks of contracting COVID-19 in addition to adverse outcomes related to cancer. Early findings among COVID patients show thatindividuals with a history of cancer have a higher risk of severe events that resulted in admittance to theintensive care unit, ventilation support, or premature death. COVID-19 also disproportionately affectsvulnerable, underserved, and ethnic minority populations; many of these receive their health care at safety-nethealth systems such as Parkland. Those who are African American and Latino or who are uninsured are alsomore likely to have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart conditions, asthma, severe obesity,liver disease. In addition to increased risk of COVID-19 infection, cancer patients may also be experiencingdisruptions and changes to their clinical care routines due to COVID-19 shutdown and work-from-homeorders; survivors may experience delays in cancer treatment and follow-up care. Thus, racial/ethnic minorityand underserved cancer survivors who also have co-occurring chronic conditions represent the 'perfect storm'of risk factors for significant impacts on health outcomes as well as increasing health disparities.With this supplement, we will examine the impact of COVID-19 on care for vulnerable cancer survivors withhigh clinical risk further exacerbated by multiple chronic conditions, who are predominantly racial/ethnicminorities, uninsured, and served by a safety-net health system. Our specific aims are:Aim 1: Assess the impact of COVID-19 on the overall health and wellbeing of cancer survivors. Using amixed-methods approach (patient surveys and semi-structured interviews), we will assess the COVID-19effect on patients' physical, emotional, and mental health, financial impact, and coping.Aim 2: Assess the impact of COVID-19 on cancer survivors' access to cancer and non-cancer treatment andhealthcare utilization. We will capture how the pandemic impacted the delivery of cancer care and otherhealthcare services in this integrated safety-net system. We will examine whether there were treatment delaysrelated to cancer or other co-morbidities, challenges accessing care during this time, and the quality of caredelivered. Additionally, we will document and quantify the nature of COVID-19 encounters among our cohortof complex cancer survivors, using electronic health record (EHR) data extraction and analysis.These aims directly leverage existing research methods from the parent R01, adding new covariates andpatient-reported data specific to the COVID-19 experience.

P23432,Outlining the Role of IgA in Memory Instruction,"Several times in human history, we faced sudden outbreaks of respiratory viruses that rapidly spread over the world before we could design broadly protective vaccines. Such was the case of the H1N1 influenza virus that killed 50 million people during the 1918 Spanish flu and SARS-CoV-2 that led to at least 5 million deaths during the current COVID-19 pandemics. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 elicit robust humoral immune responses, including production of virus-specific antibodies of the IgM, IgG, and IgA types. In particular, IgA plays a crucial role in protecting lung mucosal surfaces by neutralizing respiratory viruses and impeding their attachment to epithelial cells. Despite its protective role, current vaccines against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 fail to produce significant levels of IgA in the respiratory tract. Then, a deeper understanding of the biology of IgA+ cells during respiratory infection is of utmost interest. ORIgAMI is based on recent unexpected findings from my team showing that germinal center B cells expressing IgA are mostly recruited towards the long-lived plasma cell compartment rather than to the memory B cell one upon influenza infection. In this frame, we will determine if the IgA BCR biases cell fate by:   1-Imprinting germinal center B cells with specific transcriptional/epigenetic programs.  2-Favoring antigen extraction and recruitment of T cell help within germinal centers.  3-Enhancing downstream B cell signalling pathways.  To to this end, we will use influenza H1N1 virus as respiratory infection model combined with a series of complementary innovative tools and methodologies: de novo-generated transgenic mice, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, 3D imaging, DNA-based force sensors, phospho- and imaging- flow cytometry, and mass-spectrometry.

C19853,The South Asian Birth Cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic: understanding the impact on children and families,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to negative health consequences for children and families including poor mental health and negative impacts to health behaviours. Given emerging evidence that racialized groups such as South Asians experienced greater COVID-19 burdens in other areas (e.g., infection rates, loss of income, mortality), it is important to examine the differences in impacts of the pandemic on racialized families. This project represents a unique opportunity to gather essential information about the health of South Asian families and children living in one of Canada's COVID-19 hotspots. We will do this by contacting families from the South Asian Birth cohort (START) study. This is a study of South Asian children and families living in Ontario, Canada. The study collects information at regularly spaced intervals over many years to help understand how diseases such as diabetes and heart disease begin.  The information collected for this project will help us answer three important questions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on South Asian children and families: 1) What is the impact on the mental health of South Asian children and parents as measured with, and compared to, the Ontario Parent Survey? 2) What are changes in health-related behaviours (e.g., diet, physical activity, screen time and sleep) compared to the previous measures of these behaviours in the START cohort? 3) How are the experiences, facilitators, and barriers to health and wellbeing through the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery efforts encountered by South Asian families? All of this information will enable us to understand  the range of mental health and health behaviour changes among South Asian children in Canada and the contributing factors essential to support equitable and community-led strategies which will be key to recovery.",10,10a

P23392,Supporting a tool for tracking and prioritizing global research funding for pandemic preparedness and response,"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant problems with traditional funding and research structures in a pandemic response context, leading to slow research activation and duplicate efforts globally. The urgency and scale of research needs have been difficult to respond to and coordinate. Further, the global distribution of COVID-19 research funding and activities has been uneven, with the majority of research projects taking place in high-income countries despite the heavy health and socio-economic burden that the pandemic has placed on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).    The need to map research funding to global and regional prioritization strategies was identified early in the pandemic. A COVID-19 Research Coordination and Learning Initiative (COVID CIRCLE) was established to align and strengthen research response in, with and for LMICs. A key success of COVID CIRCLE was the COVID-19 Research Project Tracker, a live database of funded COVID-19 research projects that aim to help funders and researchers identify gaps and opportunities and inform future research investments or coordination needs.     Building on that success, this new project seeks to develop and run a tool and associated analytical capability on global funding data for a wide range of epidemic-prone diseases and broader epidemic and pandemic research preparedness activities on an ongoing basis. This will support coordination of research preparedness and research responses during new epidemics, especially across LMICs.",13,
P22052,Enhanced susceptibility to Zika virus during pregnancy: a role for maternal dengue antibodies,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is closely related to dengue virus (DENV). Since its discovery in 1947, ZIKV remained relatively unnoticed, causing small, local outbreaks primarily in parts of Africa and Asia, and was associated with minor symptoms, such as mild fever. However, in the last decade, ZIKV started to spread geographically across the Pacific islands, eventually reaching South America, where it caused an explosive outbreak that started in Brazil in 2015 and rapidly spread to other South and Central American countries. This has been accompanied by a startling link between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the development of birth defects among fetuses and babies, including microcephaly. It is unclear what factors may have led to the massive ZIKV outbreak or the severe disease manifestations in the Americas, but one potential variable is that much of the at-risk population in the Americas has preexisting immunity to DENV. It is well documented that preexisting immunity to one serotype of DENV can alter the disease pathogenesis of a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Because ZIKV outbreaks have occurred in regions around the world where DENV is endemic and due to the high degree of relatedness of ZIKV and DENV, it is critical to understand and characterize the extent to which prior infection with DENV exacerbates ZIKV disease. In this application, we will focus on how DENV antibodies impact ZIKV infection in the context of pregnancy by utilizing three model systems (immunocompromised Stat2-/- mice, immunocompetent humanized STAT2 knock-in mice, and human placental explants infected with ZIKV ex vivo).","1, 4","1b, 1d, 4b"

Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences improve our understanding of host reservoir species, assess the potential for transmission to humans, and illuminate evolutionary dynamics relative to other viruses in Coronaviridae, informing response to current and future epidemics. We will study the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to investigate if particular motifs are under selection for increased virulence and immune evasion. We will compare SARS-CoV-2 with genomes of other zoonotic coronaviruses to elucidate common genomic features associated with virulence, host switching, and human-to-human transmission. We will also evaluate spatiotemporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 across different populations using Bayesian phylogeographic analyses. Such analyses allow identification of spatially and temporally structured, clinical and epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number, period of infectiousness, and true viral prevalence over time within different populations. We will also elucidate the reservoir host species of SARS-CoV-2 in concert with collaborators from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control as well as other Canadian researchers by probing unique environmental samples as well as both novel and existing datasets available for coronaviruses. Phylogenetic co-speciation analysis will explore whether coronaviruses are more likely to jump between phylogenetically proximate host species allowing development of a predictive framework to anticipate future zoonotic events. We will identify genomic factors of SARS-CoV-2 associated with virulence, estimate vital epidemiological parameters, and illuminate potential reservoir species. With the Chinese CDC, we will help focus the response, control and elimination of the current, and future, coronavirus outbreaks.","1, 2, 3","1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 3a"

The dramatic evolution of this pandemic in the regions of the world best prepared for such a situation makes the African continent fear an uncertain prospect. The African continent currently presents extremely fragmented data, which does not allow defining the state of the epidemic on the continent. Without this information, it is and will be difficult, if not impossible, to develop appropriate strategies and responses to prevent, contain and eliminate the pandemic on the continent.  The main objective of this study is to contribute to the development of new surveillance strategies, more suited to the context of the resource-limited settings as Sub-Saharan Africa and to model the state and progression of the epidemic in the region using these data. Data on the proportion of circulating specific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in the communities will be of particular importance.

C19685,How do perceptions of Covid-19 risk influence health decisions in pregnancy? A mixed methods study,"Pregnant people have experienced many difficult circumstances during the Covid-19 pandemic, which likely affected the way they made and enacted health decisions. We know that pregnant people have a higher risk of severe Covid-19 disease than non-pregnant people, resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and death.  Additionally, the well-being of women has been affected by policies designed to prevent and control Covid-19 infection, which have resulted in higher rates of intimate partner violence, mental health distress, employment loss and increased childcare responsibilities.   This research seeks to understand how these circumstances have changed the health decisions of pregnant people. Health decisions during pregnancy are particularly important because they have longitudinal effects on the health of the child and family.  We will use administrative health data from Ontario and BC to examine how vaccination, prenatal care and place of birth, and mental health have changed between people pregnant before and during the pandemic. We will conduct qualitative interviews with people pregnant during the pandemic to understand why and how their perceptions of Covid-19 risk influenced their health decisions. For example, how did they balance need for social connection and support with Covid-19 risk precautions about physical distancing and limiting contacts outside the household?  By combining these two types of data together, we will be able to describe changes and offer explanations for those changes. This new knowledge will help inform public health policy and clinical counselling decisions as the Covid-19 pandemic continues and in the future.","9,10","9a, 10a"

Their access to vital information has been reduced due to the 1) lack of sign language interpreting, 2) use of face-masks and 3) use of written texts above their reading level. Furthermore, remote working increases the cognitive fatigue in deaf people because they need to look at small videos of interpreters and increase the amount of reading.  We also aim to identify which of the compensatory measures to address information deficits that have originated within the Deaf community have been consulted and relied on.

C01000,Development of a High-Throughput Microfluidics-Enabled Functional Assay for Rapidly Identifying Neutralizing Antibodies,"ABSTRACT Viral pathogenesis kills 100 million people each year. However, broadly neutralizing antibodies (Abs) pro-duced by B lymphocytes in fortunate hosts routinely eliminates the threat of the most lethal viruses. Identifyingthe antigenic epitopes that can induce such neutralizing Abs (nAbs) via immunization is at best protracted andfraught with technical challenges, if possible at all. We are developing a novel, microfluidic, lab-on-a-chip tech-nology to radically speed the ability to functionally assay the neutralization capability of clonal Ab produced byone human B cell. PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated mi-crofluidics ENabled Technology) is a high-throughput, single-cell resolution platform that can measure the neu-tralization capability of the Abs produced by single B lymphocytes through a direct functional assay in a dropletmicrofluidics format. Thus, it provides an unbiased, single-cell resolution, high-throughput, near-complete anal-ysis of the entire B cell repertoire to identify B cells that neutralize viral infection. As influenza sometimes causes one half million deaths per year and we have a battery of tools and rea-gents already developed for this pathosystem, we have chosen it as the viral model in which to test our centralhypothesis that PRESCIENT will deliver a fast and low cost route for discovering neutralizing Abs (nAbs). Wewill take a tripartite approach with these aims: 1) to optimize the performance of the device with greater reliabil-ity, throughput and efficiency, 2) to quantitatively assess PRESCIENT's ability to recognize hybridomas thatmake nAbs against H1N1 influenza from progressively more rigorous mixed populations, and 3) to rapidly iden-tify nAbs against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza from EBV-immortalized human peripheral blood B cells. Phage and other display systems commonly used for nAb discovery have inherent bias and protein produc-tion hurdles due to non-mammalian post-translational modifications, thus direct utilization of B cells is ideal.Droplet microfluidic systems, where pico-liter scale water-in-oil emulsion droplets function as independent bio-reactors, can efficiently manipulate cells with unprecedented speed and precision. Droplet microfluidic systemsfor screening Abs produced from hybridomas that inhibit specific biochemical reactions have been described.However, systems that integrate Ab screening and viral neutralization bioassays have not yet been achieved.The major innovation is the development and utilization of the first high-throughput system for the functionaldiscovery of human nAbs against infectious agents, a truly vertical leap for the fields of vaccinology, immuno-therapeutic design and epitope discovery. With PRESCIENT, immunologists will be able to rapidly identify froma convalescent patient's blood draw the ""needle in the haystack"" paratope that generates life-saving broadlyneutralizing Abs. Ultimately, the unique immunoglobulin heavy and light chain DNA rearrangements will be iso-lated from the PRESCIENT-sorted cell for monoclonal Ab production or structural vaccine epitope engineering.1",1,"1a, 1d"
P23357,Support project in response to the effects of COVID-19 in the livestock sector in West and Central Africa (COVID-19-Agriculture and Food Security),"IDRC'Äôs response to the COVID-19 crisis includes a rapid response to the food and nutritional security crisis associated with COVID-19. This response mechanism supports the development of new, short-term activities that supplement existing projects. The goals are to document the impact of the pandemic (and control measures) on local food systems and food security; to document planned and spontaneous responses to the emerging crisis; and to strengthen responses to the current crisis. The rapid response mechanism also supports the development of new projects that document and analyze the efficacy of those responses. This will help low- and middle-income countries respond more efficiently to subsequent waves of the epidemic and to potential future shocks.     In West and Central Africa, COVID-19-related restrictions on movement within and between countries is affecting food availability and exacerbating the risk of food shortages. Agro-pastoral family farms are among those most heavily affected by these restrictions because they are confined to areas with poor foraging, which drastically reduces the performance of the herd. Governments have proposed measures for the benefit of pastoralists, raising several questions that will be addressed within the framework of this project.

There is urgent need for easy-to- operate and rapidly deployable diagnostic tools that can handle blood samples in a closed sample-to-answer manner. Here, we propose to develop a novel diagnostic technology that can detect viral antigens in an inexpensive, ultrasensitive, specific, and multiplexed manner. We will develop our novel approach into standalone tool with a detection capability at attomolar sensitivities (comparable to nucleic acid amplification tests) to diagnose arboviral infections with minimal user interference. The integrated diagnostic platform will utilize a novel surrogate approach, microfluidic integration, and a multiplexed detection scheme with the capacity to distinguish arboviral infections. The system will be designed to initiate diagnosis from serum/plasma/blood and provide a sample-to-answer diagnostic within less than 35 minutes using less than 100 Ã'ÂµL blood samples at a cost of $2 per test.

However, their place in response mechanisms to the COVID-19 pandemic at global (WHO), regional (Africa CDC) or national level seems more limited. Since the first cases, different community mobilizations have appeared in Senegal (where the initiative generally comes from the State) and in Burkina Faso (where the CBOs have carried out numerous health initiatives), these countries also differentiating themselves by their experience of the Ebola epidemic. Community mobilizations against COVID-19 must be documented and analyzed to understand their potential contribution (and their limits) to all the pillars of COVID19 response.  OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this operational research project is to strengthen the response against COVID-19 by documenting and analyzing community mobilizations and their socio-health challenges in Senegal and Burkina Faso.  The secondary objectives are to describe and compare:   Individual and collective community reconfigurations linked to COVID-19   The impact of COVID-19 and response measures on community actors (agents and organizations) and their adaptation   The models of mobilization and areas of involvement of CBOs, their achievements and limits   The interventions of community actors in / with the healthcare system  METHOD  After a situational analysis, the qualitative approach will combine interviews, observations and document analyzes with community actors, CBOs, health actors and people affected by COVID-19.

To do this, there is a new national consortium called the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics (CanCOGeN) network to determine the genetic code of the viruses infecting Canadians. Most changes in viral sequence will serve as markers but won't affect the virulence or transmission of the virus. However, some mutations will change how the virus causes disease, transmits or responds to antivirals and vaccines.  We have isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the high containment laboratory at the University of Toronto.

C10718,Quality of Death in Hospital and Bereavement Outcomes in the COVID-19 Era,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and its control measures have changed how people die and how their families grieve. Strict visitor policies in hospitals, restrictions on post-death ceremonies (e.g., funerals), social isolation and lack of access to professional support may have significant negative effects on the quality of death (QOD) of individuals dying during the pandemic and put their family members at risk of experiencing severe grief reactions. It is important to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people die and grieve because this can help improve the support services that are available to families at their most vulnerable time.   Aim: This 2-year study will recruit bereaved family members of individuals who died of any cause in two hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, in order to evaluate: i) the QOD and bereavement outcomes (depression, post-traumatic stress and complicated grief) and who is at a greater risk for worse QOD and more severe grief reactions; and ii) the experience and perceived met and unmet support needs of bereaved family members.   Methods: Six months after the patient death, family members of patients who died at the University Health Network or Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre will be asked to complete surveys of the patient's QOD, their satisfaction with and access to care, depression, post-traumatic stress and grief reactions. Participants will also be interviewed about their experience of death and grief.

In the UK, the trial is a collaboration between Exeter Medical School's Clinical Trials Unit and the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) in Melbourne, Australia. Professor John Campbell, Professor of General Practice and Primary Care here in University of Exeter is the principal investigator in the UK for the BRACE trial, with Professor Adilia Warris, Co-Director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology and Professor in Paediatric Infectious Diseases, as deputy principal investigator.",4,4c
C07117,"eMERGE SARS-CoV-2 Supplement: Pulmonary, renal, and inflammatory components","Abstract: As of May 4, 2020, more than 3.5M cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) and 250,000 deaths have been reported worldwide, with more than 1.2M cases and over 70,000 deaths in the United States. The severity of infection varies from no symptoms to respiratory failure and death.     Genetic factors appear to underlie some interindividual variability in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Part of this heritability may be associated with host immune response, as lymphocyte measures at hospital admission predict disease severity. It may be may also be important to understand whether an individual's underlying or ""baseline"" lymphocyte count is a risk factor for infection and/or severe disease; a multiancestrypolygenic risk score for lymphocytes will be tested for its prediction of COVID-19 severity to address this hypothesis.     This supplemental project will improve   1) standardization of electronic health record phenotyping of the pulmonary and renal complications of COVID-19 to improve transferability across sites; and   2) our understanding of host genetic risk factors playing a role in disease severity.     We propose to work within the aimsof eMERGE4 to study interindividual variability in COVID-19 severity by developing transferable EHRphenotyping of pulmonary and renal outcomes, evaluating ABO blood group association and GWAS contrasting those COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure (inpatient) with those who remained outpatients, and evaluating whether a multi-ancestry PRS for lymphocytes predicts COVID severity. This project can stand on its own, but we will gain power by pooling data across eMERGE and benefit by testing EHR phenotyping at multiple sites to assure transferability. We will also broadly share any data.",4,"4a, 4b"
P21287,Antibody discovery for neglected tropical and emerging infectious diseases,"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies are now routinely used as cancer therapies and immunosuppressants. Many mAbs licensed today are so-called 'blockbuster' therapies, with the majority of the Top 10 best-selling therapeutic drugs being mAbs. Until recently, mAbs for infectious diseases have largely lagged behind those for cancer and immunotherapies. However, the increase in demand for therapies, and spurred on by the recent covid pandemic, has led to substantial investments and advances in optimised manufacturing and reducing production costs. As such, there is increasing appetite for investing and developing mAbs for infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and those which predominantly affect LMICs. Using LSTM's and Lancaster University's unique resources, this project will be focused on the development of mAbs for a range of neglected tropical diseases, such as snakebite envenoming and recently emerging infectious diseases including pox viruses (for example, mpox).",6,6a
P21621,"PANDAA for universal, pan-lineage molecular detection of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus","Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease with high mortality rates in humans and high  outbreak potential. Found in 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa, CCHF has an extremely widespread and  growing range. Its causative agent, CCHF virus (CCHFV), is listed among the urgently concerning pathogens  prioritized in the WHO R&D Blueprint. With at least seven regional clades, CCHFV detection by gold standard qPCR-  based methods has been encumbered by significant strain-associated genetic variability. Existing tests for CCHFV  are often limited to regional use, presenting a barrier to standardization and quality assurance. The WHO has called  for the development of universal CCHFV diagnostics as a global priority. Aldatu Biosciences has pioneered the use  of PANDAA technology, which enables probe-based qPCR for target detection in highly variable genomic regions by  simultaneously adapting and amplifying diverse templates. PANDAA uniquely mitigates the presence of target-  proximal polymorphisms to allow otherwise divergent templates to be detected with consensus fluorescent probes  with similar sensitivities. As such, PANDAA-enabled qPCR is an ideal solution for universal detection of pathogens  with significant strain, lineage, and/or sub-type sequence diversity. Aldatu Biosciences is uniquely positioned to  deliver a rapid pan-lineage qPCR-based CCHFV diagnostic. PANDAA has been successfully applied to subtype-  independent detection of more than fifteen drug resistance mutation (DRM) targets in HIV. Recently, we completed  development of the first pan-lineage assay for Lassa fever virus (LASV), another WHO priority pathogen with high  outbreak potential. We propose to leverage the unique capabilities of PANDAA to develop a rapid, sensitive  molecular diagnostic assay for CCHFV detection, and the first with pan-lineage coverage, through the following  specific aims: (1) development of a pan-lineage PANDAA-CCHFV assay, leveraging proven techniques and  proprietary PANDAA reagent design; (2) analytical validation of the PANDAA-CCHFV assay, including confirmation  of clade inclusivity and high specificity; (3) thermostabilization of the PANDAA-CCHFV assay, in order to meet the  requirements of diagnostics targeted to LMICs; (4) clinical validation of the lyophilized PANDAA-CCHFV assay, using  clinical samples representing a broad variety of circulating clades and geographies; and (5) multi-site evaluation of  the PANDAA qDx CCHFV test kit at reference labs at CDC- and WHO-affiliated partner institutions. As the first pan-  lineage assay, PANDAA-CCHFV will provide a rapid, standardized testing option for all regions within the broad  range of CCHFV. This novel, pan-lineage detection assay could ultimately be deployed in any endemic region on  pre-existing qPCR equipment in central labs, and/or integrated into a closed, point-of-care system with sample  processing to radically improve the CCHFV diagnostic workflow.",1,1a

With changes to the availability, delivery format, and accessibility of MHA services as a result of the pandemic, families of youth in need of MHA care may be experiencing considerable difficulties finding and connecting with appropriate supports. This project will explore the MHA needs of Ontario youth and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of 5000 Ontarians will be conducted in October, 2021. This survey is a third round of two prior surveys conducted in July, 2020, and February, 2021. The survey will identify and measure the MHA concerns, service needs and preferences, and experiences in the pandemic in relation to MHA concerns and demographics, for youth and caregivers. Survey findings from Round 3 will be explored in relation to findings from Rounds 1 and 2, to examine how youth and families' MHA needs and service preferences have evolved over the course of the pandemic. These findings will also be combined with an existing dataset of approximately 180 in-depth, one-on-one qualitative interviews, conducted with caregivers of youth with MHA concerns over the course of the pandemic. These interviews focused on caregivers' and their youth's MHA concerns, effects of the pandemic on their and their youth's MHA concerns, as well as their experiences of finding and accessing MHA care during the pandemic. This work will provide crucial information regarding the impacts of changes in access services to youth and families' existing MHA service preferences and needs. The findings will provide important information to design services and systems that transform MHA care across Ontario and Canada in response to the pandemic and in the future.",10,10a
C03627,"Fighting pandemics with enhanced risk communication: Messages, compliance and vulnerability during the COVID-19 outbreak","The PAN-FIGHT project will investigate political and social dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, by addressing health risk communication in relation to social and cultural dynamics. We will offer new knowledge on how national and local authorities as well as health institutions can enhance their risk communication to mitigate social vulnerabilities. In so doing, we will contribute to improved preparedness, resilience and societal safety.     The COVID-19 pandemic provide an unprecedented opportunity for governments, researchers, health systems and the population at large to assess their resilience and improve preparedness. Future pandemic pathogens can be much more sinister. Of paramount interest in this context is how national and local authorities communicate with their citizens about risks associated with the COVID-19 virus. National and local variations in risk communication appear to have triggered similarly varied reactions in the general public, with subsequent impact on vulnerabilities conditioned by social and cultural differences.     Bringing together some of Europe and the United States' most competent researchers on risk communication, societal safety and health emergencies, this project will   a) investigate to what extent national variations in authorities' risk communication strategies can be linked to the ways in which members of the public adhere to governmental guidelines, requirements and restrictions;   b) identify any correlations between risk communication, adherence, and factors such as social capital, age, gender, socio-economic status and household composition; and   c) translate this knowledge into internationally aligned, evidence-based, and culturally sensitive risk communication strategies.     The greatest risk to this project is the COVID-19 pandemic itself, with unpredictable health effects on those involved and possible prolonged restrictions on mobility and personal contact. We will counteract the latter with a robust digital infrastructure.",9,9c

It will engage beach management units, technological institutions, women'Äôs groups, the private sector, and policymakers to study, co-design, and deploy model IMTA farms, and use them as platforms to gain practical insights. It will promote knowledge translation, dissemination, and learning for IMTA systems upscaling, climate change, and COVID-19 response strategies for the local community in Kwale and Kilifi counties, as well as other coastal communities in Kenya.","9, 10","9a, 9b, 10c"
C03953,The effects of exposure to violence on risk for substance abuse:  neural mechanisms and community level moderators,"Project SummaryIt is well known that stressful events, such as those occurring as a result of COVID-19 prevention efforts, are apotent trigger for the initiation and escalation of illicit substance use. However, it is not well known how stresstriggers increased substance use, which could help improve understanding, prevention, and treatment ofsubstance use disorders. Therefore, our ongoing longitudinal study of adolescents was designed to test thehypothesis that stress during development recalibrates the neural processes underlying threat and rewardreactivity as well as working memory capacity, which leads to increased risk for the initiation and escalation ofsubstance use. Because COVID-19 related social distancing is a profound stressor, measuring it's effectsprovides an opportunity to better understand these hypothesized pathways by which stress increasessubstance use. Therefore, we propose to recontact adolescents (n=309) and caregivers (n=246) in ourongoing longitudinal study to assess changes in stress, cognitive function, and substance use due to theCOVID-19 pandemic at two time points. At both time points, youths will also complete a working memorycapacity task and delay discounting assessment and have their locations tracked with GPS for a week whilethey receive 35 ecological momentary assessment (EMA) prompts to assess their momentary stress, socialinteractions, substance use, and feelings at particular locations as was done in prior waves. In Aim 1, we focuson 3 particular categories of stress to understand their relative contribution to increased substance use: (1)Social distancing experiences: the GPS and questionnaire assessments of activity patterns provide aquantitative, state-of-the-art measure of the magnitude of change in individual mobility elicited by COVID-19social distancing; (2) Economic hardship: Because our sample is socioeconomically diverse (37.4% haveannual household incomes under $30,000), we will have the opportunity to clarify the effects of increasedeconomic challenges on substance use; (3) Social isolation and conflict: The questionnaire and EMA data onfrequency of interpersonal interaction and conflict provide the opportunity to determine if these are also triggersof increased substance use. In Aim 2, potential cognitive mediators of these effects will be assessed using themeasurement of working memory capacity and delay discounting. These youths have already completed aneuroimaging session that assessed neural structure (anatomy and connectivity), resting state activity, andactivity during tasks probing working memory capacity (Emotional N-Back), reward reactivity (viewing imagesof marijuana, e-cigs, and alcohol), reward anticipation (Monetary Incentive Delay), and threat reactivity(emotional faces). Because these same procedures will be repeated as soon as research activity can resumeafter COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, Aim 3 will be to determine how COVID-19 related stress moderateschanges in neural structure and function as well as the degree to which these neural changes predict changesin substance use.",10,"10a, 10b, 10c"

P21694,Ebola virus infection of the female reproductive system,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Ebola virus (family Filoviridae) is the causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD), which is characterized by  hemorrhagic fever in humans, reaching high mortality rates (Ã¢Â‰Â¥40%). Sexual transmission of Ebola virus from a  male survivor to a woman was first documented during the large 2014-2016 West African outbreak. Then this  route of infection was reported to be likely responsible for multiple EBOV outbreak flare-ups between 2015 and  2016. Infectivity of the semen of survivors was later documented for at least 179 days after the onset of disease.  Mathematical modelling of the contribution of sexual behavior in virus transmission during that same outbreak  showed that abstinence, along with infectious patient isolation, could stop an outbreak. As of June 2nd, 2020, the  on-going EBOV outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo describes 3463 cases with 2280 deaths, and  there are no data available as to which route of infection is primarily responsible of transmission and the  situational awareness of survivors to spread EVD. Recently, our group demonstrated that human vaginal  epithelial cells are susceptible to infection with Ebola virus, support productive viral replication resulting in a  robust proinflammatory response. Furthermore, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of the vaginal Polyphenylene  Carboxymethylene (PPCM) microbicide as a countermeasure and could show suppression of virus replication  and virus-induced inflammatory response in these cells. Altogether, these facts support the critical need to  develop new experimental models for this route of infection and therapeutics preventing virus transmission during  unprotected sexual intercourse.  Our long-term goal is to better understand sexual transmission of Ebola virus, and to identify prophylactic  methods other than condoms. The objective in this proposal is to investigate Ebola virus pathogenesis in women  following sexual transmission using a relevant in-vitro model of the human female reproductive system as well  as a susceptible mouse model. Our central hypothesis is that the human female reproductive system is  susceptible to Ebola virus infection leading to atypical clinical manifestations of EVD and laboratory  characteristics compared to those observed after infection by Ebola virus using other more documented routes  of infection. To interrogate our driving hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Characterize  Ebola virus infection and inflammation in-vitro using a model of the human vaginal epithelium cultured  at air-liquid interface, (2) Establish an in-vivo model of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) following intravaginal  virus challenge, and (3) Evaluate the protective antiviral efficacy of PPCM in-vitro and in-vivo. The  proposed studies will develop novel models for research of filovirus pathogenicity and further develop PPCM as  a microbicide for Ebola virus infection.","1, 4, 6","1b, 1e, 4b, 6a"
P23496,Circular RNAs to reverse pathological remodelling of the injured heart,"Heart failure (HF) is a most common cause of mortality with currently >60 million of affected patients. Numbers will increase due to socioeconomic factors and as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic. A major underlying cause of HF are cardiac remodelling processes at the molecular, cellular and tissue level. We will here focus on noncoding circular RNAs (circRNA) involved in two distinct forms of cardiac injury, chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and SARS-CoV-2-infection, where currently no specific treatment strategies are available to reverse disease pathology. First proof-of-concept studies targeting the cardiac remodelling process by noncoding RNA modulation have been pioneered by us and were recently tested in a world-wide first clinical phase 1b study in HF patients. Within the family of non-coding RNAs, circRNAs are stable and species-conserved and thus ideal drug targets. We discovered multiple molecular circRNA signatures during remodelling of cardiac cells and tissues from mice and patients. We now aim to lift our research to its next inflection point with the following steps and interconnected objectives: a) discover key functional circular RNAs involved in remodelling processes by functional CRISPR-Cas library screening; b) validate circRNAs by manipulating human living beating myocardial tissue, c) explore their mode of action; and d) perform targeted cardiac delivery approaches of selected candidates in both chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiac disease models. A combination of bioinformatic, molecular and physiology-based methods, unique established noncoding RNA drug discovery pipelines, availability of modern S3-safety labs, large clinical biobanks and (fresh) human cardiac tissue for slicing preparations form the basis for a successful strategy. REVERSE aims to discover fundamentally new therapeutic entry points for two forms of cardiac injuries, where currently no disease-specific treatments are available.","1, 4","1b, 4b, 4d"

We propose to carry out a two-year global prospective study that will enroll and follow-up children with suspected COVID-19 from 50 participating emergency departments (ED) across 19 countries. Patient epidemiological and demographic information, clinical characteristics, and disease outcomes, will be collected at the time of ED admission, during the course of illness, and at three weeks and three months after enrollment, using WHO-compliant case report forms. Statistical analysis of the collected data will allow for the identification of risk factors associated with children having confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and/or severe COVID-19 outcomes. In order to enable rapid implementation, this study will be built as a parallel study that borrows the infrastructure from an ongoing study - the called Pediatric Emergency Research Network (PERN)-Pneumonia study, which has ethics approval, a centralized database, data sharing agreements, and established study teams that are actively enrolling children in 70 sites worldwide. Our multidisciplinary team of investigators includes pediatric infectious disease and emergency medicine clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and public health leaders (from PHAC and the CDC), all with extensive experience pertaining directly to the research topic. As data will be shared in real-time with appropriate national and international authorities, this study will enable policymakers to make rapid evidence-based adaptations to case screening and management procedures that will then allow for the earlier identification of children at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, the establishment of this global multi-site study will be the first trial of a rapid PERN response to a novel virus, which, applying lessons-learned, can be urgently reactivated for future public health emergencies.","3, 4","3b, 4a, 4b"

P23019,A Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 system for conditional gene disruption in Aedes aegypti,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mosquito-borne disease is a major source of human misery, sickening hundreds of millions and killing  hundreds of thousands of people annually. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for the  viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya and other diseases. In addition to its medical importance, Ae.  aegypti is increasingly used for molecular genetic studies of mosquito vector biology. Understanding Ae.  aegypti biology will provide basic science insights into this mosquito vectorÃ¢Â€Â™s development, physiology and  behavior, help inform implementation of control efforts and potentially suggest new control strategies.  Improving approaches for genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti will facilitate these efforts.   To date, genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti often rely on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to  create strains of homozygous mutant animals in which a gene of interest has been disrupted. While extremely  valuable, substantial effort is required to create each mutant and the mutants obtained lack cell-specificity. To  address these limitations, we propose to establish a cell-specific, modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) toolkit for Ae.  aegypti. CmC is designed to decrease the effort required to examine the impact of disrupting a gene of interest,  allow the cells in which a gene is acting to be determined and aid the study of essential genes.  We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:  Aim #1: Introduce the tools for Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) into Ae. aegypti  In aim 1a, we design a strategy and build tools for creating mosquito strains that express modified Cas9  transgenes designed to allow optimization of Cas9 levels. In aim 1a2, we use these tools to create mosquitoes  that express modified Cas9 transgenes in a specific subset of sensory neurons. In aim 1b, we create transgenes  that express multiple gRNAs in a cell-specific fashion to specify the genes targeted.  Aim 2: Implement CmC in a subset of sensory neurons as well as pan-neuronally  In aim 2a, we test the system, using the tools built to identify an optimal strain which promotes robust cell-  specific gene disruption in a subset of sensory neurons, without causing cell death. In aim 2b, we construct  mosquito strains that will enable broad neuron-specific gene disruption, which should be of wide utility.",2,"2b, 2c"

This antiviral platform facilitates rapid, targeted SpongeBot development and deployment against SARS-CoV-2, its viral mutations, as well as entirely new viruses - providing a barrier to future viral pandemics.SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable and individuals can transmit the disease even prior to becomingsymptomatic, sharply increasing the rate of disease spread. During the first two weeks following infection, theinnate immune system attempts to slow down the rapidly multiplying pathogen to provide time for the adaptive immune system to develop more specific and effective mechanisms to destroy the virus. However, in individuals with decreased or compromised immune responses, the excessive viral load can lead to elevated inflammation,severe tissue damage, and ultimately death.SpongeBot, our bioengineered cell-based therapy solution, provides vital support to the body's immune system,through its genetically designed ability to sequester and destroy SARS-CoV-2 viral particles at sites of injury, inaddition to attenuation of the immune system's hyperinflammatory response to the virus. Administering SpongeBot cells to an infected individual reduces and keeps viral load below dangerous thresholds, prevents harmful hyperinflammation, and provides the adaptive immune system the time required to mount an effectivedefense against the virus.SpongeBot can be administered prophylactically to at-risk populations (e.g., healthcare workers, the elderly, orimmunocompromised individuals), or therapeutically at any stage during the course of viral infection. Importantly, SpongeBot therapy is extremely safe; the base technology has a long proven clinical safety track record.

P24933,Houston Methodist Research Institute - Disease X,"25 January 2024, OSLO Norway: The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is teaming up with leading scientists at the Houston Methodist Research Institute to further develop a promising type of disease-defence technology that could pave the way for new 'Äòcircular RNA'Äô vaccines that are more stable, durable and cost-effective.  With CEPI funding of up to $3.8 million, the Houston Methodist vaccinology team aims to advance its 'ÄòcircRNA'Äô platform, a high-impact innovation offering significant potential beyond mRNA vaccines in defending populations against future epidemic and pandemic disease threats. The project is focused on the design and preclinical evaluation of 'ÄòcircRNA'Äô vaccine candidates, initially against Chikungunya 'Äì a CEPI priority pathogen that is a member of the Togaviridae family 'Äì and aims to generate the data necessary to establish preclinical proof of concept for the vaccine platform.  RNA vaccine technology, which uses the body'Äôs own machinery to make antigenic protein rather than injecting an antigen into the recipient, has made significant progress in recent years. The most ground-breaking advance came with its validation for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was used to develop new vaccines in less than a year that went on to save millions of lives and reduce the number of severe cases of COVID-19.  While mRNA vaccines are now expected to play a crucial role in preventing and controlling future outbreaks and pandemics, they have some limitations 'Äì including the potential to provoke local reactions or short-term fever in people who receive them. Relative to other types of vaccine, they are currently expensive to manufacture and require costly and complex cold-chain storage and transportation infrastructure.  As the name suggests, circular RNA vaccine technology uses a closed-loop RNA, which could enable vaccine candidates based on it to be more stable and durable than current linear-based mRNA candidates. The technology could also deliver improved efficacy in smaller doses. HMRI'Äôs circRNA platform is still in the early-stages of development, but, if successful, it has the potential to be effective in single-dose regimens, to reduce the amount of RNA needed per dose and to lower the cost of RNA-based vaccines, which could altogether contribute to the accessibility of mRNA vaccines.  'ÄúDespite being once thought of as 'Äòmolecular junk'Äô, recent research has suggested that, with its stable looped structure, 'Äòcircular RNA'Äô could be harnessed for RNA-based medicines, like vaccines'Äù explains Dr In-Kyu-Yoon, Acting Executive Director of Vaccine R&D at CEPI.  'ÄúIf effective, these circRNA vaccines could progress this new scientific era of mRNA vaccinology even further, leveraging not only the speed at which the technology can be designed and tested in response to infectious disease outbreaks but also the potential to create more durable and accessible mRNA vaccines for greater global protection when faced with a deadly disease threat.'Äù  CEPI'Äôs investment in HMRI is the latest in its programme to advance novel RNA vaccine platform technologies for emerging and select endemic infectious diseases. The programme aims to evaluate whether the next-generation of RNA technologies could offer substantial advantages over existing mRNA platforms, for example improved immunogenicity, storage, stability, productivity, response time, and cost-of-goods. Improvements to rapid response mRNA technologies may contribute to the 100 Days Mission, a goal backed by leaders of the G7 and G20, to compress vaccine development timelines to 100 days.  'ÄúWe are excited to be working with CEPI on the development of circular RNA vaccine technology to protect the world against emerging viral threats,'Äù said H. Dirk Sostman, M.D. President and CEO of the Houston Methodist Academic Institute.  'ÄúThis effort is led by Dr. John Cooke, director of our Center for RNA Therapeutics, with a team of innovative scientists including Drs. Dan Kiss, Jimmy Gollihar, Kristopher Brannan and Francesca Taraballi, together with our colleagues at University of Texas Medical Branch.  Houston Methodist is leading medicine by generating fundamental scientific insights that have transformational effects on human health.'Äù   Enabling equitable access to vaccines  CEPI and HMRI are committed to enabling equitable access to the outputs of this CEPI-supported programme, in line with CEPI'Äôs Equitable Access Policy. This ultimately includes commitment to vaccines being available first to populations at risk when and where they are needed at an affordable price should a related vaccine be developed further using CEPI funding. Project results including data generated as part of this project will be published open access for the benefit of the global scientific community.  'ÄìENDS'Äì   About CEPI  CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic threats so they can be accessible to all people in need.  CEPI has supported the development of over 30 vaccine candidates against its priority pathogens'ÄîChikungunya virus, Ebola Virus Disease, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and SARS-CoV-2'Äîand is a leading funder of research into broadly protective coronavirus vaccines, which could protect against future variants of COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential. The organization has also invested in the development of rapid response platforms to develop vaccines against Disease X (the threat of an unknown virus).  CEPI has contributed to a number of scientific breakthroughs, including the first ever licensed Chikungunya vaccine and the advancement of the first ever Nipah and Lassa vaccines into Phase 1 trials. The organization played a central role in the global response to COVID-19, supporting the development of one of the world'Äôs largest portfolios of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, seven of which have been approved for domestic or global use. It also co-led COVAX, the global initiative to deliver fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, which has delivered approximately 2 billion doses of vaccine to 146 countries around the world.  CEPI'Äôs five-year plan for 2022-2026 aims to dramatically reduce or even eliminate the future risk of pandemics and epidemics. Central to the plan is CEPI'Äôs goal to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days. Achieving this 'Äò100 Days Mission,'Äô which has been embraced by the G7 and G20, would give the world a fighting chance of containing a future outbreak before it can spread to become a global pandemic.

C06720,The National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network:  New England Consortium Node,"PROJECT Summary: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses unique threats to individuals with opioid usedisorder (OUD).1,2 They are likely to be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and the public health measures(i.e., social distancing) to control the disease.3,4 Specifically, individuals with OUD in remission may be atsubstantial risk for return to opioid use given disruptions in addiction treatment, such as medications for OUD(MOUD). In addition, stress due to social distancing, finances, loss of employment or housing may be a triggerfor return to use. COVID-19 may result in changes in illicit opioid supply and diverted buprenorphine andmethadone as programs and clinicians follow federal recommendations and provide patients with more takehome doses of methadone (increasing risk for overdose and diversion) and longer prescriptions ofbuprenorphine. Separately, there is concern that OUD-related stigma, lack of usual source of care, andpotential consequences of a positive test (e.g., housing situation), individuals with OUD may be less likely toseek a COVID-19 test even when clinically recommended. Importantly, all of these factors may vary widelybased on geography. To provide urgent insights on the potential impact of COVID-19 on individuals with OUDin four US cities, and informed by prior research,5,6 we will leverage the >700 patients enrolled in Project ED-Health (CTN-0069) and research infrastructure7 to reach individuals with OUD. Specifically, we will attempt tocontact all 738 individuals who were enrolled in Project ED-Health, at one of our four participating emergencydepartments (ED) located in New York, NY; Baltimore, MD; Seattle, WA; and Cincinnati, OH, to participate in afollow-up one time telephone-based survey. We will collect self-reported data on the impact of the COVID-19epidemic on opioid use and treatment and COVID-19 symptoms and testing. We will triangulate these datawith an electronic survey of medical directors and site-Principal Investigators at each site to capture data onthe impact of COVID-19 on ED presentations and experiences of patients with OUD. This work will beconducted by a team of investigators that has robust experiences in developing and implementing surveys,8-12linking self-reported and electronic health record data,13-15 and conducting longitudinal research with individualswith OUD.16-20 Thus, among a geographically diverse (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, West Coast) sample ofindividuals with OUD, we seek to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on (Aim 1) OUDtreatment (engagement and access to MOUD), drug use, drug supply, and overdose risk, (Aim 2) COVID-19related symptoms and testing, and (Aim 3) ED leadership reports of the presentation of patients with OUD tothe ED, ED-based buprenorphine prescribing practices, and community treatment options. These timesensitive data are urgently needed to begin to understand the impact of COVID-19 among individuals withOUD to directly inform clinical interventions and policies.","10, 11","10a, 11e"

C15379,"Improving Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Awareness, Access, and Accountability in Underrepresented Communities","Abstract-Overall  This proposal is a competitive renewal of the IDeA Program Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research  (IDeA-CTR)(U54) grant originally awarded in September 2013. The program, titled the Delaware CTR ACCEL  Program, has thus currently completed four years of funding at the time of this application. The overall goal of the  ACCEL Program remains to provide the key components to allow growth in strategic areas to improve the health of  the citizens of Delaware and the nation. Our consortium currently consists of four partners: University of Delaware  (UD)-the lead institution; A.I. DuPont Hospital for Children, a part of the Nemours Children's Health System (Ne-  mours); Christiana Care Hospital System (CCHS), the largest health care sys-tem in the state of Delaware; and the  Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), our out-of-state IDeA partner. In this competitive renewal, we will  expand our consortium to include Delaware State University (DSU), an American historically black, public univer-  sity located in Dover, Delaware. Delaware is an ideal state for a CTR grant as it represents the whole of the USA in a  compact form. The population of Delaware (~950,000) mirrors the US population in urban-to-rural citizen ratio and  ethnic/racial diversity, with 22% African American, 69% Caucasian, 8% Hispanic, 3% Asian and 1% Native American.  The dominance of adult (CCHS) and pediatric (Nemours) hospital systems, which serve at least 85% of the residents  of the state, provides a unique opportunity to treat the state of Delaware as a model for examining how healthcare  changes can impact population health. Similar to the strong support the ACCEL Program currently enjoys, the part-  nering institutions and the State have again agreed to provide over $8.3 M in funds to support ACCEL related activi-  ties. The structure and activities of the ACCEL Program have been modified in this competitive renewal. The ACCEL  Program now only includes the Administrative Core and the five required key component activities. In addition,  based on lessons learned, opportunities discovered, and success achieved, we have made substantive exciting changes  to every component of the ACCEL Program. The Overall Specific Aims for the ACCEL Program are to: 1) Provide op-  portunities and infrastructure that enhance the ability of outstanding investigators to conduct exciting and impactful  clinical and translational research programs in areas of need and opportunity. 2) Recruit, train, and develop clini-  cians, scientists, and engineers who will develop innovative, competitive, interdisciplinary, and interinstitutional clin-  ical and translational research teams, and 3) Expand and enhance model community engagement outreach research  programs that work with the State and other stakeholders to promote health and wellness to a diverse population of  Delawareans.  The leadership of the ACCEL program is proud of the strong foundation we have created over the past four years  and looks forward to continuing to grow clinical and translational research programs that address some of the  most important health care needs of Delawareans and all Americans.","9, 11","9b, 11f"
P22615,Ecological immunology of a flea vector (Ctenocephalides felis),"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Fleas are obligate vectors of bacterial pathogens that cause severe diseases in humans, including murine typhus  and bubonic plague. To resist or limit infection, fleas possess an innate immune system that provides defense  against microbial invasion and colonization. However, in their natural habitats, flea populations are made up of  individuals that differ not only their genetic background, but also in regard to factors such as sex, age, diet,  infection history, gut microbiota, and exposure to environmental stressors. These non-genetic factors have been  shown to have important consequences on the outcome of infection in other disease vectors; yet, no studies to  date have addressed the impact of these ecological parameters on flea immune responses. The proposed  research aims to fill these knowledge gaps in flea ecological immunology, with the primary goals being to  determine the intrinsic factors that affect the antibacterial response in adults, and to determine the effect of larval  ecology on subsequent infections as adults. Specifically, we propose to compare the strength of immune defense  mechanisms in adult cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) based on sex, age, and infection history (Specific Aim 1),  as well as following larval exposure to food quantity, larval density, and insecticides (Specific Aim 2). This project  will provide valuable insight into the variability of flea immunity under natural conditions, which can directly affect  pathogen transmission dynamics and alter disease prevalence outcomes within a vector population. Data arising  from this project could aid in the development of novel strategies to control the spread of flea-borne pathogens  to humans.","1, 2","1b, 1d, 2a, 2b"
C10742,"Restricted family presence in the PICU during the COVID-19 pandemic: Understanding impact, experience, and stakeholder priorities","Family presence is essential to family centred care in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), where children have a high risk of death and disability. PICUs generally value and promote family presence. But to minimize COVID-19 spread, hospitals and PICUs implemented policies to restrict family presence. Our research team, consisting of healthcare providers (HCPs), families, patients, and policy-makers has been studying the policies and their impacts. We have found a lot of variability in the policies and evidence of harm to all stakeholders. We have not yet studied the impact on children. Before the next major threat to family presence and family centered care, we need input from patients, families, and HCPs on what is most important to them in family presence policies, what the impact of restrictions are, and what important outcomes of a family presence policy are.  In this study we will build on our existing work and use the situation of restricted family presence to frame a better understanding of family presence policies in general. We will interview pediatric PICU patients to better understand the impact and experience of these policies, and also which parts of a family presence policy are important to them. Next, we will hold focus groups with patients, families, HCPs, and administrators where we will work together to develop priorities for family presence policies, identify ways to improve or avoid the impact of restricted presence policies, and determine how to best assess these policies. Finally, we will hold a national stakeholder conference to create consensus statements on family presence in PICU.  All of our studies have been designed with Patient Partners and people in healthcare who will use the information, and we will exchange information with people affected by family presence policies throughout the studies. We will use national platforms to disseminate consensus statements and we will look for feedback from patients, families, and HCPs.","10, 11","10b, 11a"
C07407,Investigating SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in UK Jewish Communities,"This study, in a UK Jewish community, will investigate the role of children, cross-protection from non-SARS-CoV2 coronaviruses, asymptomatic transmission, household structure, and pre-existing conditions on transmission and burden of disease. This will generate strong evidence for major unknowns in infection natural history, and by using transmission models we can translate findings to improve UK projections of subsequent waves.    Uniquely this community has maintained community level records on treatment both within and outside the home for all members providing an unparalleled record of the impact of COVID-19 and combined with their highly-connected population structures and large inter-generational household structures make them an ideal case-study in understanding drivers of transmission in high-risk communities and in particular the role and/or risks associated with children.    We will undertake a cross-sectional survey enrolling 500 households. We will collect information on household structure, social mixing, evidence of COVID-19 and collect samples for serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 and HCOV infection. We will collect detailed data on community understanding and perceptions of risk and acceptability and feasibility of future control strategies such as vaccination.    We will use these data to fit a mathematical transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 and estimate risk of each transmission in different settings, such as households, schools, synagogues and yeshiva, which is critical as the community (and the country) exit lockdown. By analysing households, we will quantify transmission from children, by comparing the force of infection by household size and composition. This information is critical for re-opening of schools in the Autumn.","3, 9","3a, 3b, 9a"
P22298,Identification of Flavivirus Nucleocapsid Core-Envelope Glycoprotein Interactions,"Project Summary/Abstract   Flaviviruses (a family of over 90 known viruses, including Zika, dengue and West Nile) are significant  human pathogens affecting 3.1 billion people annually, and most of these enveloped viruses do not have any  viable vaccines or antivirals capable of combating their spread. The primary objective of current flavivirus antiviral  design is to disrupt specific mechanisms in the flavivirus life cycle that are key for virus survival, including virus  attachment to the host cell, viral endocytosis, genome uncoating, genome replication, and virus maturation  through the Golgi. These potentially druggable mechanisms have been explored in great detail both within our  lab and elsewhere. However, little is known about the assembly mechanisms that drive infectious virus particle  formation. Because of the high structural homology among all flaviviruses, the identification of assembly  mechanisms will provide ubiquitous targets for therapeutic intervention in virus proliferation.   In other enveloped virus systems, assembly depends on the interaction of virus core proteins with lipid  membranes or membrane bound glycoproteins to produce infectious virus particles. Exploration via single  particle Cryo-EM reconstruction has shown that the nucleocapsid core (NC) of immature Zika virus, is found in  close proximity with the envelope glycoproteins on the inner side of the virusÃ¢Â€Â™s lipid bilayer. Due to this close  proximity, I hypothesized that the NC interacts with the envelope glycoproteins during virus assembly. I further  hypothesized and that these interactions occur between the capsid protein (CP) and transmembrane helices of  the precursor membrane (prM) protein and the envelope (E) protein while the particle is in the immature state.  Since no information currently exists on virus assembly relying on CP-prM/E interactions, these interactions have  the potential to be exploited as new drug targets capable of inhibiting the proliferation of flaviviruses.   To this end, I am investigating two independent strategies to validate the hypothesized NC-prM/E  interactions using dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) as a model system. The Kuhn lab is particularly adept in  mutagenesis studies using DENV2, which is why the decision was made to use this virus as our model system  instead of Zika. Firstly, amino acids within the prM/E transmembrane helices that were posited to be key in the  assembly process of DENV2 and other flaviviruses have been or will be mutated to investigate their role in  promoting particle assembly. Secondly, the ability of the DENV2 prM and E transmembrane helices to interact  with CP is being examined through the use of reconstituted prM and E proteins within SMA lipid nanoparticles.  Due to the high similarity of all flaviviruses, the techniques, results and mechanisms identified in this study can  be applied to other flaviviruses. Combining these essential experimental studies with the proposed training skills  and collaborative opportunities for effective scientific communication through writing, speaking and mentoring  will prepare me well for a future in biomedical research.",1,1b

C07087,"Determination of mucosal immune responses to, and infection of the gastrointestinal tract by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)","PROJECT SUMMARYIn approximately 6 months, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by Severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in >6 million cases and led to >350K deathsworldwide, with over 100K of these deaths in the USA alone. Although the major pathologies leading to thesedeaths are cardiovascular and pulmonary in nature, COVID-19 is a multi-system disease and gastrointestinal(GI) symptoms are frequently reported. While animal studies and in-vitro experiments demonstrate thatenterocytes can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, analyses of the GI tract in humans have been limited to viralRNA detection in feces or suggestions of enteric inflammation as measured by elevated levels of fecalcalprotectin in a subset of patients. Being at the forefront of COVID-19 cases in New York City, we haverecruited a cohort of >60 individuals. With a strong collaborative infra-structure supported by the parent R01grant focusing on host-viral (HIV-1 associated) interactions in the GI tract, we are well-poised for detailedanalyses of intestinal tissues in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, as evidenced in the submitted application, wehave already generated a strong body of data, demonstrating for the first time, human enterocyte infection bySARS-CoV-2 that is in some cases associated with evidence of intestinal inflammation as measured by fecalcalprotectin and numerous fecal cytokines. We are in the process of determining how these inflammatoryresponses modulate SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses as measured by fecal IgA. The supplementaryfunds as requested will allow us to continue with the analyses of specimens that are already banked and willenable further recruitment of patients with active and convalescent COVID-19 disease. With the proposedstudies, we aim to a) further characterize infection of GI tissues; b) determine viral persistence in the gut duringconvalescence; and c) determine the generation and evolution of inflammatory and antigen-specific mucosalimmune responses. Altogether, through further development and analyses of this unique cohort, we aim toprovide important insights into the role played by the GI tract in COVID-19 pathogenesis and transmission.","1, 4","1d, 4b"
C01749,Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and impact of policy by modeling individual decisions of the general population,"social sciences - The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic leads to a worldwide threat of collapsing health care systems and large numbers of casualties. This necessitates a swift but appropriate response in terms of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent and control the infection. Currently, measures to restrict social contacts are the most important means of limiting the spread of the virus. These measures have economic, psychosocial and other detrimental consequences and need to be limited to the extent and duration that is absolutely necessary. Here, we propose a model that allows to estimate a projected effect of measures based on simulating the impact on individual persons and their behavior in a given environment, going beyond the current state of the art in epidemiologic models. A central improvement over conventional models is the inclusion of a fuzzy logic-based description of the decisions individuals take under the influence of restrictive measures, media reporting, and public communication of policy. By developing this model into a tool including a graphical user interface and parameterizing it based on local data, we provide an accessible way to simulate the impact of policy decisions and inform and guide political and administrative decision processes.","3, 9","3c, 9e"

Many settings also limited movement of residents within homes. These restrictions were a logical approach to attempt to limit spread of the virus; however, they had serious consequences for the health, well-being, function and autonomy of older adult residents, and important implications for family members and staff in the facilities; these consequences have not been methodically examined.   Objectives and methods: Using quantitative and qualitative methods we will 1) conduct a survey to detail and categorize levels of pandemic restrictions in LTC and retirement homes across Ontario; 2) use mobile device data to explore actual movement patterns in these settings; 3) access provincial COVID-19 data to trend outbreak and infection rates with changes in movement restrictions; 4) track outcomes related to health, well-being and function (e.g. RAI-MDS scores for function in activities of daily living, cognition and mood for LTC residents; frailty scores and disease profiles for LTC home residents) to measure the impact of movement restrictions on the well-being, health and function of Ontario LTC home residents; and 5) conduct qualitative interviews to describe the experience of movement restrictions and implications for residents, family members and LTC and retirement home staff. These data and methods will enable us to identify the impact of restrictions on health, well-being and function in the short and longer term. Impact and expected outcomes: This is the first study examining the impact of restrictions in LTC and retirement homes on residents' health, well-being and function, and implications for family and staff. This novel and highly relevant study will provide much needed knowledge to inform practice in LTC and retirement care homes to reduce potential harms in this and future pandemic situations.","10, 9","10a, 9a"
P23538,Role and modulation of Zinc-finger antiviral protein and antiviral Regnase-1-like endonucleases,"The human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is capable of inhibiting several major human pathogens, including Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. ZAP specifically targets CpG dinucleotides in RNAs and might be one of the reasons why CpGs are strongly suppressed in the human genome. Successful viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, mimic human CpG suppression to partially evade the inhibitory effects of ZAP. However, especially under conditions of infection or inflammation when ZAP is expressed at high levels, it inhibits both CpG containing viral as well as cellular RNAs. Importantly, ZAP itself does not possess RNAse activity and is dependent on cofactors, such as KHNYN, to destroy viral RNAs. KHNYN is tightly regulated and inactivated by MALT-1, a cellular protease representing an important target in cancer immunotherapies. Although some progress has been made, the identity of ZAP cofactors as well as their mechanism(s) of action and therapeutic potential are poorly understood. This proposal aims to combine the expertise of the applicant (mechanistic studies of ZAP and RNA-targeting factors) and the host (respiratory viruses and antiviral drug development) to define how ZAP-dependent and independent antiviral endonucleases restrict major respiratory viral pathogens. In addition, it will be examined whether MALT-1 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials against cancers allow to enhance and maintain the antiviral activity of ZAP and its cofactors thus offering prospects for the treatment of respiratory infections.  Finally, potential side-effects on cellular RNAs and their impact on immune signalling, cell activation and infection outcome will be determined. The project will combine innovative CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, in vitro virus infection platforms, novel functional assays and state-of-the-art deep sequencing technologies to significantly advance the knowledge on antiviral RNAses and to clarify whether they can be strengthened for antiviral therapy.",6,6a
C00109,Plasmonic PCR: Rapid Point-of-Care COVID-19 Diagnostic Platform.,"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates how in today's age infectious agents can spread rapidly. Given the ability of individuals to travel across the globe infectious agents can reach pandemic/epidemic proportions quickly, as seen with SARS and MERS outbreaks. Such viral agents become infectious because of genetic alterations many times occurring in other animals and eventually can infect humans. There are no effective anti-viral agents nor have vaccines been developed. Thus during these outbreaks we can only rely on infection control measures. Such measures help control the spread of the disease but is dependent on verifying individuals who are infected and those who are not infected. Presently diagnosing COVID-19 infections is inadequate as the laboratory tests may take 24-48 hrs to be completed. Such time periods make infection control very difficult. In this proposal we discuss how a rapid testing and diagnosis be made in the order of minutes. We have developed a revolutionary methodology that would construct a diagnostic device which is small and portable, and even be battery operated. Our device would be a true point of care platform that would be used at the ""first contact"" between patient and health professional. Our point of care testing platform would give rapid result in minutes and would help enormously in infection control management of not only the current COVID-19 outbreaks but also future pathogenic viral outbreaks which are surely to happen.",1,1a
C10739,Coping strategies and mental health: quantitative and qualitative insight into the COVID-19 experience in young adults,"Accumulating evidence suggests that COVID-19 is affecting mental health and well-being, and that young adults are hardest hit. Not addressing this issue could have important impact on the ability of young adults to ""pick up where they left off,"" especially if this increased vulnerability erodes their enthusiasm, hope and resiliency to fully re-engage post-pandemic when doing so is critical for their families, society and the economy. Yet fundamental evidence that could inform policy and programming in Canada is lacking, including descriptions on how mental health has evolved among Canadians during COVID-19, better understanding of coping strategies used by young adults to deal with COVID-19 stress (i.e., substance use, physical activity, screen time, online support groups, reliance on social media), whether these coping strategies helped, and identification of specific higher-risk subgroups of young adults that need help the most (e.g., mothers balancing telework with childcare; heads of households who lost their jobs; vulnerable young adults unable to access mental health services). To address these gaps, we will leverage data from two well-established cohorts of young adults in two provinces with very different COVID-19 experiences (NDIT in Quebec; MATCH in New Brunswick). NDIT has pre-pandemic data in 24 data collections spanning age 12 to 33 (1999- 2020). MATCH has 25 data collections spanning age 9 to 20 (2011- 20). More specifically, we will use pre- and early pandemic data in combination with newly collected quantitative and qualitative data in Fall 2021 and Fall 2022, to monitor trends in mental health and coping strategies in both cohorts. Qualitative data on the pandemic lived experience will be collected in 85 one-on-one interviews. These data, combined with ongoing consultations with our knowledge users, will inform discussion on developing, repurposing, and scaling up mental health interventions targeting young adults during pandemics.",10,10a

C19634,Development of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for which there are no treatments yet available. We propose to rapidly design and test several drugs that could be delivered intranasally to treat SARS-CoV-2. We will also analyze the immune response to the virus in patient cells to determine a possible correlation between the early response and the outcome of the disease. The technology we will use is called RNA interference and it works by using what are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siRNAs can direct a person's existing RNA interference machinery to attack any harmful RNA sequence such as the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, by reducing the viral burden, siRNAs could contribute to mounting a patient's natural immune response to the virus. We will also design siRNAs to target any factor that would prevent the immune response in the early phase of the disease. siRNAs are easy to design, manufacture and are stable for long-term storage and transport. An advantage for their use as therapy for respiratory infections is that they remain in the lungs when administered intranasally and therefore have low potential to cause side-effects in other parts of the body. We expect that from our project we will identify a safe and effective treatment that could be used in the fight against the current pandemic and future outbreaks of related coronaviruses.","1, 6","1d, 6a"
P21770,Comparative Analysis of Bunyavirus Neuropathogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Bunyaviruses are a large, diverse group of vector-borne viruses with the capacity to cause neurological disease  with morbidity and mortality. A major limitation in our basic scientific understanding of bunyavirus  neuropathogenesis stems from the fact that key target cells in the brain are not fully defined, therefore the effect  of infection on target cells is unknown, and viral determinants that contribute to neurological disease have not  been delineated. A broader, understanding of how bunyaviruses interact with the central nervous system (CNS),  including molecular mechanisms of host-viral interactions, is fundamental for future goal of mitigating effects of  disease and long-term sequelae in survivors. Here, we propose a comparative analysis of the basic  neuropathogenesis of 3 important emerging bunyaviruses: Rift Valley fever (RVFV), Oropouche (OROV), and  La Crosse (LACV). Infection by each of these viruses have the potential to cause significant neurological disease  in humans. However, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of bunyavirus neuropathogenesis, including  molecular mechanisms that contribute to disease. A limitation is the lack of rigor of prior research is that published  studies on these viruses as they are difficult to directly compare due to use of different in vitro cell systems and  disparate mouse models, including variations in age and infection route. We will address this gap by directly  comparing CNS cell tropism, innate responses, and cell death pathways induced by RVFV, OROV, and LACV  using novel in vitro and ex vivo model systems. Given the potential for diverse bunyaviruses to cause  neurological sequelae in a subset of human cases, and the fact that all 3 are lethal in neurological mouse models,  we hypothesize that diverse bunyaviruses have common target cells in the CNS and that neuronal infection is  mediated by Lrp1, a newly identified host entry factor for RVFV. A key feature of bunyaviral virology is the  expression of the viral non-structural protein produced from the small genome segment (NSs). NSs is the main  antagonist of host cell antiviral responses. Each virus expresses a different NSs protein, and thus we further  hypothesize that the degree of neurovirulence of each virus is directly related to NSs protein function, with RVFV  NSs being the most potent inhibitor of innate responses. Our highly collaborative and synergistic team is led by  Dr. Amy Hartman (PI), an expert in the pathogenesis of RVFV, Dr. Anita McElroy (Co-I), a molecular virologist  and immunologist with expertise in emerging viral diseases, Dr. Gaya Amarasinghe (Co-I), a biochemist with  expertise in host-pathogen interactions. Two additional Co-IÃ¢Â€Â™s are Dr. Leonard DÃ¢Â€Â™Aiuto and Dr. Zachary Wills,  who are experts in viral infection of human neurons and rodent neurobiology, respectively. This R01 proposal  represents a multidisciplinary approach to advance our understanding of bunyavirus interactions with the brain.",1,"1b, 1e"
C01189,"COVID 19 - Reduced Air Traffic due to Coronavirus, Environmental Impacts","The aviation industry is responsible for at least 5% human climate impact, despite producing only 2.5% of CO2 emissions. A key driver of this is contrails, which have a particularly large effect by trapping heat in the troposphere. However, their impact is poorly understood due to difficulties in studying contrails, especially for situations where contrails spread out into large, long-lived, cirrus clouds. The unprecedented reduction in aviation due to the pandemic allows us to isolate and track individual contrails using satellite data, which is usually very challenging. The relatively clear skies during the pandemic also enable us to much better estimate the impact of aviation by comparing airspace and contrail formation during the shutdown against normal conditions. Furthermore, as the pandemic subsides there is a unique and urgent opportunity for the UK government to support aviation in an economically and environmentally friendly manner - especially in the context of controversial decisions such as Heathrow's third runway. This project will use unique data sources to conduct cutting-edge research into aviation's environmental impact, contrails in particular, to allow the government to make evidence-based decisions on financial and regulatory support to the industry as it returns to flight operations in the future.",10,10d
P21491,Elucidating the molecular determinants of Henipavirus envelope-antibody and envelope-receptor interactions on viral entry,"PROJECT SUMMARY:  The identification of new Henipaviruses (HNVs) in Africa, China and Australia lend way to concerns about the  risk of possible spillover events. Yet, there are no FDA approved therapeutics and the role of receptor usage on  pathogenicity is still undetermined. Within this proposal, we aim to leverage our extensive preliminary results  to further our understanding of the molecular determinants of envelope-antibody and envelope-receptor  interactions on viral neutralization and viral pathogenicity. In recent work, we have identified an immune-  accessible region on the NiV and HeV fusion glycoprotein that is targeted by several antibodies. Experiments  proposed in Aim 1 will elucidate a mechanism for how these antibodies neutralize HNVs and will characterize  novel antibodies against the divergent GhV fusion glycoprotein by utilizing a rapid, directed-evolution platform  to identify escape mutants. Additionally, we have performed structure-guided mutagenesis to better  understand HNV receptor binding protein and receptor interactions. The experiments directly proposed in Aim  2 will further characterize these mutants and assess the ability to confer use of this receptor to other HNVs using  viruses. The work proposed here will ultimately support the development of HNV therapeutics and the  understanding of the contributions of receptor usage on HNV pathogenicity.",1,"1b, 1c, 1d"
C20730,"Mobilizing the Chinese Immigrant Community and Battling the Potential COVID-19 outbreak in the Greater Toronto Area: Gathering essential information, creating a mutual support quarantine network and assessing psychological impacts","The COVID-19 outbreak is raging in China and spreading across the globe. The situation is getting worse and may last longer than anyone can expect.  Despite of only eight confirmed cases, Canada is now shrouded in fear and worry in face of uncertainty.    The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has one of the largest Chinese communities in the world and thus bears the brunt of the fear, anxiety, and panic. This, coupled with English language obstacles, has enabled rumors and misinformation to explode on social media.  It has been suggested that the Toronto Chinese community is the most vulnerable, yet least prepared population for the potential COVID-19 outbreak. There is an urgent need to prepare and mobilize the GTA Chinese community to fight against the possible outbreak.   In this context, the overarching goal of the proposed work is to assess the knowledge, develop effective epidemic control practice, and identify the psychological impacts of the disease. This will be achieved through coordinated efforts across communities, professionals, and local residents, to address three specific and inter-related objectives: 1) assessing GTA Chinese immigrants' knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, and protection practices toward COVID-19; 2) developing, evaluating, and optimizing a mutual-support quarantine network to contain COVID-19 from further spreading; and 3) assessing the psychological impacts and the associated predictors of the potential COVID-19 outbreak.   The proposed project is culturally relevant, practical, and community-based. The research team is comprised of multidisciplinary researchers from the related fields of public health (epidemiology), psychology, sociology, and health policy. As part of the ongoing effort, the team has been closely working with the GTA Chinese community in various ways. This project will benefit not only the target population but also other communities in Canada.","5, 9","5a, 9a, 9b, 9c, 10a"

C09632,Barriers faced by urban homeless women in accessing Maternal and Child Health Services in the wake of COVID-19 in Delhi,"1)	Project Background, context and needs addressed    The provision of maternal healthcare in India is grossly inadequate, characterized by high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity and underutilisation of services, especially among the poor. While the maternal mortality ratio has reduced in India (Office of the Registrar General, India, 2018), the country is far behind the goal of achieving SDG target of 70 deaths per 1,00,000 live births (Suri, 2019). Studies indicate low levels of utilization of maternal health care among the urban poor (Agarwal et al., 2007; Siddaiah et al., 2018) as well as  poor health outcomes such as prevalence of anaemia (Diamond-Smith et al., 2016; Dwarkanath et al., 2018).   An ongoing ethnography carried out by researchers at the George Institute for Global Health (January 2019-June 2020) in Delhi, India, identified barriers to utilization of Maternal and Child Healthcare (MCH) services among homeless women. This is shaped by the unique vulnerabilities faced by the homeless as well as the lack of outreach of the health system. With the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in India, we have begun to observe that the homeless are unable to practise ideas of physical distancing, handwashing and other aspects of infection control, which places them at disproportionate risk of infection. Worse, with an already overburdened public health system having the pressure to manage and treat COVID-19 patients (Kumar & Jeelani, 2020), other health services, including long established ones related to MCH, are being affected. Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by activists earlier this month suggest that denial of services is taking place (Pal, 2020). Whether and in what ways MCH service delivery for homeless women is affected, remains unknown.  The study will examine the barriers faced by urban homeless women in Delhi in accessing MCH services as a consequence of the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study will supplement the ethnography by demonstrating how the pandemic has affected health-seeking of urban homeless women vis-à-vis MCH services. The findings will be useful in informing policy about how MCH services can be streamlined and be made more accessible in the current context, providing critical insights for the PIL as well as for health system actors involved with planning and delivering services to the urban homeless and poor.    2)	Aims or research questions being addressed      What are the barriers faced by urban homeless women in Delhi in accessing and utilizing MCH services in the wake of public hospitals being overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases?     3)	Study Design    Qualitative research methods will be used to get an understanding of the present situation of urban homeless women and the challenges that confront them in the wake of the lockdown enforced because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In depth interviews (IDI) will be supplemented by field observations to see the changes that have taken place in the lives of urban homeless women in two field sites in Delhi where the recent ethnography was done. At one field site, women stay with their families under a flyover in temporary enclosures. At another field site, single women stay in pavements or nearby shelters. Key Informant Interviews will be done with activists involved in filing the PIL as well as practitioners involved in advocacy pertaining to arranging food for migrants stranded in cities after the lockdown. We expect to be able to conduct IDIs with 15 women and three key informants. We will be guided by the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines for qualitative research (Tong et al., 2007).    Data collection     Convenience sampling will be used to speak with women at the field site. Given the contagious nature of the current pandemic, verbal consent procedures will be used. Neither signatures will be taken on paper, nor will verbal consent be recorded. The purpose of the study will be explained to participants in detail, including the risks and benefits of participation. Precautions will be taken to maintain distance from participants to ensure distancing norms so as to safeguard the health of both the interviewer as well as interviewees.     After obtaining permission from participants, interviews will be audio-recorded. Data will be stored in password-protected laptops belonging to research team members. A consultant will be hired for transcription of interviews, and asked to sign confidentiality agreement.     Data analysis    As in the case of the earlier ethnographic research, thematic analysis will be used to interpret findings from fieldnotes and interview transcripts. Atlas.TI software will be used for analysis, with the researcher and her supervisor carrying out coding and iteratively developing and applying a codebook. Analysis will adhere to COREQ and existing standards of quality in qualitative research, including member checking/respondent validation, reflexivity, and fair dealing (Mays & Pope 2000).     4)	Approach used to maximise the impact of research outputs, to improve health and the research community    This study will be conducted in partnership with our long-term collaborator Centre for Equity Studies (CES), an organization we have collaborated with for the recent ethnography as well. CES runs recovery shelters in collaboration with Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board of the Delhi government for ailing homeless women and women. The organization additionally provides mobile van based health services to urban homeless people in several locations in Delhi and other cities in India.  In the wake of the lockdown enforced in India in second half of March 2020, members of CES along with other practitioners have been involved with advocacy for the urban poor and migrants who have been displaced as well as working alongside the Delhi government to make arrangements for the distribution of food to urban poor people living in various parts of the city.     The findings of our study can therefore be used by CES to improve and streamline their service delivery and support of MCH related health-seeking and service utilisation. Further, we believe their association with the Delhi government will be useful in helping us share the findings of the study with government for its immediate perusal so that action may be timely taken to safeguard the health of urban homeless women.   Based on the findings of the study, we will also make a fact-sheet on the needs of the community during the pandemic and carry out dissemination with the organisations involved PIL as well other non-governmental organizations and fund-raising entities working with the homeless and/or urban poor.     5)	Expected outcomes    The findings will:    •	Be useful in helping our partner organization, CES, in realigning their current strategies towards prioritizing services for urban homeless pregnant and lactating women.  •	Add to the evidence base for the urban poor and contribute towards larger subsequent grants to test interventions for improvement of MCH outcomes.  •	Supplement the PIL by providing evidence for the state government to reorient health services for maternal and child healthcare for urban poor women in public hospitals.    6)	Your role in the project    The applicant will be engaged in making of interview guide, consent procedures, and in getting the approval from Institutional Ethics Committee. She will also be engaged in data collection, that is conducting interviews,  as well as in the analysis of data, and writing of the report, in addition to the subsequent writing of manuscripts. All of this will be done under the supervision of her supervisor, Dr Devaki Nambiar.    References  Agarwal, P., Singh, M. M., & Garg, S. (2007).

C20315,COVID19's Impact on Refugee/Migrant Equity-Deserving Groups in Latin America,"Venezuela has been experiencing a severe socioeconomic and political crisis for several years, now compounded by COVID19. With 7.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Venezuela and another 5.6 million Venezuelans in need in other countries, it is now the world's second-largest external displacement crisis after Syria. COVID19 has exacerbated long-standing socioeconomic inequalities between migrants and local communities. This has created an urgent need for research on how the COVID19 pandemic is impacting refugees and migrants in Latin America as well as differential and disproportionate effects on known equity-deserving groups.  We will conduct mixed methods research using an innovative 'SenseMaking' (SM) approach to understand the broader impacts of COVID19 in Latin America with a particular focus on different groups of refugees and migrants, including women/girls, LGBTIQ+ individuals, and persons with disabilities. SM is based on the recognition that storytelling is a natural way to convey complex information and is used by individuals to make sense of their experiences. Using SM, participants audio-record a story in response to an open-ended prompt, thus generating the qualitative data. After the recording, participants then interpret their own experiences by plotting their perspectives. SM quantifies each of the plotted points, providing statistical data backed up by the accompanying explanatory narratives.  Multiple-choice questions collect demographic information and help to contextualize the shared story. By collecting many self-interpreted stories, SM leverages the ""wisdom of the crowds,"" and collectively, the participants' interpretation responses create a nuanced picture in the same way pixels come together to produce a clear image.   Objectives: We will use SM to holistically examine the social, economic, security, health, and cultural impacts of COVID19 among refugee/migrant equity-deserving groups in Latin America.",10,"10a, 10b"
P22837,Seasonal and universal Vaccination in aged populations with pre-existing immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Current influenza (flu) vaccination based on hypervariable hemagglutinin (HA) protein fails to provide  effective cross protection. The efficacy of vaccination is low in the aged populations even with pre-existing  immunity. The impacts of pre-existing immunity on the immunogenicity and efficacy of universal and seasonal  vaccination largely remain not well understood in the aged populations. Development of new flu vaccines and  vaccination strategies improving cross protective efficacy in young naÃƒÂ¯ve and aged hosts with pre-existing  immunity is of high priority. Mono conserved antigenic targets inducing cross protection tested in naÃƒÂ¯ve animal  models include the flu A virus M2 extracellular domain (M2e), HA-stalk domains, and neuraminidase (NA) were  reported but insufficient for translation to humans. The multi-target universal vaccines in naÃƒÂ¯ve and aged hosts  with pre-existing immunity remain to be developed.   We developed heterologous tandem repeat of M2e (5xM2e) presented on immunogenic virus-like  particles (5xM2e VLP). Vaccination with 5xM2e VLP was effective in broadening cross protection but  suboptimal. A further improved universal vaccine should be developed. Our preliminary studies found  synergistic effects on improving cross protection by both M2e and NA immunity. Therefore, as a new universal  vaccine candidate, we developed a multi NA + 5xM2e VLP vaccine containing multi-subtype NA and 5xM2e on  the same VLP particle. In addition, we newly designed genetically linked novel recombinant M2e-stalk  universal protein vaccines effectively inducing both M2e and HA-stalk immunity and conferring broad cross-  group protection. Adjuvanted universal vaccination will overcome the aging-related immune senescence by  activating T and B immune cells in naÃƒÂ¯ve hosts or aged populations under pre-existing immunity.   In this project, we will test the hypothesis that new universal vaccination inducing multi immunity (M2e,  Stalk, NA) will enhance the breadth and efficacy of cross protection in adult and aged populations with or  without pre-existing immunity. Under Aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of multi-target universal vaccines in  young adult mice and ferrets under naÃƒÂ¯ve and pre-existing immune conditions. In Aim 2 studies, we will  determine the durability of cross protective immunity by multi targeting new universal vaccines and test a  vaccination strategy enhancing cross protection in aged mouse and ferret animal models. In the Aim 3, we will  investigate cross protective immune mechanisms of multi targeting universal vaccination in young and aged  mouse models. The outcomes in this project will be highly significant in the aspect of translational science and  relevance to improve the cross protective efficacy of flu vaccination.","1, 4, 7","1d, 4b, 7a, 7l"

Novel therapeuticsare desperately needed, and as we are currently investigating anti-flavivirus properties of cyclodextrincompounds (CDs), which have broad antiviral activity, we propose here to expand this investigation to test thesecompounds for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in human bronchial epithelial cells (Aim 1). First, we will fast-track theFDA-approved CDs in our collection, and then screen the rest. OSC Dr. Ralph Baric (UNC) will confirm our mostpromising candidates in primary human cells and collaborate on setting up further studies to test them in hismouse models. Based on previous literature and data acquired through the parent grant, we hypothesize thatthese compounds may have direct virucidal activity by inactivating virions, as well as potentially inhibiting cellattachment by blocking the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) from interacting with glycans and/or the viralreceptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface. Though infected patients succumb toacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involving vascular leak, the viral triggers of this pathology areunclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-1 found that internalization of ACE2 along with virus particles uponinfection reduces ACE2 levels on the cell surface, resulting in increased angiotensin II activity. The angiotensinII activity is believed to result in upregulation of vasoactive molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factorF (VEGF) and disruption of intercellular junctions, both inducing vascular leak. In Aim 2, our optimized systemfor the study of endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting from many years of work with flaviviruses and included inthe parent grant, will be applied to investigate SARS-CoV-2 vascular pathology induced by the viral S proteinand secondary mediators like VEGF. As we have already observed in vitro anti-leak as well as antiviral propertiesfor some of the tested CDs, we also propose to test these candidates as therapeutics to treat COVID-19 diseasemanifestations. As such, this supplemental grant proposal has the potential to define triggers of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated vascular leak, contributing to ARDS, as well as testing CDs as therapeutics targeting viral infectiondirectly and indirectly via downstream pathogenesis. FDA-approved CDs and derivatives that prove to beeffective as COVID-19 treatments have the potential to be rapidly developed for potential use in patients.1",6,"6a, 6g"
C07189,Culturally-targeted communication to promote SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in saliva:  Enabling evaluation of inflammatory pathways in COVID-19 racial disparities,"Project Summary: African Americans develop and die from SARS-CoV-2 infection more than any other racial group in the UnitedStates, including in majority African American cities such as Flint, Michigan. SARS-CoV-2 disparities stem frommany interconnected causes. Yet, connections to inflammatory biological processes in COVID-19 disparitiesremain largely unknown. Evaluating inflammatory responses can be facilitated by SARS-CoV-2 antibodytesting, which can be used to identify and compare inflammation among those with and without confirmedSARS-CoV-2 infection, and to conduct cross-race comparisons of inflammatory factors. However, AfricanAmericans will be reluctant to partake in conventional antibody testing programs due to medical mistrust andexperiences with racism that are salient in the COVID-19 era. There is thus an urgent need to develop anddeploy culturally-relevant communication and antibody testing programs. Our long-term goal is to identify andreduce unjust COVID-19 racial disparities. The immediate objective is to better encourage understanding anduptake of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be receptive toantibody testing when benefits and limitations are communicated in a culturally effective manner, and whennon-invasive salivary collection methods and assays are used. Our rationale is that combining culturallyeffective health communication with salivary testing will reduce mistrust and promote uptake that can lead tobetter grasping the role of inflammation in COVID-19 disparities. Our aims are to 1) develop and compareeffects of a general versus culturally-targeted video about antibody testing on African American and White Flintresidents' antibody testing attitudes and uptake; 2) identify and compare effects of a general versus culturally-targeted video on activation of medical mistrust and racism-related cognition among African Americans whenconsidering antibody testing; 3) measure and identify multi-analyte inflammatory biomarker profiles among FlintRegistry enrollees who complete salivary antibody testing and compare inflammatory biomarker profiles byrace and antibody status. In collaboration with clinical and community partners, we will prepare and evaluategeneral and culturally-targeted video tutorials about SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. These brief videos will bedistributed to the Flint community through the Flint Registry - a highly visible local health resource exchange.In collaboration with leading salivary bioscience experts, we will furnish an opportunity to engage in at-homesalivary antibody screening - a non-invasive route to antibody testing that is highly suited to disparities-oriented COVID-19 research. The proposed research is innovative and significant in highlighting that culturally-targeted communication and non-invasive antibody testing are vital to propelling disparities-orientedinflammatory COVID-19 research. Knowledge to be gained includes video tutorials and insights aboutcommunity-facing salivary collection that can be immediately disseminated across SeroNet to better promoteincluding racial monitories in ongoing studies of inflammation and antibody testing.","4, 9","4a, 9a, 9b, 9c"
C00867,COVID R PA-18-591 NOT-AI-20-031 Administrative Supplement to Integrated Exchange and Storage of Current- and Future-Generation Immunogenomic Data,"While little is known about the impact of host genetic factors on the risk for infection, morbidity and mortality inCOVID-19, current epidemiology reveals wide variation in disease course among confirmed cases of infectionthat is not fully explained by known comorbidities and other risk factors. Because of its pivotal role in the immuneresponse and long-established associations with disease phenotypes, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)variation will likely be found to play a key role in COVID-19 outcomes. Understanding the role of HLA variationwill provide important insights relevant to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, while also informing vaccinedevelopment and potential immunotherapies (e.g. T-cell based therapies). Because the complexity and extremepolymorphism of the HLA region make consolidation, equivalency, analysis, and biological interpretation of HLAdata challenging, it is our view that a centralized resource that aggregates data from disparate sources andplatforms and provides well-curated bioinformatics and analytical tools will serve to accelerate discovery. Underthe parent grant we continue to develop a suite of tools and programs for the standardized analysis, collection,exchange and storage of immunogenetic data, and these tools are being widely adopted by the immunogeneticscommunity. This supplement request will allow us to apply these tools toward the development and applicationof a pair of web resources. The first will centralize access to COVID-19-related HLA data and HLA data-management and analysis tools, creating a knowledge base and technical resource for HLA and immunogeneticsresearch on the COVID-19 pandemic. As an initial step in advancing this vision, we have launched thehlacovid19.org website. The second resource will connect COVID-19 researchers and clinicians in need of HLAtyping services with the immunogenetics laboratories that can provide them. As an early step toward this goal,we have formed the COVID-19 HLA & Immunogenetics Consortium to unite the global community of HLA andimmunogenetics experts and leaders in support of these efforts, and harness the collective experience andexpertise of the HLA and immunogenetics community as part of the global effort to combat this pandemic.",13,

C10581,Application of AI to the immediate prediction of time series to optimize resource management in epidemics,"Given the uncertainty generated by the health crisis, and from the large amount of data that is generated every day on the COVID19 disease, we propose to apply the most modern and reliable techniques for analysis and prediction of spatio-temporal series using / deep-learning / and others paradigms of artificial intelligence. The objective is to immediately develop predictive systems for infections, admissions, ICU patients and deaths by province and autonomous community, together with other magnitudes (logistical, economic, ...) that allow to guide more effectively the action of the Ministry of Health in this and other crises. In addition, a retrospective analysis is proposed that makes it possible to determine a posteriori the start date of each outbreak of the epidemic as well as visualization tools and dashboards that allow the extraction of useful knowledge and facilitate decision-making based on the data."," 3,4","3d, 4c"
P25378,Coproducing improved mental health acute inpatient discharge using a Systems Approach: MINDS study,"Research questions    1. What are the requirements of service users (SUs) being discharged from adult mental health wards?  2. How is personalised discharge planning understood by SUs, carers and staff and what do they identify as key outcomes to determine this?  3. How do active components of discharge planning and their relationships to each other at individual, interpersonal, community, organisational and policy levels meet SU discharge requirements?  4. How does an understanding of the interaction between system and SU requirements inform a Systematic Discharge Care Approach (SDCA) that supports discharge planning?  5. How can we implement the SDCA to improve SU outcomes?      Background    Pre-COVID-19, around 50,000 people were discharged from acute mental health settings annually and pressures of the pandemic have increased this. The transition period following discharge is the highest risk area of mental health provision in terms of relapse, readmission, and suicide. Before COVID-19, 13% of SUs in England were quickly readmitted and 32% of suicides were within 2 weeks. COVID-19 has complicated this with significant increases in rapid discharge, exacerbation of mental health difficulty and social distancing rules that impede transition.    Preparing and planning discharge with SUs, carers and supporters. is critical to aiding successful transition from ward to home and managing this high-risk period. However, evidence suggests that people are often given little (if any) notice of their discharge and are rarely meaningfully involved in discharge planning. Discharge takes place within complex ward systems but previous attempts at intervention development have neglected systemic factors; this has resulted in inconsistent and poor outcomes. This project integrates realist methodology and an engineering-informed healthcare systems approach to build programme theory and coproduce systemic discharge solutions to improve discharge outcomes. These coproduced solutions will be sensitive to SU and staff needs, transferrable across NHS acute mental health settings, easy to implement and so more sustainable than what is currently available.      Aims    Understand discharge planning as a complex intervention within complex systems and coproduce a SDCA. The MINDS study will evaluate the implementation and cost-impact of the SDCA ready for a future clinical trial.      Objectives    1. Understand discharge planning as a complex intervention within complex ward systems and the discharge planning requirements of people leaving the ward  2. Coproduce a SDCA involving discharge planning processes, personalised discharge planning tools, and system strengthening and implementation guidance  3. Evaluate acceptability, implementation and cost-impact of the SDCA      Methods    This study combines realist review and evaluation, an established engineering-informed systems approach to healthcare design (Engineering Better Care), with coproduction emphasised at all stages. Implementation and cost evaluation will be undertaken in line with MRC complex intervention development guidance.      Timelines for delivery  Delivered across 36 months    Anticipated impact and dissemination    Improving the problem of poor discharge would improve the lives, safety and mental health recovery of significant numbers of SUs annually. Dissemination plans include policy impact (including NICE), NHS services and grassroots SU organisations (including partner Mind).","10, 11","10a, 11a, 11f"
C20405,Virtual peer-to-peer (VP2P) mentoring for adolescents with congenital heart disease: A needs assessment and pilot randomized controlled trial,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in Canada, affecting about 1 in every 100 children. Adolescents with CHD (AWCHD) must learn to independently manage their disease and plan for the future, including the transition to adult care. Many young adults living with CHD find the transition from pediatric to adult care to be challenging, and research shows that between 21-76% of young adults experiences lapses in cardiology care. Patients who do not receive follow-up care as adults have an increased need for urgent interventions and are at an increased risk of requiring hospital admission. These lapses in care can be caused by a range of factors, but often they are related to the challenges young adults experience when learning how to navigate adult healthcare systems, advocate for themselves, and develop self-management and coping skills. One intervention that has helped young adults develop some of these skills to support the transition is peer mentorship. Peer mentorship has been shown to improve health outcomes and symptoms for adolescents with chronic disease, however no research to date has examined the role of peer support for AWCHD. There is a need now more than ever to develop and test virtual support interventions as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions have limited opportunities for AWCHD to receive peer support. Therefore, the goal of this study to refine and test a virtual peer mentorship intervention for AWCHD which will provide emotional and social support, encourage AWCHD to develop and engage in self-management and transition skills, and provide education related to CHD. This study will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 - a needs assessment, and Phase 2 - a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility of delivering this intervention. This research will enable us to tailor this unique peer mentorship program to the CHD population, which will allow further study and clinical implementation.",10,10a
P24964,RAPID: Efficiency of proteolytic activation of respiratory viruses as a marker for pandemic potential (subproject P4-DPZ).,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory infections. The pathogen was discovered in 2012 during a fatal viral pneumonia in Saudi Arabia. Specific treatment options do not yet exist. Up to 30 percent of those infected die. The infection is usually rare. It is usually acquired through contact with dromedaries, which are one of the main livestock in the Middle East and parts of Africa. However, human-to-human transmission does occur and leads to larger outbreaks. The virus is not yet well adapted to humans as hosts. However, there are fears of mutations that could lead to a higher risk of infection and subsequently a pandemic. MERS-CoV is therefore currently one of the most threatening, so-called ""pre-pandemic"" infectious pathogens.  In order to combat pre-pandemic pathogens efficiently, it is essential that the public health service obtains solid assessments of outbreak progressions. The research consortium therefore aims to use the example of MERS-CoV to address constraints and research questions for the public health service. In particular, approaches are to be developed that enable science and public health to detect the outbreak of pre-pandemic viruses earlier and prevent their transformation into pandemic pathogens. In addition, a vaccine for host animals and humans is to be developed in collaboration with partners in Saudi Arabia.  The network is part of the National Research Network on Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. In particular, the ""One Health"" approach (simultaneous consideration of human and veterinary aspects) and the transfer of results into the application of the public health service are being pursued.","2, 3, 7, 9","2a, 3a, 7a, 9a"

C06939,Colorado REACH Hub,"Project Summary: This application is being submitted by the Colorado AMC Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub(REACH) in response to NOT-EB-20-008, Availability of Administrative Supplements on BiomedicalTechnologies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedentedglobal impact. There is an urgent need to for accelerating the development, translation, and commercializationof technologies to address COVID-19. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)is seeking applications from current grantees to develop life-saving technologies that can be ready forcommercialization within one to two years. The Colorado AMC REACH Hub is addressing one of the areasidentified in NOT-EB-20-008, specifically, the need for rapid point-of-care and home-based testing/diagnostics.The Colorado AMC REACH Hub has received three applications from the NIH that were initially submitted to theRapid Acceleration of Diagnostic Technologies (RADx-Tech) program, a $500 million effort to significantlyincrease testing capacity and accessibility for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Many of theprojects that have been submitted to RADx-Tech have been deemed too early in development or have otherdevelopment challenges that have prevented them from meeting the selection criteria of increasing testingcapacity by the end of 2020. The three applications that were received from the NIH were selected by the RADx-Tech program for potential supplemental funding due to their promise and their suitability for commercializationassistance to be provided by the REACH program. REACH Hubs are designed to increase the speed andsuccess rate of translating biomedical academic discoveries into products to improve human health. Membersof an external review board with extensive experience in medical diagnostic technology development reviewedthe three RADx-Tech applications and approved them for acceptance into the Colorado AMC REACH Hubprogram. The three selected applications are: (1) Development of a point of care SARS-CoV-2 ELASA; (2)COVID-19 POC rapid antigen detection CLIA waived device; and (3) Rapid Synthetic Biology-Based Point ofCare Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Virus. The requested supplemental funding will be used to fund research toadvance these important projects through defined milestones and deliverables. The funding will include hiring aproject management team with extensive experience in commercializing diagnostic products to work with theexisting Colorado AMC REACH Hub project managers, the investigator's research team, and an NIHEntrepreneur in Residence to establish a product development plan that includes significant proof-of-conceptand/or validation milestones that can be met in less than 12 months. The project management team will closelymonitor progress on a regular basis with project support contingent upon satisfactory progress toward the agreedupon milestones/deliverables. The overall goal is to advance the projects to an inflexion point wherein thetechnology can be licensed to an existing or new company to further develop the commercial applications.",1,1a
P22208,Anchimerically Activatable Anti-Zika/Dengue ProTides,"Arboviruses such as, Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV), have been associated with several global epidemics.  DENV infections can result in a mild fever to potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever  and death, while ZIKV infections can result in congenital microcephaly and the development of autoimmune  diseases. Initial clinical manifestation of DENV and ZIKV disease are similar and co-infections have been  reported. Most challenging, DENV and ZIKV are known to co-circulate, increasing the probability of co-infections,  and thus the potential for severe disease. Consequently, since there is no effective vaccine or form of treatment  for either virus, the development of anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV therapeutics is an urgent unmet medical need.   Over the past decade prodrugs of nucleotides, referred to as ProTides, have been found to have potent  antiviral activity. The anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug sofosbuvir (FDA approved 2013) is the most notable  ProTide success, since its use in combination therapy can clear Hepatis C virus infections. Recently, a similar  ProTide, remdesivir, has been approved by the FDA, Japan, the European Union an Australia for the treatment  of severe SARs-CoV-2 infections by intravenous injection. Carboxyesterase-anhydride-HINT1 (CAH) ProTides,  such as sofosbuvir and remdesivir, utilize a four step activation process based on initial esterase hydrolysis,  carboxylic acid nucleophilic attack at the phosphorous and release of phenol, followed by mixed anhydride  chemical hydrolysis, and finally phosphoramidate hydrolysis by hHINT1. Unfortunately, although they can be  dosed intravenously, due to high first pass metabolism, CAH-Protides are limited in their use as oral drugs to  viral hepatitis. Furthermore, due to the high carboxyesterase activity of rodent plasma, it has been difficult to  carry out pre-clinical studies with rodents and translationally relevant dosages of CAH-ProTides.   To address the inherent issues surrounding current ProTide approaches, our group has  designed an alternative ProTide approach, we refer to as anchimerically HINT1 activated proTides  (AHA-ProTides). Our laboratory has demonstrated that AHA-proTides can be designed that are stable,  orally bioavailable, cell permeable and dependent on HINT phosphoramidate hydrolysis. Recently, we  have also demonstrated that AHA proTides can be prepared with enhanced potency against DENV  and ZIKV. Consequently, we propose to the design and develop anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV AHA  ProTides that can serve as advanced lead compounds for the potential treatment of both DENV  and ZIKV disease.",6,6a
C13804,Post COVID hyperinflammation: A syndrome beyond the name,"COVID-19 can threaten the live of previously healthy children. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) develops weeks after a mild or even asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Each wave of infections is closely followed by a wave of children across Canada and around the world presenting to hospital in shock and heart failure due to MIS-C, an uncontrolled post-COVID-19 inflammation. MIS-C closely resembles Kawasaki Disease (KD). KD causes fever and inflammation of blood vessels, most importantly the coronary arteries feeding the heart. Similar to KD, one in four children with MIS-C develops coronary artery disease.  It is critical to enable health care teams to rapidly identify high-risk children with MIS-C and control the life-threatening inflammation before it damages the child's heart. Our team has studied and dissected the reasons responsible for inflammation leading to shock and hyperinflammation in KD and have identified key biomarkers and optimal targets for treatment. These have been rapidly translated to the bedside resulting in new medications and improved outcomes. We urgently need to transfer these lessons to children with MIS-C and provide the desperately needed evidence to guide development of effective therapeutic approaches. Our team includes doctors, scientists, and families working together to tackle this serious disease. We will use machine learning and artificial intelligence strategies to analyze and integrate complex biologic and clinical data, in order to rapidly diagnose MIS-C and identify the children at highest risk. We've successfully done this before in other diseases. We already have a strong and deeply committed Canada-wide team, expertise and infrastructure in place from our other successful projects and national networks. We have international partner networks across Europe and the USA to share our discoveries most efficient and save the lives and protect the hearts of affected children around the world.",4,"4b, 4c, 4d"
